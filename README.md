* [guides](guides)

## Structure

Files that are included in more than one guide have prefixes to distingish their type of content as follows:

* `con`: File starting with `con_` contain concepts and explain the _what_ and _why_.
* `proc`: Files starting with `proc_` contain procedures and explain _how_ to achieve a specific goal.
* `ref`: Files starting with `ref_` contain references and append other files, e.g. tables with options.
* `snip`: Files starting with `snip_` contain snippets that are reused throughout multiple guides, e.g. admonitions.

## Conventions

* User input is surrounded by underscores (`_`) to indicate variable input, e.g. `hammer organization create --name "_My Organization_" --label "_my_organization_"`.
* A single line only contains one sentence.
Please do not wrap lines by hand.
This makes `git diff` much easier to read and helps reviewing changes.
* No trailing whitespace on lines and in files.
Whitespace after partial files has to be handled in the file using the `include::` directive.
* Source files use UTF-8 character encoding.

## Deployment

Github actions perform HTML (with link validation), PDF and WEB artifact creation and if suceeded and branch is master or stable, artifacts are downloaded, extracted and deployed (commited into gh-pages). Deployment does not delete files, in order to remove some unwanted content, manual deletion and push into gh-pages must be performed.

When a commit is pushed into `master`:

* All artifacts are built.
* Static WEB and HTML is downloaded and copied into `/` or `/nightly` respectively.
* Changes are pushed into `gh-pages` branch.

When a commit is pushed into `X.Y`:

* All artifacts are built.
* HTML artifact is downloaded and copied into `/X.Y`.
* Changes are pushed into `gh-pages` branch.

## Branching new release

* Create new directory [/web/content/version-X.Y](https://github.com/theforeman/foreman-documentation/tree/master/web/content/version-2.3) and copy `index.md` and edit it accordingly.
* Edit [/web/content/versions.md](https://github.com/theforeman/foreman-documentation/blob/master/web/content/versions.md) and add the new version to the menu.
* Push the changes into `master`.

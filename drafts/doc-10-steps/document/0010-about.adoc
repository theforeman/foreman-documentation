== About this Document
The primary goal of this solution guide is to provide an *end-to-end example of software life-cycle management using Red Hat Satellite 6*. It is based on an *sample customer scenario* including sample application architecture, sample datacenter topology and IT organization and roles. We’ve tried to describe a simple but realistic scenario and to explain all mandatory and additionally some advanced Satellite 6 capabilities and its configuration. Our focus has been more on the “why” instead of the “how”. Therefore a significant proportion of this solution guide is commited to *explain the non-technical concepts* behind. Nevertheless and given the characteristics of a Red Hat Reference Architecture / Solution Guide the implementation has been engineered, configured and validated in our lab.

Some tools used and items documented inside are not covered by Red Hat’s Global Support Services support contracts and coverage. We’ve marked all items which are not supported by Red Hat Global Support Services to avoid confusion about it. We’ve tried to provide in each particular area *different potential scenarios* to deal with and their advantages and disadvantages. In each of these areas we’ve picked *one scenario* and *documented its technical implementation*. Most of the automation we’ve used and provided inside this solution guide is based on a *naming convention* which will be explained in detail each time it is used it and summarized at the end of this document.

=== Target Audience
The target audience of this solution guide are primarily *customers who are new to Satellite 6*. Additionally we try to help *architects in different areas* of responsibility and interest to make some general design decisions if they’ve not been made yet. The multiple scenarios described in each section are supposed to let the audience decide which of these scenarios and in consideration of the documented advantages and disadvantages are the best fit for their environment or scenario. Additionally we describe the technical implementation of one complete configuration to satisfy the needs of people responsible for the *technical implementation* as well. The documentation of CLI based implementation is supposed to help customers more focusing on automation or integration of Satellite 6 capabilities into their environment.

=== ACME as a customer (and content) journey
The idea of using an sample company with a very limited complexity and declared as just founded is to provide a *customer journey which will be expanded over time*. This solution guide is supposed to become kind of a starting point or *foundation document* while other steps of this customer journey will follow over time.

Due to resource and time limitations and to reduce the complexity and content length of this document we’ve had to define some topics which are out of scope for this document. The purpose of the following list of excluded topics is to avoid disappointed readers who are primarily looking for these topics we do not cover inside this solution guide. The following Red Hat Satellite capabilities are either only covered very superficially or not at all:

// this has to be updated ofcourse.

* Red Hat Satellite 6 multi-org capabilities
* Red Hat Satellite 6 compute profiles
* Red Hat Satellite 6 Discovery feature
* openSCAP capabilities of Satellite 6.1
* Red Hat Access Insights capabilities of Satellite 6.1
* Subscription Management using virt-who
* Docker Imager Management capabilities of Satellite 6.1

Some other areas are so complex for its own and are worth to be covered in more details that we consider to write dedicated documents targeting these advanced use cases or scenarios. The goal of Step 10 is to provide some ideas about these advanced scenarios we might will cover in upcoming documents.

=== Comments and Feedback
In the spirit of open source, we invite anyone to provide feedback and comments on any solution guides. Although we review our papers internally, sometimes issues or typographical errors are encountered. Feedback allows us to not only improve the quality of the papers we produce, but allows the reader to provide their thoughts on potential improvements and topic expansion to the papers. Feedback on the papers can be provided by emailing refarch-feedback@redhat.com. Please refer to the title within the email. If you have other interesting use cases you want to see covered or even better have already figured out how to do this please do not hesitate to contact us via refarch-feedback@redhat.com.

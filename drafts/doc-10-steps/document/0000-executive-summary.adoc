== Executive Summary
Over time, the complexity of IT infrastructures increases. Businesses that ran on a small number of physical servers a decade ago have had to add more servers to grow and keep up with new technology. The advent of virtualization adds another layer of complexity to the complicated, multi-vendor environment, resulting in an environment that is difficult to navigate and control and increasing labor costs. With labor costs making up nearly 60% of overall IT infrastructure costs, the price of complexity adds up quickly.

Standardized operating environments help business operate effectively and efficiently. Red Hat solutions provide additional benefits, such as improved Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), better IT productivity, and increased agility, to drive your business forward. Red Hat Enterprise Linux with Red Hat Satellite provides an ideal platform for standardized operating environments with lower TCO and greater IT efficiency and productivity, adding to the bottom line and increasing business agility and competitiveness.

This reference guide provides an example implementation based on an example customer scenario including a distributed datacenter topology, example applications and an example IT organization and its roles. It is an end to end story starting with a fresh install of Satellite 6 and step by step configuring all necessary Satellite 6 objects up to an up and running infrastructure with servers and applications and their ongoing maintenance. Most parts of the setup could be automated using the powerful hammer command line interface which has been used while writing and is documented inside. Nearly all Satellite entities are covered, for the most critical ones like content views, host groups and lifecycle environments multiple scenarios are illustrated. Using this comprehensive documentation customers are able to configure Red Hat Satellite 6 in a way it fits best their needs. Further enhancements covering additional use cases, scenarios and technologies are currently in planning.

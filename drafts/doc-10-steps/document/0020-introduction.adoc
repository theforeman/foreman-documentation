== Introduction


The following chapter provides an overview of some important items that are explained in more detail within the solution guide.

=== Standard Operating Environment (SOE) Overview


With a variety of operating system vendors and versions, server hardware configurations, and management software tools, system and infrastructure administration becomes difficult at best. This complexity requires a large IT staff with deep expertise in all areas of the environment, further increasing costs.

In addition to interoperability issues, these management challenges lead to increased downtime and availability concerns with less visibility and control of assets. These issues increase security and compliance risks. When you have a multitude of disparate processes for each configuration or operating system version, the process of provisioning new tools, applications, virtual machines, and servers becomes slow and tedious and often hinders IT and business agility.

Many of these issues can be greatly diminished or even eliminated by reducing complexity and standardizing part or all of the IT environment on a set of processes and procedures. Management is simplified in a standardized operating environment (SOE), significantly increasing IT staff productivity and scalability. Because labor costs contribute significantly to overall IT costs, improving staff efficiency and productivity can lead to compelling savings and a lower total cost of ownership (TCO). Standard operating environments also benefit user productivity in terms of increased availability of services and less downtime. With standard operating processes and procedures, applications, virtual machines, and hardware can all be deployed and configured quickly, increasing flexibility, scalability, and business agility and productivity. Moreover, reduced infrastructure complexity allows better control of IT assets, improves security, and reduces compliance risks.

Standardization hinges on increasing consistency and reducing complexity within an operating environment. The ideal SOE implements a defined set of components, interfaces, and processes to be used throughout the entire IT infrastructure. While it may seem counter intuitive, standardization does not imply that all systems will be exactly the same; it simply means that all systems will have a defined, known foundation upon which a set of applications, virtual machines, and tools can be built.

Therefore standardization focuses on three main areas: simplification of the IT infrastructure, automation, and streamlining of management and administration tasks.

*Simplified, consistent infrastructure*

Reducing the number of variations in core technologies such as operating systems, administration tools, and security and compliance requirements creates an environment that is easier to manage.

*Streamlined Operation*

When a limited number of operating system versions are deployed in an IT infrastructure, it is possible to define a single, standard set of operating procedures and processes. This approach simplifies and streamlines operation.

*Automation*

Increased consistency and reduced complexity effectively enable environment automation. With only a few variations in the core system features, many repetitive, non-strategic tasks can be automated.

Moving your IT environment to a simplified, consistent architecture opens the door to many  benefits.

*Reduced Downtime*

Fewer OS variations decrease the statistical likelihood of operational and security issues that cause downtime. Better management practices, resulting from increased infrastructure consistency, catch issues before they bring down systems and applications. Simplified patch management ensures that systems are kept up-to-date and online.

*Lower Operational Costs*

As labor costs contribute significantly to overall IT costs, improving staff efficiency and productivity can lead to compelling savings and lower total cost of ownership (TCO). +
More Efficient IT Staff: Streamlined operations and processes allow a smaller staff to administer a larger number of physical and virtual systems more easily and efficiently. Extremely favorable administrator-to-system and -user ratios are possible with SOEs.

*Increased Productivity*

Because each administrator can manage a larger number of servers and users, the infrastructure can grow and scale without bringing on additional staff. Because deep expertise in multiple operating systems and kernel development is not required, IT staff can afford to focus on core business applications. Automation also returns valuable time to strategic tasks that move the business forward.

*Reduced Help Desk Workloads*

With more consistent services, fewer help desk tickets are filed, reducing the amount of time IT spends on help desk workloads, and increasing user productivity and uptime. +
Faster IT Response Times: With automation, new applications can be deployed to a large number of systems in a fraction of the time needed for manual deployment. Servers and virtual machines can be provisioned in a matter of hours and minutes, instead of days and hours.

*Increased Infrastructure Security and Control*

Reduced infrastructure complexity allows better control of IT assets, improves security, and reduces compliance risks.

*Greater Business Alignment and Agility*

On the business level, enhanced infrastructure agility facilitates increased competitiveness and alignment with goals, while reduced operational costs benefit the bottom line.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux with Red Hat Satellite provides an ideal platform for standardization. These two key components—the operating system, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and the systems management platform, Red Hat Satellite—work together to further enhance the benefits of standardized operating environments.


=== Red Hat Satellite 6 Overview


Red Hat Satellite is a system management solution that makes Red Hat infrastructure easier to deploy, scale, and manage across physical, virtual, and cloud environments. Satellite helps users provision, configure, and update systems to ensure they run efficiently, securely, and in compliance with various standards. By automating most tasks related to maintaining systems, Satellite helps organizations increase efficiency, reduce operational costs, and enable IT to better respond to strategic business needs.

Red Hat Satellite automates many tasks related to system management and easily integrates into existing workflow frameworks. The centralized console provides administrators one place for accessing reports and for provisioning, configuring, and updating systems.

*Provisioning*

Provision on bare metal, virtualized infrastructure, and on public or private clouds—all from one centralized console and with one simple process.

* Quickly provision and update your entire bare-metal infrastructure.
* Easily create and manage instances across virtualized infrastructure or private and public clouds.
* Create complex Kickstart and PXE scenarios with powerful variables and snippets.
* Discover and search across non-provisioned hosts for rapid deployment.

*Configuration management*

Analyze and automatically correct configuration drift and control, and enforce the desired host end-state, all from the Red Hat Satellite user interface (UI). This lets you configure Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems more efficiently for more agility.

* Integrate synchronizing Puppet modules. This integration provides the ability to manage, promote, and distribute configuration easily across your environment.
* Automatically correct system state with complete reporting, auditing, and history of changes.


*Software management*

Red Hat Satellite helps ensure a systematic process is used to apply content (including patches) to deployed systems— whether they are deployed on physical, virtual, or cloud infrastructure—in all stages from dev to production. This ensures better consistency and availability of systems, freeing IT to quickly respond to business needs and vulnerabilities.

* Content views are collections of RPMs, container content, or Puppet modules refined with filters and rules. Content views are published and promoted throughout lifecycle environments, enabling end-to-end system  management. While Satellite 5 used channels and cloning, content views in Satellite 6 contain both software and configuration content in one place, greatly simplifying managing the lifecycles of systems.

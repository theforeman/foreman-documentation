<h3 id="upgrading_prerequisites">1.1. Prerequisites</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Upgrading to Foreman 3.0 affects your entire Foreman infrastructure.
Before proceeding, complete the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Read the Foreman 3.0 Release Notes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Review this guide so that you are aware of the upgrade process and its impact.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plan your upgrade path.
For more information, see <a href="#upgrade_paths">Upgrade Paths</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plan for the required downtime. Foreman services are shut down during the upgrade.
The upgrade process duration might vary depending on your hardware configuration, network speed, and the amount of data that is stored on the server.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Upgrading Foreman takes approximately 1 - 2 hours.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Upgrading Smart&#160;Proxy takes approximately 10 - 30 minutes.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure that you have sufficient storage space on your server.
For more information, see <a href="https://docs.theforeman.org/3.0/Installing_Server_on_Red_Hat/index-foreman-el.html#preparing-environment-for-satellite-installation">Preparing your Environment for Installation</a> in <em>Installing Foreman&#160;server from a Connected Network</em> and <a href="https://docs.theforeman.org/3.0/Installing_Proxy_on_Red_Hat/index-foreman-el.html#preparing-environment-for-capsule-installation">Preparing your Environment for Installation</a> in <em>Installing Smart&#160;Proxy&#160;server</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Back up your Foreman&#160;server and all Smart&#160;Proxy&#160;servers.
For more information, see <a href="https://docs.theforeman.org/3.0/Administering_Red_Hat_Satellite/index-foreman-el.html##backing-up-satellite-server-and-capsule-server">Backing Up Foreman&#160;server and Smart&#160;Proxy&#160;server</a> in the <em>Administering Foreman</em> guide.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plan for updating any scripts you use that contain Foreman API commands because some API commands differ between versions of Foreman.
For more information about changes in the API, see the Red Hat Knowledgebase article <a href="https://access.redhat.com/articles/4396911">API Changes Between Foreman Versions</a> on the Red&#160;Hat Customer Portal.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can upgrade to Foreman 3.0 from Foreman 2.5.
Foreman&#160;servers and Smart&#160;Proxy&#160;servers on earlier versions must first be upgraded to Foreman 2.5.
For more information, see the Foreman 2.5 Upgrade documentation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Overview of Foreman 3.0 Upgrade Paths</div>
<p>The high level steps in upgrading to Foreman 3.0 are as follows.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Upgrade Foreman&#160;server and all Smart&#160;Proxy&#160;servers to Foreman 3.0.
For more information, see <a href="#upgrading_satellite_server_parent">Upgrading Foreman&#160;server</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upgrade to <a href="https://yum.theforeman.org/client/3.0/" class="bare">https://yum.theforeman.org/client/3.0/</a> on all Foreman clients.
For more information, see <a href="#upgrading_clients">Upgrading Foreman Clients</a>.</p>

</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="following_the_progress_of_the_upgrade">1.3. Following the Progress of the Upgrade</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because of the lengthy upgrade time, use a utility such as <code>screen</code> to suspend and reattach a communication session.
You can then check the upgrade progress without staying connected to the command shell continuously.
For more information about using the screen command, see <a href="https://access.redhat.com/articles/5247">How do I use the screen command?</a> article in the <em>Red&#160;Hat Knowledge&#160;Base</em>.
You can also see the <code>screen</code> manual page for more information.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you lose connection to the command shell where the upgrade command is running you can see the logs in <code>/var/log/foreman-installer/foreman.log</code> to check if the process completed successfully.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="upgrading_capsules-separately-from-satellite_upgrade-guide">1.4. Upgrading Smart&#160;Proxies Separately from Foreman</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can upgrade Foreman to the version 3.0 and keep Smart&#160;Proxies at the version 2.5 until you have bandwidth to upgrade them too.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All the functionality that worked previously works on 2.5 Smart&#160;Proxies.
However, the functionality added in the 3.0 release will not work until you upgrade Smart&#160;Proxies to 3.0.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Upgrading Smart&#160;Proxies after upgrading Foreman can be useful in the following example scenarios:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>If you want to have several smaller outage windows instead of one larger window.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If Smart&#160;Proxies in your organization are managed by several teams and are located in different locations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you use a load-balanced configuration, you can upgrade one load-balanced Smart&#160;Proxy and keep other load-balanced Smart&#160;Proxies at one version lower.
This allows you to upgrade all Smart&#160;Proxies one after another without any outage.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure that you do not delete the manifest from the Customer Portal or in the Foreman web UI because this removes all the entitlements of your content hosts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Back up and remove all Foreman hooks before upgrading.
Restore any hooks only after Foreman is known to be working after the upgrade is complete.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have edited any of the default templates, back up the files either by cloning or exporting them.
Cloning is the recommended method because that prevents them being overwritten in future updates or upgrades.
To confirm if a template has been edited, you can view its <strong>History</strong> before you upgrade or view the changes in the audit log after an upgrade.
In the Foreman web UI, navigate to <strong>Monitor</strong> &gt; <strong>Audits</strong> and search for the template to see a record of changes made.
If you use the export method, restore your changes by comparing the exported template and the default template, manually applying your changes.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that you cannot use tuning profiles on Smart&#160;Proxies.</p>

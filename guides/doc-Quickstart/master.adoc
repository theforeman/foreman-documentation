The Foreman installer is a collection of Puppet modules that installs everything required for a full working Foreman setup.
It uses native operating system packaging (`.rpm` or `.deb` packages) and adds necessary configuration for the complete installation.

Components include the Foreman web UI, Smart Proxy, a Puppet server, TFTP, DNS and DHCP servers.
It is configurable and the Puppet modules can be read or run in "no-op" mode to see what changes it will make.

The installation requires {project-minimum-memory} of memory.
For more information, see {InstallingServerDocURL}system-requirements_{project-context}[System Requirements].

The Foreman installer uses Puppet to install Foreman.
This guide assumes that you have a newly installed operating system, on which the installer will setup Foreman, a Puppet server, and the Smart Proxy by default.

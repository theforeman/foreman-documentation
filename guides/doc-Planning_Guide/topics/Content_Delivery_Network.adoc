== Content Delivery Network Structure

Red{nbsp}Hat Content Delivery Network (CDN), located at `cdn.redhat.com`, is a geographically distributed series of static webservers which include content and errata designed to be used by systems. This content can be accessed directly through a system registered using Red Hat Subscription Manager or through the {ProjectName} web UI. The accessible subset of the CDN is configured through subscriptions attached to a system using https://access.redhat.com/management/[Red{nbsp}Hat Subscription Management] or using {ProjectServer}.

Red{nbsp}Hat Content Delivery network is protected by X.509 certificate authentication to ensure that only valid users can access it.

<5> Directory responsible for the release version, such as `7`, `7.2` or `7Server`.
<6> Directory responsible for the base architecture, such as `i386` or `x86_64`.

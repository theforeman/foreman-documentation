== Introduction to {ProjectName}

ifndef::satellite[]
This guide contains information about features provided by the Katello plug-in.
If you do not plan to install the Katello plug-in, ignore these references.

_{ProjectName}_ is a system management solution that enables you to deploy, configure, and maintain your systems across physical, virtual, and cloud environments.
{Project} provides provisioning, remote management and monitoring of multiple {RHEL} deployments with a single, centralized tool.
_{ProjectName} Server_ synchronizes the content from Red{nbsp}Hat Customer{nbsp}Portal and other sources, and provides functionality including fine-grained life cycle management, user and group role-based access control, integrated subscription management, as well as advanced GUI, CLI, or API access.

_{ProjectName} {SmartProxyServer}_ mirrors content from {ProjectName} Server to facilitate content federation across various geographical locations.
Host systems can pull content and configuration from {SmartProxyServer} in their location and not from the central {ProjectServer}.
{SmartProxyServer} also provides localized services such as Puppet server, DHCP, DNS, or TFTP.
{SmartProxyServer}s assist you in scaling your {Project} environment as the number of your managed systems increases.

{SmartProxyServer}s decrease the load on the central server, increase redundancy, and reduce bandwidth usage.
For more information, see xref:chap-Documentation-Architecture_Guide-Capsule_Server_Overview[].

[[sect-Architecture_Supported_Usage]]
=== Supported Usage

Each {ProjectName} subscription includes one supported instance of Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise{nbsp}Linux{nbsp}Server.
This instance should be reserved solely for the purpose of running  {ProjectName}.
Using the operating system included with {Project} to run other daemons, applications, or services within your environment is not supported.

Support for {ProjectName} components is described below.

SELinux must be either in enforcing or permissive mode, installation with disabled SELinux is not supported.

[[form-Architecture_Supported_Usage-Puppet]]
*Puppet*:: {ProjectName} includes supported Puppet packages.
The installation program allows users to install and configure Puppet servers as a part of {ProjectName} {SmartProxyServer}s.
A Puppet module, running on a Puppet server on the {ProjectName} Server or {Project} {SmartProxyServer}, is also supported by Red{nbsp}Hat.
For information on what versions of Puppet are supported, see the Red{nbsp}Hat Knowledgebase article https://access.redhat.com/articles/1343683[Satellite 6 Component Versions].
+
Red{nbsp}Hat supports many different scripting and other frameworks, including Puppet modules.
Support for these frameworks is based on the Red{nbsp}Hat Knowledgebase article https://access.redhat.com/articles/369183[How does Red{nbsp}Hat support scripting frameworks].


[[form-Architecture_Supported_Usage-Pulp]]
*Pulp*:: Pulp usage is only supported via {ProjectWebUI}, CLI, and API.
Direct modification or interaction with Pulp's local API or database is not supported, as this can cause irreparable damage to the {ProjectName} databases.


[[form-Architecture_Supported_Usage-Foreman]]
*Foreman*:: Foreman can be extended using plug-ins, but only plug-ins packaged with {ProjectName} are supported.
Red{nbsp}Hat does not support plug-ins in the {ProjectName} Optional repository.
+
{ProjectName} also includes components, configuration and functionality to provision and configure operating systems other than {RHEL}.
While these features are included and can be employed, Red{nbsp}Hat supports their usage for {RHEL}.


[[form-Architecture_Supported_Usage-Candlepin]]
*Candlepin*:: The only supported methods of using Candlepin are through the {ProjectWebUI}, CLI, and API.
Red{nbsp}Hat does not support direct interaction with Candlepin, its local API or database, as this can cause irreparable damage to the {ProjectName} databases.


[[form-Architecture_Supported_Usage-Embedded_Tomcat_Application_Server]]
*Embedded Tomcat Application Server*:: The only supported methods of using the embedded Tomcat application server are through the {ProjectWebUI}, API, and database.
Red{nbsp}Hat does not support direct interaction with the embedded Tomcat application server's local API or database.

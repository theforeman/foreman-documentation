== Provisioning Concepts
An important feature of {ProjectName} is unattended provisioning of hosts. To achieve this, {ProjectName} uses DNS and DHCP infrastructures, PXE booting, TFTP, and Kickstart. Use this chapter to understand the working principle of these concepts.

=== PXE Booting
Preboot execution environment (PXE) provides the ability to boot a system over a network. Instead of using local hard drives or a CD-ROM, PXE uses DHCP to provide host with standard information about the network, to discover a TFTP server, and to download a boot image.

For more information about setting up a PXE server see the Red{nbsp}Hat Knowledgebase solution https://access.redhat.com/solutions/163253[How to set-up/configure a PXE Server].

==== PXE Sequence

. The host boots the PXE image if no other bootable image is found.
. A NIC of the host sends a broadcast request to the DHCP server.
. The DHCP server receives the request and sends standard information about the network: IP address, subnet mask, gateway, DNS, the location of a TFTP server, and a boot image.
. The host obtains the boot loader `image/pxelinux.0` and the configuration file `pxelinux.cfg/00:MA:CA:AD:D` from the TFTP server.
. The host configuration specifies the location of a kernel image, `initrd` and Kickstart.
. The host downloads the files and installs the image.

For an example of using PXE Booting by {ProjectServer}, see {BaseURL}provisioning_guide/introduction#Introduction-Defining_the_Provisioning_Workflow[Provisioning Workflow Overview] in the _Provisioning Guide_.

==== Requirements
To provision machines through PXE booting ensure that you meet the following requirements:

.VM requirements:

* Ensure you set up a network connection which has access to the DHCP and TFTP servers.

.Network requirements:

* Ensure the UDP ports 67 and 68 are accessible to enable the VM to receive a DHCP offer with the boot options.

* Ensure the UDP port 69 is accessible so that the VM can access the TFTP server on the {SmartProxy}.

* Ensure the TCP port 80 is accessible to allow the VM to download files and Kickstart templates from the {SmartProxy}.

.Client requirements:

* Configure the DHCP relay agent and point to the DHCP server, if the host and DHCP server are separated by a router.

* Ensure all the network-based firewalls are configured to allow hosts on the subnet to access the {SmartProxy}. For more information, see xref:figu-Satellite_Topology_with_Isolated_Capsule[].

* Ensure the subnet to which the host belongs to is DHCP enabled.

.{Project} requirements:

* Ensure DHCP with the correct subnet is enabled using the {Project} installer.

* Enable TFTP using the {Project} installer.

* The Subnet must be created and associated with a DHCP {SmartProxy} in the web UI to define which {SmartProxy} to use while creating a DHCP reservation. The reservation is always made through a {SmartProxy}.

=== Kickstart
You can use Kickstart to automate the installation process of a {ProjectName} or {SmartProxyServer} by creating a Kickstart file that contains all the information that is required for the installation. For more information about Kickstart, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Installation_Guide/chap-kickstart-installations.html[Kickstart Installations] in the _{RHEL} 7 Installation Guide_.

==== Workflow
When you run a {ProjectName} Kickstart script, the following workflow occurs:

. It specifies the installation location of a {ProjectServer} or a {SmartProxyServer}.
. It installs the predefined packages.
. It installs Red{nbsp}Hat Subscription Manager.
. It uses Activation Keys to subscribe the hosts to {ProjectName}.
. It installs Puppet, and configures a `puppet.conf` file to indicate the {ProjectName} or {SmartProxy} instance.
. It enables Puppet to run and request a certificate.
. It runs user defined snippets.

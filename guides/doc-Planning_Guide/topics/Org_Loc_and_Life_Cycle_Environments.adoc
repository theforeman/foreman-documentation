== Organizations, Locations, and Life Cycle Environments

{ProjectNameX} takes a consolidated approach to Organization and Location management. System administrators define multiple Organizations and multiple Locations in a single {ProjectServer}. For example, a company might have three Organizations (Finance, Marketing, and Sales) across three countries (United States, United Kingdom, and Japan). In this example, the {ProjectServer} manages all Organizations across all geographical Locations, creating nine distinct contexts for managing systems. In addition, users can define specific locations and nest them to create a hierarchy. For example, {Project} administrators might divide the United States into specific cities, such as Boston, Phoenix, or San Francisco.

The {ProjectServer} defines all locations and organizations. Each respective {Project} {SmartProxyServer} synchronizes content and handles configuration of systems in a different location.

The main {ProjectServer} retains the management function, while the content and configuration is synchronized between the main {ProjectServer} and a {Project} {SmartProxyServer} assigned to certain locations.

=== Organizations

Organizations divide {ProjectNameX} resources into logical groups based on ownership, purpose, content, security level, or other divisions. You can create and manage multiple organizations through {ProjectNameX}, then divide and assign your Red Hat subscriptions to each individual organization. This provides a method of managing the content of several individual organizations under one management system.

=== Locations

Locations divide organizations into logical groups based on geographical location. Each location is created and used by a single Red Hat customer account, although each account can manage multiple locations and organizations.

=== Life Cycle Environments

Application life cycles are divided into *life cycle environments* which represent each stage of the application life cycle. Life cycle environments are linked to form an *environment path*. You can promote content along the environment path to the next life cycle environment when required. For example, if development ends on a particular version of an application, you can promote this version to the testing environment and start development on the next version.

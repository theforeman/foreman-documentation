== Common Deployment Scenarios

This section provides a brief overview of common deployment scenarios for {ProjectName}. Note that many variations and combinations of the following layouts are possible.

[[sect-Red_Hat_Satellite-Architecture_Guide-Single_Location]]
=== Single Location

An _integrated {SmartProxy}_ is a virtual {SmartProxyServer} that is created by default in {ProjectServer} during the installation process. This means {ProjectServer} can be used to provision directly connected hosts for {Project} deployment in a single geographical location, therefore only one physical server is needed. The base systems of isolated {SmartProxies} can be directly managed by {ProjectServer}, however it is not recommended to use this layout to manage other hosts in remote locations.

[[sect-Red_Hat_Satellite-Architecture_Guide-Single]]
=== Single Location with Segregated Subnets

Your infrastructure might require multiple isolated subnets even if {ProjectName} is deployed in a single geographic location. This can be achieved for example by deploying multiple {SmartProxyServer}s with DHCP and DNS services, but the recommended way is to create segregated subnets using a single {SmartProxy}. This {SmartProxy} is then used to manage hosts and compute resources in those segregated networks to ensure they only have to access the {SmartProxy} for provisioning, configuration, errata, and general management. For more information on configuring subnets see {ManagingHostsDocURL}[_Managing Hosts_].

[[sect-Red_Hat_Satellite-Architecture_Guide-Multiple_Locations]]
=== Multiple Locations

It is recommended to create at least one {SmartProxyServer} per geographic location. This practice can save bandwidth since hosts obtain content from a local {SmartProxyServer}. Synchronization of content from remote repositories is done only by the {SmartProxy}, not by each host in a location. In addition, this layout makes the provisioning infrastructure more reliable and easier to configure. See xref:figu-{Project_Link}-Architecture_Guide-{Project_Link}_6_System_Architecture-{Project_Link}_6_System_Architecture[] for an illustration of this approach.

[[sect-Red_Hat_Satellite-Architecture_Guide-Disconnected_Satellite]]
=== Disconnected {Project}

In high security environments where hosts are required to function in a closed network disconnected from the Internet, {ProjectName} can provision systems with the latest security updates, errata, packages and other content. In such case, {ProjectServer} does not have direct access to the Internet, but the layout of other infrastructure components is not affected. For information about installing {ProjectServer} from a disconnected network, see link:{BaseURL}installing_satellite_server_from_a_disconnected_network/[Installing {ProjectServer} from a Disconnected Network]. For information about upgrading a disconnected {Project}, see {BaseURL}upgrading_and_updating_red_hat_satellite/upgrading_red_hat_satellite#upgrading_a_disconnected_satellite[Upgrading a Disconnected {ProjectServer}] in _Upgrading and Updating {ProjectName}_.

There are two options for importing content to a disconnected {ProjectServer}:

* *Disconnected {Project} with Content ISO* – in this setup, you download ISO images with content from the Red{nbsp}Hat Customer Portal and extract them to {ProjectServer} or a local web server. The content on {ProjectServer} is then synchronized locally. This allows for complete network isolation of {ProjectServer}, however, the release frequency of content ISO images is around six weeks and not all product content is included. To see the products in your subscription for which content ISO images are available, log on to the Red Hat Customer Portal at https://access.redhat.com, navigate to *Downloads* > *{ProjectName}*, and click *Content ISOs*. For instructions on how to import content ISOs to a disconnected {Project}, see {BaseURL}content_management_guide/configuring-satellite-to-synchronize-content-with-a-local-cdn-server_content-management[Configuring {Project} to Synchronize Content with a Local CDN Server] in the _Content Management Guide_.

* *Disconnected {Project} with Inter-{Project} Synchronization* – in this setup, you install a connected {ProjectServer} and export content from it to populate a disconnected {Project} using some storage device. This allows for exporting both Red{nbsp}Hat provided and custom content at the frequency you choose, but requires deploying an additional server with a separate subscription. For instructions on how to configure Inter-{Project} synchronization, see {BaseURL}content_management_guide/using_iss[Synchronizing Content Between {ProjectServer}s] in the _Content Management Guide_.

The above methods for importing content to a disconnected {ProjectServer} can also be used to speed up the initial population of a connected {Project}.

[[Red_Hat_Satellite-Architecture_Guide-Capsule_with_External_Services]]
=== {SmartProxy} with External Services

You can configure a {SmartProxyServer} (integrated or standalone) to use external DNS, DHCP, or TFTP service. If you already have a server that provides these services in your environment, you can integrate it with your {Project} deployment. For information about how to configure a {SmartProxy} with external services, see {InstallingSmartProxyDocURL}configuring-external-services[Configuring {SmartProxyServer} with External Services] in _{smart-proxy-installation-guide-title}_.

= Compliance Report

A compliance report is the output of a policy run against a host. Each report includes the total number of rules passed or failed per policy. By default, reports are listed in descending date order.

In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Hosts* > *Reports* to list all compliance reports.

A compliance report consists of the following areas:

* Introduction
* Evaluation Characteristics
* Compliance and Scoring
* Rule Overview

.Evaluation Characteristics
The Evaluation Characteristics area provides details about an evaluation against a specific profile, including the host that was evaluated, the profile used in the evaluation, and when the evaluation started and finished. For reference, the IPv4, IPv6, and MAC addresses of the host are also listed.

| Target machine | The fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) of the evaluated host. | `test-system.example.com`
| Benchmark URL | The URL of the SCAP content against which the host was evaluated. | `/var/lib/openscap/content/1fbdc87d24db51ca184419a2b6f`
| Benchmark ID | The identifier of the benchmark against which the host was evaluated. A benchmark is a set of profiles | `xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_benchmark_RHEL_7`
| Profile ID | The identifier of the profile against which the host was evaluated. | `xccdf_org.ssgproject_content_profile_rht-ccp`

.Compliance and Scoring
The Compliance and Scoring area provides an overview of whether or not the host is in compliance with the profile rules, a breakdown of compliance failures by severity, and an overall compliance score as a percentage. If compliance with a rule was not checked, this is categorized in the *Rule results* field as *Other*.

.Rule Overview

The Rule Overview area provides details about every rule and the compliance result, with the rules presented in a hierarchical layout.

Select or clear the check boxes to narrow the list of rules included in the compliance report. For example, if the focus of your review is any non-compliance, clear the *pass* and *informational* check boxes.

To search all rules, enter a criterion in the *Search* field. The search is dynamically applied as you type. The *Search* field only accepts a single plain-text search term and it is applied as a case-insensitive search. When you perform a search, only those rules whose descriptions match the search criterion will be listed. To remove the search filter, delete the search criterion.

For an explanation of each result, hover the cursor over the status shown in the *Result* column.

= Configuring {FreeIPA} Authentication on {ProjectServer}

In the {Project} CLI, configure {FreeIPA} authentication by first creating a host entry on the {FreeIPA} server.

.Procedure

. On the {FreeIPA} server, to authenticate, enter the following command and enter your password when prompted:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# kinit _admin_
----
+
. To verify that you have authenticated, enter the following command:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# klist
----
+
. On the {FreeIPA} server, create a host entry for {ProjectServer} and generate a one-time password, for example:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# ipa host-add --random _hostname_
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The generated one-time password must be used on the client to complete {FreeIPA}-enrollment.

endif::[]

. Create an HTTP service for {ProjectServer}, for example:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# ipa service-add HTTP/_hostname_
----
+
ifndef::orcharhino[]
For more information on managing services, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/linux_domain_identity_authentication_and_policy_guide/services[Managing Services] in the _Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise{nbsp}Linux{nbsp}7 Linux Domain Identity, Authentication, and Policy_ guide.
endif::[]

. On {ProjectServer}, install the IPA client:
ifdef::satellite[]
+
WARNING: This command might restart {Project} services during the installation of the package.
For more information about installing and updating packages on {Project}, see xref:installing-and-updating-packages-on-satellite-server[].
endif::[]
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# {package-install-project} ipa-client
----
+
. On {ProjectServer}, enter the following command as root to configure {FreeIPA}-enrollment:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# ipa-client-install --password _OTP_
----
+
Replace _OTP_ with the one-time password provided by the {FreeIPA} administrator.

. If {ProjectServer} is running on Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise{nbsp}Linux{nbsp}7, execute the following command:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-7-server-optional-rpms
----
+
The installer is dependent on packages which, on Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise{nbsp}Linux{nbsp}7, are in the optional repository `rhel-7-server-optional-rpms`.

. Set `foreman-ipa-authentication` to true, using the following command:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-installer} --foreman-ipa-authentication=true
----

. Restart the `{foreman-maintain}` services:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} service restart
----

External users can now log in to {Project} using their {FreeIPA} credentials.
They can now choose to either log in to {ProjectServer} directly using their username and password or take advantage of the configured Kerberos single sign-on and obtain a ticket on their client machine and be logged in automatically.
The two-factor authentication with one-time password (2FA OTP) is also supported.
If the user in {FreeIPA} is configured for 2FA, and {ProjectServer} is running on Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise{nbsp}Linux{nbsp}7, this user can also authenticate to {Project} with an OTP.

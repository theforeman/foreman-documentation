= Performing an Online Backup

Perform an online backup only for debugging purposes.

.Risks Associated with Online Backups
Data mismatches can occur between Mongo and Postgres databases while the services are online.

When performing an online backup, if there are procedures affecting the Pulp database, the Pulp part of the backup procedure repeats until it is no longer being altered. Because the backup of the Pulp database is the most time consuming part of backing up Satellite, if you make a change that alters the Pulp database during this time, the backup procedure keeps restarting.

For production environments, use the snapshot method. For more information, see xref:performing-a-snapshot-backup_{context}[]. If you want to use the online backup method in production, proceed with caution and ensure that no modifications occur during the backup.


[WARNING]
====
Request other users of Satellite Server or Capsule Server to save any changes and warn them that Satellite services are unavailable for the duration of the backup. Ensure no other tasks are scheduled for the same time as the backup.

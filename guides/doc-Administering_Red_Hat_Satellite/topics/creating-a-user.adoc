.. From the *Authorized by* list, select the source by which the user is authenticated.
- *INTERNAL*: to enable the user to be managed inside {ProjectServer}.
- *LDAP or {FreeIPA}*: to configure external authentication as described in xref:chap-{Project_Link}-Administering_{Project_Link}-Configuring_External_Authentication[].

.. Enter an initial password for the user in the *Password* field and the *Verify* field.

To create a user, enter the following command:

[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# hammer user create \
--login _user_name_ \
--password _user_password_ \
--mail _user_mail_ \
--auth-source-id 1 \
--organization-ids _org_ID1_,_org_ID2_...
----
The `--auth-source-id 1` setting means that the user is authenticated internally, you can specify an external authentication source as an alternative. Add the `--admin` option to grant administrator privileges to the user. Specifying organization IDs is not required, you can modify the user details later using the `update` subcommand.

For more information about user related subcommands, enter `hammer user --help`.

= Security Content Automation Protocol

{ProjectX} uses the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) to define security configuration policies. For example, a security policy might specify that for hosts running Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise{nbsp}Linux, login via SSH is not permitted for the `root` account. With {ProjectX} you can schedule compliance auditing and reporting on all hosts under management. For more information about SCAP, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Security_Guide/[Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Security Guide].

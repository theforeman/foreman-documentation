= Restoring from Incremental Backups

Use this procedure to restore {Project} or {SmartProxyServer} from incremental backups. If you have multiple branches of incremental backups, select your full backup and each incremental backup for the “branch” you want to restore, in chronological order. 

When the restore process completes, all processes are online, and all databases and system configuration revert to the state at the time of the backup.

.Procedure
. Restore the last full backup using the instructions in xref:restoring-from-a-full-backup_{context}[].
. Remove the full backup data from {ProjectServer}’s local file system, for example, `/var/` or `/var/tmp/`.

. Copy the incremental backup data to {ProjectServer}’s local file system, for example, `/var/` or `/var/tmp/`.

. Restore the incremental backups in the same sequence that they are made:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} restore -i _/var/backup_directory_/FIRST_INCREMENTAL
# {foreman-maintain} restore -i _/var/backup_directory_/SECOND_INCREMENTAL
----
+
If you created the backup using the `{foreman-maintain} backup` command, you do not need to use `-i` option in the command.

* For troubleshooting, you can check `/var/log/foreman/production.log` and `/var/log/messages`.

= GSS-Proxy

The traditional process of Kerberos authentication in Apache requires the Apache process to have read access to the keytab file. GSS-Proxy allows you to implement stricter privilege separation for the Apache server by removing access to the keytab file while preserving Kerberos authentication functionality. When using AD as an external authentication source for {Project}, it is recommended to implement GSS-proxy, because the keys in the keytab file are the same as the host keys.

[NOTE]
====
The AD integration requires {ProjectName} Server to be deployed on Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise{nbsp}Linux{nbsp}7.1 or later.

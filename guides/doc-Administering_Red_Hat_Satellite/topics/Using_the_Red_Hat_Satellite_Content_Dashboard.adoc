==== Managing Tasks

{ProjectName} keeps a complete log of all planned or performed tasks, such as repositories synchronised, errata applied, and Content Views published. To review the log, navigate to *Monitor* > *Tasks*.

In the Task window, you can search for specific tasks, view their status, details, and elapsed time since they started. You can also cancel and resume one or more tasks.

The tasks are managed using the Dynflow engine. Remote tasks have a timeout which can be adjusted as needed.

[[proc-Red_Hat_Satellite-Administering_Red_Hat_Satellite-Using_the_Red_Hat_Satellite_Content_Dashboard-Managing_Tasks-To_Adjust_Timeout_Settings]]
.To Adjust Timeout Settings:

. Navigate to *Administer* > *Settings*.
. Enter _%_timeout_ in the search box and click *Search*. The search should return four settings, including a description.
. In the *Value* column, click the icon next to a number to edit it.
. Enter the desired value in seconds, and click *Save*.

[NOTE]
====
Adjusting the _%_finish_timeout_ values might help in case of low bandwidth.
Adjusting the _%_accept_timeout_ values might help in case of high latency.
====

When a task is initialized, any back-end service that will be used in the task, such as Candlepin or Pulp, will be checked for correct functioning. If the check fails, you will receive an error similar to the following one:

[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
There was an issue with the backend service candlepin: Connection refused – connect(2).
----

If the back-end service checking feature turns out to be causing any trouble, it can be disabled as follows.

[[proc-Red_Hat_Satellite-Administering_Red_Hat_Satellite-Using_the_Red_Hat_Satellite_Content_Dashboard-Managing_Tasks-To_Disable_Checking_For_Services]]
.To Disable Checking for Services:

. Navigate to *Administer* > *Settings*.
. Enter _check_services_before_actions_ in the search box and click *Search*.
. In the *Value* column, click the icon to edit the value.
. From the drop-down menu, select *false*.
. Click *Save*.

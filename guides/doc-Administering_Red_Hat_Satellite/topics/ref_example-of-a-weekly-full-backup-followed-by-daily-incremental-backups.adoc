= Example of a Weekly Full Backup Followed by Daily Incremental Backups

The following script performs a full backup on a Sunday followed by incremental backups for each of the following days.
A new subdirectory is created for each day that an incremental backup is performed.
The script requires a daily cron job.

[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
#!/bin/bash -e
PATH=/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
DESTINATION=/var/backup_directory
if [[ $(date +%w) == 0 ]]; then
  {foreman-maintain} backup offline --assumeyes $DESTINATION
else
  LAST=$(ls -td -- $DESTINATION/*/ | head -n 1)
  {foreman-maintain} backup offline --assumeyes --incremental "$LAST" $DESTINATION
fi
exit 0
----

Note that the `{foreman-maintain} backup` command requires `/sbin` and `/usr/sbin` directories to be in `PATH` and the `--assumeyes` option is used to skip the confirmation prompt.

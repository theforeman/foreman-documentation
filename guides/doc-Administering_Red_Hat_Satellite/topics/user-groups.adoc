[id='user-groups_{context}']
= User Groups

With {ProjectName}, you can assign permissions to groups of users. You can also create user groups as collections of other user groups. If using an external authentication source, you can map {Project} user groups to external user groups as described in xref:sect-{Project_Link}-Administering_{Project_Link}-Creating_User_Groups-Configuring_External_User_Groups[].

User groups are defined in an organizational context, meaning that you must select an organization before you can access user groups.

= White-listing and Skipping Steps When Performing Backups

A backup using the `{foreman-maintain} backup` command proceeds in a sequence of steps.
To skip part of the backup add the `--whitelist` option to the command and add the step label that you want to omit.


* To display a list of available step labels, enter the following command:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} advanced procedure run -h
----
+
* To skip a step of the backup, enter the `{foreman-maintain} backup` command with the `--whitelist` option. For example:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} backup online --whitelist backup-metadata  -y _/var/backup_directory_
----

= Creating an Organization Specific Manager Role

Use the {Project} UI to create an administrative role restricted to a single organization named _org-1_.

.Procedure

. Navigate to *Administer* > *Roles*.
. Clone the existing *Organization admin* role. Select *Clone* from the drop-down list next to the *Filters* button. You are then prompted to insert a name for the cloned role, for example _org-1 admin_.
. Click the desired locations and organizations to associate them with the role.
. Click *Submit* to create the role.
. Click _org-1 admin_, and click *Filters* to view all associated filters. The default filters work for most use cases. However, you can optionally click *Edit* to change the properties for each filter. For some filters, you can enable the *Override* option if you want the role to be able to access resources in additional locations and organizations. For example, by selecting the *Domain* resource type, the *Override* option, and then additional locations and organizations using the *Locations* and *Organizations* tabs, you allow this role to access domains in the additional locations and organizations that is not associated with this role. You can also click *New filter* to associate new filters with this role.

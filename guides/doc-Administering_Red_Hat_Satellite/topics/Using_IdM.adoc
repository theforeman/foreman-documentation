=== Using {FreeIPA} 

This section shows how to integrate {ProjectName} Server with a {FreeIPA} server and how to enable host-based access control.

[NOTE]
You can attach {FreeIPA} as an external authentication source with no single sign-on support.
For more information, see xref:sect-{Project_Link}-Administering_{Project_Link}-Using_LDAP[].

.Prerequisites

* {ProjectServer} has to run on Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise{nbsp}Linux{nbsp}7.1 or later.
* The base operating system of {ProjectServer} must be enrolled in the {FreeIPA} domain by the {FreeIPA} administrator of your organization.

The examples in this chapter assume separation between {FreeIPA} and {Project} configuration.
However, if you have administrator privileges for both servers, you can configure {FreeIPA} as described in https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Linux_Domain_Identity_Authentication_and_Policy_Guide/index.html#ldi-install[Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise{nbsp}Linux{nbsp}7 Linux Domain Identity, Authentication, and Policy Guide].

= Compliance Email Notifications

The {ProjectServer} sends an OpenSCAP Summary email to all users who subscribe to the *Openscap policy summary* email notifications. For more information on subscribing to email notifications, see xref:configuring-email-notifications_{context}[]. Each time a policy is run, {Project} checks the results against the previous run, noting any changes between them. The email is sent according to the frequency requested by each subscriber, providing a summary of each policy and its most recent result.

An *OpenSCAP Summary* email message contains the following information:

* Details of the time period it covers.
* Totals for all hosts by status: changed, compliant, and noncompliant.
* A tabular breakdown of each host and the result of its latest policy, including totals of the rules that passed, failed, changed, or where results were unknown.

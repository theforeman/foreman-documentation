== Managing Ansible Roles

In {Project}, you can import Ansible roles to help with automation of routine tasks. Ansible is enabled by default only on {Project}.

[[chap-Red_Hat_Satellite-Administering_Red_Hat_Satellite-Configuring_your_Deployment_to_Run_Ansible_Roles]]
=== Configuring your Deployment to Run Ansible Roles

Complete this procedure to configure your {Project} deployment to run Ansible roles.

.Procedure

. Add the roles to the `/etc/ansible/roles` directory on the {Project} and all {SmartProxies} from where you want to use the roles. If you want to use custom or third party Ansible roles, ensure to configure an external version control system to synchronize roles between {Project} and {SmartProxies}.

. On all {SmartProxies} that you want to use to run Ansible roles on hosts, enable the Ansible plug-in:
+
----
# satellite-installer --scenario capsule \
--enable-foreman-proxy-plugin-ansible true
----

. Distribute SSH keys to enable {SmartProxies} to connect to hosts using SSH. For more information, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_satellite/{ProductVersion}/html-single/managing_hosts/index#sect-Managing_Hosts-Establishing_a_Secure_Connection_for_Remote_Commands[Distributing SSH Keys for Remote Execution] in the _Managing Hosts_ guide. {Project} runs Ansible roles the same way it runs remote execution jobs.

. Import the Ansible roles into {Project}. For more information, see xref:sect-Red_Hat_Satellite-Administering_Red_Hat_Satellite-Importing_Ansible_Roles[].

. Proceed to https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_satellite/{ProductVersion}/html-single/managing_hosts/index#Using_Ansible_Roles[Using Ansible Roles] in the _Managing Hosts_ guide.

[[sect-Red_Hat_Satellite-Administering_Red_Hat_Satellite-Importing_Ansible_Roles]]
=== Importing Ansible Roles

You can import Ansible roles from the `/etc/ansible/roles` directory on {Project} or on a {SmartProxy} that has Ansible enabled. Ensure that the roles that you import are located in the `/etc/ansible/roles` directory on all {SmartProxies} from where you want to use the roles.

To import Ansible roles, complete the following steps:

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Configure* > *Roles* and click the {SmartProxy} that contains the roles that you want to import.
. From the list of Ansible roles, select the check box of the roles you want to import, and then click *Update*.

[[sect-Red_Hat_Satellite-Administering_Red_Hat_Satellite-Importing_Ansible_Variables]]
=== Importing Ansible Variables

Ansible roles use variables to help refine the configuration of systems that have specific requirements. For example, you might need to identify the IP address of a system and use it as a configuration value on another system.

If you want to use Ansible variables in your Ansible playbooks, you must import the Ansible variables from {SmartProxy}.

.Procedure

To import Ansible variables, complete the following steps:

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Configure* > *Variables*.
. In the upper right of the window, select the {SmartProxy} that contains the Ansible variables that you want to import.
. Select the Ansible variables that you want to import, and click *Update*.

[[sect-Red_Hat_Satellite-Administering_Red_Hat_Satellite-Creating_Ansible_Variables]]
=== Creating Ansible Variables

Ansible roles use variables to help refine the configuration of systems that have specific requirements.

Usually, you can import Ansible variables for the Ansible roles that you are using. If you require further refinement of your system configuration, you can also create Ansible variables in {Project}.

.Procedure

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Configure* > *Variables*.
. In the upper right of the window, click *New Ansible Variable*.
. In the *Key* field, enter a name for the variable. Ensure that the name references the Ansible role name.
. In the *Description* field, add a description for the variable.
. From the *Ansible role* list, select the Ansible role to associate with the variable.
. Optional: To override the Ansible variable with {Project}, see the xref:sect-{Project_Link}-Administering_{Project_Link}-Managing_Ansible_Variables_with_Satellite[].
. To save the Ansible variable, click *Submit*.

[[sect-Red_Hat_Satellite-Administering_Red_Hat_Satellite-Managing_Ansible_Variables_with_Satellite]]
=== Overriding Ansible Variables in {Project}

If you run Ansible roles in {Project}, you can use {Project} to override Ansible variables for those roles.

.Precedence in Overriding Variables

If you use an Ansible role to run a task as a user that is not the `Effective User`, there is a strict order of precedence for overriding Ansible variables. To ensure that the variable that you override follows the correct order of precedence, see https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_variables.html#ansible-variable-precedence[Variable precedence: Where should I put a variable?] in the _Ansible User Guide_.

.Prerequisite

You must have Ansible variables in {Project}.

To import Ansible variables, see xref:sect-{Project_Link}-Administering_{Project_Link}-Importing_Ansible_Variables[].

To create Ansible variables, see xref:sect-{Project_Link}-Administering_{Project_Link}-Creating_Ansible_Variables[].

The following procedure makes reference to hosts and host groups. For more information about hosts and host groups, see the {BaseURL}managing_hosts/[Managing Hosts] guide.

.Procedure

To override an Ansible variable, complete the following steps:

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Configure* > *Variables*.
. Select the Ansible variable that you want to override and manage with {Project}.
. Navigate to the *Default Behavior* area, and select the *Override* check box.
. From the *Parameter Type* select the value type for validation. For example, a *string* or *boolean* variable.
. In the *Default Value* field, enter the default value that you want to use if there is no match for the variable.
. Optional: If you do not want to display the Ansible variable in plain text, select the *Hidden Values* check box to display the content of the variable as asterisks in the {Project} web UI.
. To save the override settings, click *Submit*.

To use the Ansible variable, add the variable as a parameter to your host or host group, or add the variable as a global parameter.

.For a Host Group:

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Configure* > *Host Groups*, and select the host group that you want to use.
. Click the *Parameters* tab, and in the *Host Group Parameters* area, click *Add Parameter*.
. In the *Name* field, add the Ansible variable name.
. From the *Type* list, select the type of the variable for validation.
. In the *Value* field, enter the value for the variable.

.For a Host:

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Hosts* > *All Hosts*, and on the host that you want to use, click the *Edit* button.
. Click the *Parameters* tab, and in the *Host Parameters* area, click *Add Parameter*.
. In the *Name* field, add the Ansible variable name.
. From the *Type* list, select the type of the variable for validation.
. In the *Value* field, enter the value for the variable.

.To add as a Global Parameter:

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Configure* > *Global Parameters*, and click *Create Parameter*.
. In the *Name* field, add the Ansible variable name.
. From the *Type* list, select the type of the variable for validation.
. In the *Value* field, enter the value for the variable.
. Optional: If you do not want to display the Ansible variable in plain text, select the *Hidden Values* check box to display the content of the variable as asterisks in the {Project} web UI.

[[sect-Red_Hat_Satellite-Administering_Red_Hat_Satellite-Adding_RHEL_System_Roles]]
=== Adding Red Hat Enterprise Linux System Roles

Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise Linux System Roles is a configuration interface to remotely manage {RHEL} servers. You can use Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise Linux System Roles to add Ansible roles in {Project}. Using Ansible Roles in {Project} can make configuration faster and easier.

Support levels for some of the {RHEL} System Roles might be in Technology Preview. For up-to-date information about support levels and general information about {RHEL} System Roles, see https://access.redhat.com/articles/3050101[Red Hat Enterprise Linux System Roles].

Before subscribing to the Extras channels, see the https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/extras[Red Hat Enterprise Linux Extras Product Life Cycle] article.

.To Add Red Hat Enterprise Linux System Roles:

. Ensure that the `rhel-7-server-extras-rpms` repository is enabled.
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-7-server-extras-rpms
----
+
. Install the `rhel-system-roles` package.
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# {package-install-project} rhel-system-roles
----
+
The `rhel-system-roles` package downloads to `/usr/share/ansible/roles/`. You can view and make any modifications that you want to the files before you import.


. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Configure* > *Roles* and click the {SmartProxy} that contains the roles that you want to import.
. From the list of Ansible roles, select the check box of the roles you want to import, and then click *Update*.

You can now assign Ansible roles to hosts or host groups. For more information, see {BaseURL}managing_hosts/using_ansible_roles#assigning-ansible-roles-to-an-existing-host[Assigning Ansible Roles to an Existing Host] in the _Managing Hosts_ guide.

You can also add the modules contained in these roles to your Ansible playbooks by adding them to Ansible Job Templates. You must include the `hosts:all` line in the job template. For more information, see https://access.redhat.com/articles/3050101[Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) System Roles].

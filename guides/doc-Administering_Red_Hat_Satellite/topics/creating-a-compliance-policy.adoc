= Creating a Compliance Policy

With {ProjectX}, you can create a compliance policy to scan your content hosts to ensure that the hosts remain compliant to your security requirements.

You can use either Puppet or Ansible to deploy the compliance policy to your hosts.
Note that Puppet runs by default every 30 minutes.
If you assign a new policy, the next Puppet run synchronizes the policy to the host.
However Ansible does not perform scheduled runs.
To add a new policy, you must run Ansible role manually or using remote execution.
For more information about remote execution, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_satellite/{ProductVersion}/html-single/managing_hosts/index#configuring-and-setting-up-remote-jobs_managing-hosts[Configuring and Setting up Remote Jobs] in the _Managing Hosts_ guide.

.Prerequisites

Before you begin, you must decide whether you want to use a Puppet or Ansible deployment.

* For Puppet deployment, ensure that each host that you want to audit is associated with a Puppet environment.
For more information, see xref:importing-openscap-puppet-modules_{context}[].
* For Ansible deployment, ensure that you import the `theforeman.foreman_scap_client` Ansible role.
For more information about importing Ansible roles, see {ConfiguringAnsibleDocURL}getting-started-with-ansible_ansible[Getting Started with Ansible in Satellite] in _Configuring Satellite to use Ansible_.

.Procedure

. Navigate to *Hosts* > *Policies*, and select whether you want a manual, Ansible, or Puppet deployment.
. Enter a name for this policy, a description (optional), then click *Next*.
. Select the SCAP Content and XCCDF Profile to be applied, then click *Next*.
+
Until https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1704582[BZ#1704582] is resolved, note that the `Default XCCDF Profile` might return an empty report.
. Specify the scheduled time when the policy is to be applied, then click *Next*.
+
Select *Weekly*, *Monthly*, or *Custom* from the *Period* list.

* If you select *Weekly*, also select the desired day of the week from the *Weekday* list.

* If you select *Monthly*, also specify the desired day of the month in the *Day of month* field.

* If you select *Custom*, enter a valid Cron expression in the *Cron line* field.
+
The *Custom* option allows for greater flexibility in the policy's schedule than either the *Weekly* or *Monthly* options.
. Select the locations to which the policy is to be applied, then click *Next*.
. Select the organizations to which the policy is to be applied, then click *Next*.
. Select the host groups to which the policy is to be applied, then click *Submit*.

When the Puppet agent runs on the hosts which belong to the selected host group, or hosts to which the policy has been applied, the OpenSCAP client will be installed and a Cron job added with the policy's specified schedule.
The `SCAP Content` tab provides the name of the SCAP content file which will be distributed to the directory `/var/lib/openscap/content/` on all target hosts.

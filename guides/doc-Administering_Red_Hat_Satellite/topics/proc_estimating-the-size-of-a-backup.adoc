= Estimating the Size of a Backup

ifeval::["{build}" != "satellite"]
Note that estimations in this section are for the installations that use the Katello plug-in.
endif::[]

The full backup creates uncompressed archives of PostgreSQL and Pulp database files, and {Project} configuration files.
Compression occurs after the archives are created to decrease the time when {Project} services are unavailable.

A full backup requires space to store the following data:

* Uncompressed {Project} database and configuration files
* Compressed {Project} database and configuration files
* An extra 20% of the total estimated space to ensure a reliable backup

.Procedure

. Enter the `du` command to estimate the size of uncompressed directories containing {Project} database and configuration files:
+
----
# du -sh /var/lib/pgsql/data /var/lib/pulp
100G    /var/lib/pgsql/data
100G	/var/lib/pulp
# du -csh /var/lib/qpidd /var/lib/tftpboot /etc /root/ssl-build \
/var/www/html/pub /opt/puppetlabs
886M    /var/lib/qpidd
16M     /var/lib/tftpboot
37M	/etc
900K	/root/ssl-build
100K	/var/www/html/pub
2M	/opt/puppetlabs
942M   total

. Calculate how much space is required to store the compressed data.

The following table describes the compression ratio of all data items included in the backup:

|===
|Data type |Directory |Ratio |Example results

|PostgreSQL database files
|`/var/lib/pgsql/data`
|80 - 85%
|100 GB -> 20 GB

|Pulp RPM files
|`/var/lib/pulp`
|(not compressed)
|100 GB

|Configuration files
a|`/var/lib/qpidd` +
`/var/lib/tftpboot` +
`/etc` +
`/root-ssl/build` +
`/var/www/html/pub` +
`/opt/puppetlabs`
|85%
|942 MB -> 141 MB
|===
+
In this example, the compressed backup data occupies 180 GB in total.

. To calculate the amount of available space you require to store a backup, calculate the sum of the estimated values of compressed and uncompressed backup data, and add an extra 20% to ensure a reliable backup.
+
This example requires 681 GB plus 180 GB for the uncompressed and compressed backup data, 861 GB in total.
With 172 GB of extra space, 1033 GB must be allocated for the backup location.

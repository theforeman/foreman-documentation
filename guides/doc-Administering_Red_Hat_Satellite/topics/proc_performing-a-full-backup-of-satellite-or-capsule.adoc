= Performing a Full Backup of {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer}

{ProjectName} uses the `{foreman-maintain} backup` command to make backups.

There are three main methods of backing up {ProjectServer}:

* Offline backup
* Online backup
* Snapshot backups
+
For more information about each of these methods, you can view the usage statements for each backup method.

For offline backups:

[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} backup offline --help
----

For online backups:

[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} backup online --help
----

For snapshots backups:

[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} backup snapshot --help
----

.Directory creation

The `{foreman-maintain} backup` command creates a time-stamped subdirectory in the backup directory that you specify.
The `{foreman-maintain} backup` command does not overwrite backups, therefore you must select the correct directory or subdirectory when restoring from a backup or an incremental backup.
The `{foreman-maintain} backup` command stops and restarts services as required.

When you run the `{foreman-maintain} backup offline` command, the following default backup directories are created:

* `{project-context}-backup` on {Project}
* `foreman-proxy-backup` on {SmartProxy}

If you want to set a custom directory name, add the  `--preserve-directory` option and add a directory name.
The backup is then stored in the directory you provide in the command line.
If you use the `--preserve-directory` option, no data is removed if the backup fails.

Note that if you use a local PgSQL database, the `postgres` user requires write access to the backup directory.

.Remote databases

You can use the `{foreman-maintain} backup` command to back up remote databases.

You can use both online and offline methods to back up remote databases, but if you use offline methods, such as snapshot, the `{foreman-maintain} backup` command performs a database dump.

.Prerequisites

* Ensure that your backup location has sufficient available disk space to store the backup.

.Procedure
To perform a full offline backup of {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer}, complete one of the following steps:

[WARNING]
====
Request other users of {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer} to save any changes and warn them that {Project} services are unavailable for the duration of the backup.
Ensure no other tasks are scheduled for the same time as the backup.
====

* On {ProjectServer}, enter the following command:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} backup offline _/var/{project-context}-backup_
----

* On {SmartProxyServer}, enter the following command:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} backup offline _/var/foreman-proxy-backup_

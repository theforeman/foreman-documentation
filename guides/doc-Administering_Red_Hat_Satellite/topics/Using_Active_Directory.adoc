=== Using Active Directory

This section shows how to use direct Active Directory (AD) as an external authentication source for {ProjectServer}.

[NOTE]
====
You can attach Active Directory as an external authentication source with no single sign-on support.
For more information, see xref:sect-{Project_Link}-Administering_{Project_Link}-Using_LDAP[].
For an example configuration, see https://access.redhat.com/solutions/1498773[How to configure Active Directory authentication with TLS on {ProjectX}].
====

Direct AD integration means that {ProjectServer} is joined directly to the AD domain where the identity is stored.
The recommended setup consists of two steps: 

* Enrolling {ProjectServer} with the Active Directory server as described in xref:enrolling-satellite-server-with-the-ad-server_{context}[].
* Configuring direct Active Directory integration with GSS-proxy as described in xref:configuring-direct-ad-integration-with-gss-proxy_{context}[].

Perform the following procedures on Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise{nbsp}Linux that acts as a base operating system for your {ProjectServer}.
For the examples in this section _EXAMPLE.ORG_ is the Kerberos realm for the AD domain.
By completing the procedures, users that belong to the EXAMPLE.ORG realm can log in to the {ProjectServer}.

include::active-directory-with-cross-forest-trust.adoc[leveloffset=+3]

From the {Project} point of view, the configuration process is the same as integration with {FreeIPA} server without cross-forest trust configured.
The {ProjectServer} has to be enrolled in the IPM domain and integrated as described in xref:sect-{Project_Link}-Administering_{Project_Link}-Configuring_External_Authentication-Using_Identity_Management[].

.Provisioning Settings Information
|====
|*Setting* |*Description*

|*Type of name generator* |Specifies the method used to generate a host name when creating a new host.

The default `Random-based` option generates a unique random host name which you can but do not have to use. This is useful for users who create many hosts and do not know how to name them.

The `MAC-based` option is for bare-metal hosts only. If you delete a host and create it later on, it receives the same host name based on the MAC address. This can be useful for users who recycle servers and want them to always get the same host name.

The `Off` option disables the name generator function and leaves the host name field blank.
|*Safemode rendering* | Enables safe mode rendering of provisioning templates.
The default and recommended option `Yes` denies the access to variables and any object that is not whitelisted within {Project}.

When set to `No`, any object may be accessed by a user with permission to use templating features, either via editing of templates, parameters or smart variables. This permits users full remote code execution on {ProjectServer}, effectively disabling all authorization. This is not a safe option, especially in bigger companies.
| *Exclude pattern for facts stored in {Project}* | Until https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1759111[BZ#1759111] is resolved, note that if you use the wildcard value, for example `docker*`, to exclude all facts beginning with `docker`, this also excludes facts that contain the excluded term in any part of the name.
| *Ignore interfaces with matching identifier* | Until https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1759111[BZ#1759111] is resolved, note that if you use the wildcard value, for example `docker*`, to ignore all facts beginning with `docker`, this also excludes facts that contain the ignored term in any part of the name.

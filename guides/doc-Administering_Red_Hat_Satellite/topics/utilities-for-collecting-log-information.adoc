There are two utilities available to collect information from log files.

| Command | Description
|`foreman-debug` |The `foreman-debug` command collects configuration and log file data for {ProjectName}, its back-end services, and system information.
This information is collected and written to a tar file.
By default, the output tar file is located at `/tmp/__foreman-debug-xxx.tar.xz__`.

Additionally, the `foreman-debug` command exports tasks run during the last 60 days.
By default, the output tar file is located at `/tmp/__task-export-xxx.tar.xz__`.
If the file is missing, see the file `/tmp/task-export.log` to learn why task export was unsuccessful.

For more information, run `foreman-debug --help`.

There is no timeout when running this command.
|`sosreport` |The `sosreport` command is a tool that collects configuration and diagnostic information from a Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise{nbsp}Linux system, such as the running kernel version, loaded modules, and system and service configuration files.
The command also runs external programs (for example: `foreman-debug -g`) to collect {Project}-specific information, and stores this output in a tar file.

By default, the output tar file is located at `/var/tmp/__sosreport-XXX-20171002230919.tar.xz__`.

For more information, run `sosreport --help` or see https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3592[_What is a sosreport and how can I create one?_].
endif::[]
ifdef::orcharhino[]
For more information, run `sosreport --help`.
endif::[]

The `sosreport` command calls the `foreman-debug -g` and times out after 500 seconds.
If your {ProjectServer} has large log files or many {Project} tasks, support engineers may require the output of `sosreport` and `foreman-debug` when you open a support case.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Both `foreman-debug` and `sosreport` remove security information such as passwords, tokens, and keys while collecting information.
However, the tar files can still contain sensitive information about the {ProjectServer}.
Red{nbsp}Hat recommends that you send this information directly to the intended recipient and not to a public target.

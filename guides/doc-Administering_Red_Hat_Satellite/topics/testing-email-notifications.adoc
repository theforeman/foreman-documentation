= Testing Email Notifications

To verify that users are correctly subscribed to notifications, trigger the notifications manually.

.Procedure

- To trigger the notifications, execute the following command:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# foreman-rake reports:<__frequency__>
----
+
Replace _frequency_ with one of the following:

* daily

* weekly

* monthly

This triggers all notifications scheduled for the specified frequency for all the subscribed users. If every subscribed user receives the notifications, the verification succeeds.   


[NOTE] 
====
Sending manually triggered notifications to individual users is currently not supported.

= Tailoring Files

Tailoring Files allow existing OpenSCAP policies to be customized without forking or rewriting the policy. You can assign a Tailoring File to a policy when creating or updating a policy.

You can create a Tailoring File using the link:https://www.open-scap.org/tools/scap-workbench/[SCAP Workbench]. For more information on using the SCAP Workbench tool, see link:https://www.open-scap.org/resources/documentation/customizing-scap-security-guide-for-your-use-case/[Customizing SCAP Security Guide for your use-case].

= Adding Permissions to a Role

Use this procedure to add permissions to a role.

.Procedure
. Navigate to *Administer* > *Roles*.
. Select *Add Filter* from the drop-down list to the right of the required role.
. Select the *Resource type* from the drop-down list. The _(Miscellaneous)_ group gathers permissions that are not associated with any resource group.
. Click the permissions you want to select from the *Permission* list.
. Depending on the *Resource type* selected, you can select or deselect the *Unlimited* and *Override* check box. The *Unlimited* checkbox is selected by default, which means that the permission is applied on all resources of the selected type. When you disable the *Unlimited* check box, the *Search* field activates. In this field you can specify further filtering with use of the {ProjectNameX} search syntax. See xref:sect-{Project_Link}-Administering_{Project_Link}-Users_and_Roles-Granular_Permission_Filtering[] for details. When you enable the *Override* check box, you can add additional locations and organizations to allow the role to access the resource type in the additional locations and organizations; you can also remove an already associated location and organization from the resource type to restrict access.
. Click *Next*.
. Click *Submit* to save changes.

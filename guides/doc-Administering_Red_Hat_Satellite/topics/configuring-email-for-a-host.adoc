= Changing email notification settings for a host

{Project} can send event notifications for a host to the hostâ€™s registered owner.

You can configure {Project} to send email notifications either to an individual user or a user group. When set to a user group, all group members who are subscribed to the email type receive a message.

To view the notification status for a host, navigate to *Hosts* > *All Hosts* and click the host you want to view.
In the host details page, click the *Additional Information* tab, you can view the email notification status. 

Receiving email notifications for a host can be useful, but also overwhelming if you are expecting to receive frequent errors, for example, because of a known issue or error you are working around.

To change the email notification settings for a host, complete the following steps.

.Procedure

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Hosts* > *All Hosts*, and select the host with the notification setting you want to change.
. Select the host's check box, and from the *Select Action* list, select *Enable Notifications* or *Disable Notifcations*, depending on what you want.

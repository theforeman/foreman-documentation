* Assign an OpenSCAP {SmartProxy}.
* Assign a Puppet environment that contains the Puppet classes to deploy the OpenSCAP policies.
* Assign the `foreman_scap_client` and `foreman_scap_client::params` Puppet classes.

For information about creating and administering hosts, see the {ManagingHostsDocURL}[Managing Hosts] guide.

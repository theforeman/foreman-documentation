== Logging and Reporting Problems

This chapter provides information on how to log and report problems in {ProjectName} Server, including information on relevant log files, how to enable debug logging, how to open a support case and attach the relevant log tar files, and how to access support cases within the {ProjectWebUI}.

You can use the log files and other information described in this chapter to do your own troubleshooting, or you can capture these and many more files, as well as diagnostic and configuration information, to send to Red{nbsp}Hat Support if you need further assistance.

For more information about {Project} logging settings, use `{foreman-installer}` with the `--full-help` option:

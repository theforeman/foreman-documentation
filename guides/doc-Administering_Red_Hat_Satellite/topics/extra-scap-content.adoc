= Extra SCAP Content

You can upload extra SCAP content into the Satellite{nbsp}Server, either content created by yourself or obtained elsewhere. SCAP content must be imported into the Satellite{nbsp}Server before being applied in a policy. For example, the `scap-security-guide` RPM package available in the Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise{nbsp}Linux{nbsp}7.2 repositories includes a profile for the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) version 3. You can upload this content into a Satellite{nbsp}Server even if it is not running Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise{nbsp}Linux{nbsp}7.2 as the content is not specific to an operating system version.

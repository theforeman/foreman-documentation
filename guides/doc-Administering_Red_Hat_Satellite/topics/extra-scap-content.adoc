= Extra SCAP Content

You can upload extra SCAP content into {ProjectServer}, either content created by yourself or obtained elsewhere.
SCAP content must be imported into {ProjectServer} before being applied in a policy.
For example, the `scap-security-guide` RPM package available in the Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise{nbsp}Linux{nbsp}7.2 repositories includes a profile for the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) version 3.
You can upload this content into a {ProjectServer} even if it is not running Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise{nbsp}Linux{nbsp}7.2 as the content is not specific to an operating system version.

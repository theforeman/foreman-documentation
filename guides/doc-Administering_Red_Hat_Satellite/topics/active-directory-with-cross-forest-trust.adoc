= Active Directory with Cross-Forest Trust

Kerberos can create `cross-forest trust` that defines a relationship between two otherwise separate domain forests. A domain forest is a hierarchical structure of domains; both AD and {FreeIPA} constitute a forest. With a trust relationship enabled between AD and {FreeIPA}, users of AD can access Linux hosts and services using a single set of credentials. For more information on cross-forest trusts, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Windows_Integration_Guide/active-directory-trust.html[Creating Cross-forest Trusts with Active Directory and Identity Management] in the _Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise{nbsp}Linux Windows Integration_ guide.

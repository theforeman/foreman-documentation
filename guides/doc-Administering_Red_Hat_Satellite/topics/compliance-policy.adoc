= Compliance Policy

A scheduled audit, also known as a _compliance policy_, is a scheduled task that checks the specified hosts for compliance against an XCCDF profile. The schedule for scans is specified by the {ProjectServer} and the scans are performed on the host. When a scan completes, an _Asset Reporting File_ (ARF) is generated in XML format and uploaded to the {ProjectServer}.
You can see the results of the scan in the compliance policy dashboard. No changes are made to the scanned host by the compliance policy. The SCAP content includes several profiles with associated rules but policies are not included by default.

=== Removed installer duplicate parameters

Both `--foreman-logging-layout` and `--puppet-server-foreman-url` are no longer needed.
The logging layout is now derived from the logging type (`--foreman-logging-type`).
The Foreman URL for puppetserver is now read from the Foreman Proxy setting (`--foreman-proxy-foreman-base-url`).
The parameters still exist and can be specified, but the average user shouldn't need it.

== Upgrade Warnings

=== Foreman Redis caching DB changed to 4

Since Foreman 3.6 Foreman can be easily configured to use Redis for caching (using `--foreman-rails-cache-store type:redis`).
Starting Foreman 3.8 this uses DB 4, instead of DB 0, to avoid potential conflicts with other software.

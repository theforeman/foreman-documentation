== Headline Features

=== All Host index page improvements

The experimental new All Hosts index page gets some major improvements with this release. To use the new page by default, in Settings, set Show new host overview page to Yes.
The legacy All Hosts page and the new All Hosts page now have links to each other, so you can switch between them easily regardless of the setting value.

Host bulk actions - You can now select one or more hosts and click the vertical ellipsis menu to perform the following actions: Build management, Change host group, and Delete

Single-host actions - Additionally, you can click the vertical ellipsis in the rightmost table column (without selecting the host) and perform actions on a single host: Edit, Clone, and Delete

Column selector - You can now click Manage Columns and customize columns displayed in the table. The column options are the same as those on the legacy All Hosts page. Any changes made here will also reflect on the legacy All Hosts page, and vice versa.

=== Puppet 8 support

Foreman 3.12 now fully supports Puppet 8.
While Foreman 3.11 unofficially supported Puppet 8, Puppet's official puppetserver RPMs are known to break on Java.
The installer now handles this for users.
For more information, see #37686[https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/37686].
Users are encouraged to upgrade since Puppet 7 is expected to go end of life in February 2025.

=== Running Foreman on Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal) is deprecated, planned removal in Foreman 3.13

Foreman supports running on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish) since 3.11, therefore running on 20.04 is deprecated.
We plan to drop support for running on 20.04 in Foreman 3.13, so users are encouraged to plan their upgrade.

Note this is for running Foreman itself.
Clients will remain supported.

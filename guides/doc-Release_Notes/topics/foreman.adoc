== Deprecations

=== Preparing {Project} for operation in containerized environments
- *`sendmail` is deprecated for delivering email* - Delivering email by calling the `sendmail` binary on the system is problematic in many cases.
Therefore, it is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
As an alternative, use the SMTP mail delivery method.

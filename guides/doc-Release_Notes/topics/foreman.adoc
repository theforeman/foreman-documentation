GRUB1 template support removed::
Legacy GRUB (GRUB1) templates are no longer supported.
Most distributions switched to GRUB2 by 2014, and maintaining GRUB1 support was causing compatibility issues with newer systems.
Systems still using GRUB1 for provisioning must migrate to GRUB2 before upgrading.

=== Networking & connectivity

SSH certificate support for remote execution::
Smart Proxies can now use SSH certificates signed by a trusted certificate authority (CA) during remote execution connections.
By enabling this feature, you can avoid the default Trust on First Use (TOFU) model, and benefit from centralized trust management and revocation capabilities.

=== Puppet 8 support

Foreman 3.12 now fully supports Puppet 8.
While Foreman 3.11 unofficially supported Puppet 8, Puppet's official puppetserver RPMs are known to break on Java.
The installer now handles this for users.
For more information, see #37686[https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/37686].
Users are encouraged to upgrade since Puppet 7 is expected to go end of life in February 2025.

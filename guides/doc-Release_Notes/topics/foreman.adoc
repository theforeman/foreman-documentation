== Headline Features

=== Greatly decreased JavaScript size for plugins

Previously, Foreman's whole JavaScript bundle was duplicated in every plugin.
Now a separate bundle is generated that Foreman and each plugin can reuse.
In most plugins, we saw a 2 to 3 MB reduction in size.
Depending on the number of plugins, this can save a significant amount in transfer size.
While Foreman does compress and cache these JavaScript bundles, they still had to be loaded all the time.

For more details, see https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/37252 and https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/37391.

=== Running Foreman on {EL} 9 is fully supported

Foreman 3.10 only supported {EL} 9 as experimental, but with this release it is fully supported.

== Upgrade Warnings

=== keycloak-httpd-client-install dropped from {EL} 9

Foreman has shipped its own `keycloak-httpd-client-install` package because initially the version shipped in {EL} 7 was too old to support ODIC.
Recently it was noticed that the version in {EL} 8 contains the required features but still contains a https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-31496[packaging bug].
The version in {EL} 9 contains all the required features but is older than what Foreman has shipped.
Foreman 3.10 was the first release on {EL} 9 and it was marked as experimental.
As a result, the decision has been made to remove it from Foreman's {EL} 9 packaging.
Users who have this package installed should downgrade it using `dnf downgrade keycloak-httpd-client-install`.

For more details, see https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/37334.

=== Running Foreman on {EL} 8 removal in Foreman 3.13

Now that running on {EL} 9 is fully supported, running on {EL} 8 is deprecated.
Foreman 3.13 will drop this support so users are encouraged to plan their upgrade.

Note this is for running Foreman itself.
Clients will remain supported.

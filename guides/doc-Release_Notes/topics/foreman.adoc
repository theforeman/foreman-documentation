[id="foreman-upgrade-warnings"]
== Upgrade warnings

=== RHV/oVirt support removal

*RHV/oVirt Support Completely Removed* - Red Hat Virtualization (RHV) and oVirt compute resource support has been fully removed in {Project} {ProjectVersion}.

* *Previous Deprecation:* Feature was deprecated in {Project} {ProjectVersionPrevious}
* *Impact:* Users with RHV/oVirt compute resources will lose this functionality unless they install the new https://github.com/markt-de/foreman_ovirt[ForemanOvirt plugin]
* *Alternative Solution:* Install the new https://github.com/markt-de/foreman_ovirt[ForemanOvirt plugin] (maintained by a third party) to maintain oVirt functionality. This plugin contains the oVirt functionality that was previously part of Foreman core.
* *Action Required:* If using RHV compute resources, plan migration to alternative platforms or install the https://github.com/markt-de/foreman_ovirt[ForemanOvirt plugin] before upgrading. Users who want to keep oVirt support must install the https://github.com/markt-de/foreman_ovirt[ForemanOvirt plugin] before upgrading. Users who do not want oVirt support are advised to run `foreman-rake ovirt:drop` before upgrading.

[id="foreman-deprecations"]
== Deprecations
=== Preparing {Project} for operation in containerized environments
- *`sendmail` is deprecated for delivering email* - Delivering email by calling the `sendmail` binary on the system is problematic in many cases.
Therefore, it is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
As an alternative, use the SMTP mail delivery method.
For more information, see link:https://docs.theforeman.org/3.16/Installing_Server/index-katello.html#Configuring_Server_for_Outgoing_Emails_foreman[Configuring Foreman server for outgoing emails].

=== UI component phase-outs
- *Legacy AngularJS Pages* - Continued elimination of AngularJS-based UI components as part of All Hosts page redesign

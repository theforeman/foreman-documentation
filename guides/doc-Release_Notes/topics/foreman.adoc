The recurring jobs for the host can also be scheduled from the Ansible tab.

== Upgrade Warnings

=== Running Foreman on Ubuntu 18.04 dropped

Foreman 2.5 introduced support to run on Ubuntu 20.04. Foreman 3.0 deprecated support for running on Ubuntu 18.04 and Foreman 3.1 drops it.
Users are encouraged to upgrade to Ubuntu 20.04 either on Foreman 2.5 or 3.0.

Note that this is only support to run Foreman and Foreman Proxy themselves on Ubuntu 18.04. Managing Ubuntu 18.04 systems remains supported. See https://community.theforeman.org/t/deprecation-plans-for-foreman-on-el7-debian-10-and-ubuntu-18-04/25008[the RFC] for more information.

[id="foreman-deprecations"]
== Deprecations

=== The `:unattended` Setting has been deprecated

Historically Foreman has supported the `:unattended` setting in `settings.yaml`. Setting it to `false` is barely tested and has seen various regressions because of that. This setting will be removed in the future and Foreman will behave as if it's set to `true`.

The host registration feature can be used to register hosts on Foreman for the sole purpose of an inventory. Refer to https://community.theforeman.org/t/rfc-remove-unattended-setting/10035[the removal RFC] for more information.

=== Running Foreman on EL7

Foreman 2.1 introduced EL8 support and Katello 4.0 (on Foreman 2.4) followed.
While it's currently undecided when EL7 support will be dropped exactly, this is an early notice given the considerable number of EL7 deployments.
For fresh installations, EL8 should considered the preferred target.
Existing installations should start thinking about a migration plan.

Note that this is only support to run Foreman and Foreman Proxy themselves on EL7. Managing EL7 systems remains supported. See https://community.theforeman.org/t/deprecation-plans-for-foreman-on-el7-debian-10-and-ubuntu-18-04/25008[the RFC] for more information.

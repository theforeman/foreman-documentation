=== PostgreSQL upgraded to 13 on Enterprise Linux 8

On Enterprise Linux 8 PostgreSQL is upgraded from 12 to 13, to match the version used on Enterprise Linux 9.
Users are required to change the DNF module, but the actual upgrade, including data migration, happens when the installer is executed for the first time.
During the upgrade a backup of the data is created in `/var/lib/pgsql/data-old`.
This backup can be removed once the upgrade is completed.

=== keycloak-httpd-client-install dropped from {EL} 9

Foreman has shipped its own `keycloak-httpd-client-install` package because initially the version shipped in {EL} 7 was too old to support ODIC.
Recently it was noticed that the version in {EL} 8 contains the required features, but still contains a https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-31496[packaging bug].
The version in {EL} 9 contains all the required features, but is older than what Foreman has shipped.
Foreman 3.10 was the first release on {EL} 9 and it was marked as experimental.
Because of that it's been decided to drop it from Foreman's {EL} 9 packaging.
Users who have this package installed should downgrade it using `dnf downgrade keycloak-httpd-client-install`.

For more details, see https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/37334.

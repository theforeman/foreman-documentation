== Upgrade warnings

=== RHV/oVirt support removal

*RHV/oVirt Support Completely Removed* - Red Hat Virtualization (RHV) and oVirt compute resource support has been fully removed in {Project} {ProjectVersion}.

* *Previous Deprecation:* Feature was deprecated in {Project} {ProjectVersionPrevious}
* *Impact:* Users with RHV/oVirt compute resources will lose this functionality unless they install the new ForemanOvirt plugin
* *Alternative Solution:* Install the new ForemanOvirt plugin (maintained by a third party) to maintain oVirt functionality. This plugin contains the oVirt functionality that was previously part of Foreman core.
* *Action Required:* If using RHV compute resources, plan migration to alternative platforms or install the ForemanOvirt plugin before upgrading. Users who want to keep oVirt support must install the ForemanOvirt plugin before upgrading. Users who do not want oVirt support are advised to run `foreman-rake ovirt:drop` before upgrading.

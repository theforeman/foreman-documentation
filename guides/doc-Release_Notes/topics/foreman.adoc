== Upgrade warnings

=== RHV/oVirt support removal

*RHV/oVirt Support Completely Removed* - Red Hat Virtualization (RHV) and oVirt compute resource support has been fully removed in {Project} {ProjectVersion}.

* *Previous Deprecation:* Feature was deprecated in {Project} {ProjectVersionPrevious}
* *Impact:* Users with RHV/oVirt compute resources will lose this functionality unless they install the new https://github.com/markt-de/foreman_ovirt[ForemanOvirt plugin]
* *Alternative Solution:* Install the new https://github.com/markt-de/foreman_ovirt[ForemanOvirt plugin] (maintained by a third party) to maintain oVirt functionality. This plugin contains the oVirt functionality that was previously part of Foreman core.
* *Action Required:* If using RHV compute resources, plan migration to alternative platforms or install the https://github.com/markt-de/foreman_ovirt[ForemanOvirt plugin] before upgrading. Users who want to keep oVirt support must install the https://github.com/markt-de/foreman_ovirt[ForemanOvirt plugin] before upgrading. Users who do not want oVirt support are advised to run `foreman-rake ovirt:drop` before upgrading.

[id="foreman-deprecations"]
== Deprecations

=== UI component phase-outs
- *Legacy AngularJS Pages* - Continued elimination of AngularJS-based UI components as part of All Hosts page redesign

=== Provisioning
* GRUB Legacy, also known as GRUB version 1, is deprecated in provisioning and will be removed in a future release. GRUB 1 was used by end of life distributions such as SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11, RHEL 6, Debian Lenny, and Ubuntu 9.04. Current applications use GRUB 2 and are not affected by the deprecation.

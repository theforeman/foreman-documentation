=== Fedora/Red Hat Atomic is no longer supported

Red Hat Atomic went end of life in 2021 and Fedora Atomic even earlier.
Starting with Foreman 3.9, these will be recognized as regular Fedora or Red Hat.
The installation medium is no longer created, and provisioning templates have dropped support.

=== PostgreSQL upgraded to 13 on Enterprise Linux 8

On Enterprise Linux 8 PostgreSQL is upgraded from 12 to 13, to match the version used on Enterprise Linux 9.
Users are required to change the DNF module, but the actual upgrade, including data migration, happens when the installer is executed for the first time.
During the upgrade a backup of the data is created in `/var/lib/pgsql/data-old`.
This backup can be removed once the upgrade is completed.

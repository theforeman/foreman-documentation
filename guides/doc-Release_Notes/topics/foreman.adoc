== Upgrade Warnings

=== keycloak-httpd-client-install dropped from {EL} 9

Foreman has shipped its own `keycloak-httpd-client-install` package because initially the version shipped in {EL} 7 was too old to support ODIC.
Recently it was noticed that the version in {EL} 8 contains the required features but still contains a https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-31496[packaging bug].
The version in {EL} 9 contains all the required features but is older than what Foreman has shipped.
Foreman 3.10 was the first release on {EL} 9 and it was marked as experimental.
As a result, the decision has been made to remove it from Foreman's {EL} 9 packaging.
Users who have this package installed should downgrade it using `dnf downgrade keycloak-httpd-client-install`.

For more details, see https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/37334.

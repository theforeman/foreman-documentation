== Headline features

=== Pulpcore upgraded to 3.85 and plugins updated
Newer Pulpcore brings bug and performance fixes.
Please see https://pulpproject.org/pulpcore/changes/#3.85.0 for new changes since Pulpcore 3.73.
https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/38748

=== Pulp Resource Name (PRN) migration
In anticipation for a future upgrade to Pulp 4, Katello now indexes PRNs alongside Pulp hrefs.
PRNs will enable more efficient API calls to Pulp in the future.
https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/38809

=== New experimental Container Images page
A new experimental Container Images page will soon replace the older Angular content unit listing page for container image tags.
The new page will eventually merge with the Booted Container Images page.
To view it, enable the "Experimental Labs" setting, refresh the page, and navigate to Lab Features -> Container Images (/labs/container_images).

=== Structured APT for deb content
With Katello 4.19, all deb content will start using "structured APT" mode.
This means that deb content published in APT repos on Katello, will no longer publish Release files u
nder the `dists/default/` path.
Instead, all APT repository publications will exclusively use the same repository structure (releases/distributions and components) as the remote upstream repositories they are synced from.

=== New bulk actions have been added to the host overview page
Change host collection of multiple hosts - https://github.com/Katello/katello/commit/6625fe75ffea36a14666d26d1f8d314851b970a0 - https://github.com/Katello/katello/pull/11528

[id="katello-upgrade-warnings"]
== Upgrade warnings

=== Structured APT migration for deb content
For users with deb type content, it is recommended to migrate to "structured APT" enabled mode *before* upgrading. Instructions for migrating on Katello <= 4.18 can be found here: https://docs.theforeman.org/3.16/Managing_Content/index-katello.html#enabling-structured-apt-content
If you do not migrate your deb content before upgrading, it will be automatically migrated by the foreman-installer run after upgrading.
However, if this automatic migration run is omitted, or fails, some of your deb type content may be left in an inconsistent state.
You will also need to perform a complete sync of your smart proxies after the upgrade.
This is why we recommend migrating before the upgrade, at which point you can easily re-run the migration or get help in case there is an issue.

[id="katello-deprecations"]
== Deprecations

=== The deprecated `auto_attach` and `autoheal` parameters have been removed from all API endpoints.
These options are no longer relevant because all organizations are SCA-only, and attaching subscriptions to hosts and activation keys is obsolete.

=== With the switch to structured APT for deb content, new publications for deb content will no longer add metadata under the `dists/default/` path.
Use the metadata published under the paths used by the remote repository being synced from instead.

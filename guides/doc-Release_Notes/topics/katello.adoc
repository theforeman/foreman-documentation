=== postgresql-evr extension no longer required

Installation of the Katello database on remote systems where root access is not available is now possible.
Only a basic PostgreSQL installation is required, which should enable installs on systems like Amazon RDS or Azure Database for PostgreSQL.
The contents of postgresql-evr have been moved into Katello itself as a migration, which enables this new capability.

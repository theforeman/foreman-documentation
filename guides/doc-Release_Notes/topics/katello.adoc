== Headline Features

=== Syncable format for Inter Server Synchronization
Complete export has been supported for syncable format export. The hammer content-export option is only available for full content exports. But the content data managed by Katello can be measured easily over 100GB even TB which makes it time consuming and not efficient for complete exports every time.

Katello 4.8 adds the ability to perform incremental content exports in syncable format. All three content-export options are available in syncable format.
  `hammer content-export incremental version --format=syncable`
  `hammer content-export incremental library --format=syncable`
  `hammer content-export incremental repository --format=syncable`
The export rpm files are generated as hardlinks to the actual file on disk to avoid the 2X space we may need for regular importable exports.

=== Register hosts to multiple Content Views
Allow hosts to register to multiple content view environments using subscription-manager. A new feature in very early stages and you won't see many changes in the UI yet. It requires subscription-manager 1.29.28 or later on EL8.

The feature is disabled by default. To turn it on, go to Administer > Settings > Content and set "Allow multiple content views" to Yes. For now, the feature will only work with `subscription-manager register` with a username and password. It will not work with activation keys or with global registration.

Run `subscription-manager environments --list` to see available environments. Run `subscription-manager environments --list-enabled` to see environments assigned to the host.

To register a host to multiple environments, run `subscription-manager register --environments <environments>`, replacing `<environments>` with a comma-separated list of environments. You must also use a username and password. Example: `subscription-manager register --environments Library/cv1,dev/cv2 --username xxx --password xx --org Default_Organization`.

The web UI will not reflect that the host is assigned to multiple environments. However, the host details Repository Sets tab will show repositories from the combined environments, even though the banner wording is incorrect. This is expected for now.

If you reassign a host's content view from the web UI, it will no longer be assigned to multiple environments.

Turning off the "Allow multiple content views" setting will not affect hosts that are already registered.

=== Over 70 bug fixes.

=== Flatpak UI

This introduces a new user interface for managing Flatpak remotes and repositories directly within the UI. Users can now create, edit, and scan Flatpak remotes, as well as mirror Flatpak repositories through intuitive visual workflows. This significantly reduces reliance on CLI tools and streamlines the Flatpak content management experience across the organization.

By integrating these capabilities into the UI, administrators gain a more accessible and efficient way to manage Flatpak content, aligning with modern content delivery needs.

=== Certificate authentication for container and flatpak content

Certificate-based authentication is now supported for both container and Flatpak repositories. Hosts can securely consume content using certificates, removing the need for traditional username/password-based login credentials.

This enhancement enables seamless, automation-friendly access to protected content while improving overall security across deployment workflows.

=== New Hosts UI improvements

The redesigned All Hosts page now supports managing content overrides and Repository Sets for multiple hosts at once.

These enhancements further improve usability and scalability when managing large host inventories through the Katello UI.

== Upgrade Warnings

=== New container repository naming standard

An upgrade warning was originally missed in Katello 4.16, so the following is repeated for users who missed it:
New container repositories will have names with slashes '/' in their published paths instead of dashes '-'. 
This is to conform to the latest container image standards.
If the old dash standard is still needed, the Registry Name Pattern can be changed per lifecycle environment.
Updating the Registry Name Pattern will immediately update all container repositories in that lifecycle environment.

== Headline Features

=== Rolling Content Views

Rolling Content Views introduce a new way to access repository content directly from the Library without relying on versions, filters, or publishing workflows. They always point to the latest version of added repositories, making them ideal for environments that require immediate updates without the overhead of content promotion.

This removes the need to subscribe hosts directly to the Library and Default Organization View when only a subset of repositories is needed. Rolling content views can be created and managed via the UI, API, and Hammer CLI, offering flexibility across different workflows.


=== Transient Package Installation on Image Mode Hosts via REX

Package and errata installation is now supported on image mode hosts using Remote Execution, with changes applied as transient updates. These changes remain only until the next reboot, preserving the host's immutable design.

This allows temporary fixes, diagnostics, or runtime testing without altering the base image, making it easier to work with image-based systems while respecting their stateless nature.


=== Container Gateway Support for Load-Balanced setups

The container gateway can now redirect clients to Pulp content using a configurable FQDN, ensuring that traffic is routed through a load balancer instead of the specific host that served the request. This enables consistent and centralized routing across distributed environments.

This ensures clients are redirected to the load balancer instead of the originating host, allowing traffic to reach the correct {SmartProxy} behind the load balancer for container content delivery.

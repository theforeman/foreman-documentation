[id="katello-headline-features"]
== Headline Features

=== Image-mode host support

Katello has added a new type of host: image-mode hosts.
Image-mode hosts are ostree-based atomic systems which have been provisioned with bootable container images (bootc images).
Katello 4.16 enables users to register image-mode hosts, view bootc-related statistics, and remotely execute bootc commands.

Existing hosts are now considered 'package-mode hosts' and will exist alongside the new host type.
Both host types can be set up and configured using existing host management processes.

Bootable container images are OCI compliant images which can be managed using existing container repository management tooling in Katello.
A new 'Booted container images' page displays all bootc images and their respective host counts.
These images are available via API at '/hosts/bootc_images'.


=== Flatpak content support

Katello now supports Flatpak content.
Flatpak content can be manually added as a local repository or can be scanned from external sources and used as a Flatpak remote repository.
After scanning, Flatpak remote repositories can be mirrored to local Katello repositories via remote repository mirroring.
Flatpak repositories can be easily synced and installed on remote hosts via any of Katello's existing repository management techniques.
Flatpak remote repositories are available via API at `/flatpak_remotes`.

Flatpak remote helpers are currently supported through hammer and API; full UI support will be coming soon.
Currently, only OCI Flatpak repositories are supported.


=== 'Sync Dependencies' option for Ansible collection repositories.

Ansible collection repositories now have a new option: 'Sync Dependencies'.
When enabled (default), Pulp will sync the collections given in the requirements file and their dependencies.
When disabled, Pulp will only sync the collections, without their dependencies.


=== Organization custom labels

Organizations now support the ability to use user-submitted labels during creation.
This can help mitigate confusion in cases where default labels result in difficult-to-type or difficult-to-read entries.


=== Allow for non-standard errata types in errata filters

Errata filtering by type now supports an additional 'other' option, letting users filter by errata types which don't match the standard 'Bugfix', 'Enhancement', or 'Security' types.


=== postgresql-evr extension no longer required

Installation of the Katello database on remote systems where root access is not available is now possible.
Only a basic PostgreSQL installation is required.
With this feature, you can now install on systems like Amazon RDS or Azure Database for PostgreSQL.


[id="katello-upgrade-warnings"]
== Upgrade Warnings

=== New container repository naming standard

New container repositories will have names with slashes '/' in their published paths instead of dashes '-'.
This is to conform to the latest container image standards.
If the old dash standard is still needed, the Registry Name Pattern can be changed per lifecycle environment.
Updating the Registry Name Pattern will immediately update all container repositories in that lifecycle environment.

[id="katello-deprecations"]
== Deprecations

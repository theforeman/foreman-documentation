== Headline features

New container images page::
The new Container Images page shows information about synced and booted container images.
For synced images, view and copy pullable paths by content view environments.
See manifests within a manifest list.
Discern between normal, bootable, and flatpak images.
For booted images, see which container images bootc hosts in your environment are running.
https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/38942

Transient packages::
Transient packages are RPMs installed temporarily on bootc machines during runtime.
After rebooting, due to the immutable nature of bootc machines, these RPMs are gone.
These RPMs can be persisted in the bootable container image using the new containerfile install command generator (below).
+
Katello helps track transient packages on the host packages tab of a bootc host.
A new column shows package persistence information: persistent, transient, or unreported (a dash character).
Filter or sort by persistence with new UI dropdowns.
+
NOTE: Transient package data will be available in a future release of subscription-manager.
Until it is shipped, persistence data will be unknown.
https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/38911

Containerfile install command tool::
This new tool allows users to generate a `dnf install` command for all selected transient packages on a bootc host.
Paste this command into your bootable container image's containerfile (and rebuild the image) to persistently install these packages.
+
Supports free selection of RPMs with transient or unreported persistence.
Available through the UI host packages tab, the API, and hammer.

Lifecycle environments for rolling content views::
By default, rolling content views are now created with no lifecycle environment.
Previously, they were assigned to the Library lifecycle environment.
You can assign a lifecycle environment to a rolling content view and use it just like regular content views.
This change should allow rolling content views to be more easily synced to smart proxies, without having to commit the bad practice of assigning the Library lifecycle environment to smart proxies.
https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/38477

Flatpak management improvements::
Added an informational alert in the Create Flatpak Remote modal that guides users through Red Hat flatpak remote setup.
Features one-click URL population and a direct link to credential generation.
+
Added dependency detection and warnings for flatpak applications.
Shows dependency alerts during mirror repository operations and displays warnings during Content View publishing when flatpak apps are included but required runtimes may not be available.
+
Fixed container registry authentication to properly scope content access.
Unregistered hosts see all unauthorized content, basic auth shows user content plus unauthorized content, and certificate auth properly limits content to the host's content view environments only.
https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/38810

Multiple content view environments improvements::
MultiCV is now enabled by default.
You do not need to change a Setting in order to assign multiple content view environments.
+
--
In addition to viewing multiple content view environment assignments, you can now assign and reorder multiple content view environments in the web UI:

* To an activation key via the Activation Key create and details pages
* To a single host via the host details page
* To multiple hosts via Hosts > All Hosts > kebab menu bulk action
--
+

System Purpose and Release Version added to Host bulk actions.
You can now edit System Purpose attributes and release version for multiple hosts on the All Hosts page.
https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/38881
+
Manage Traces added to Host bulk actions.
You can now resolve Traces on multiple hosts on the All Hosts page.
https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/38876
+
CSV Export.
You can now export the All Hosts table to CSV in the new UI.
https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/38940

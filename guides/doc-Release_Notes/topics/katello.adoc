== Headline Features

For the full list of changes, see the https://github.com/Katello/katello/blob/KATELLO-{KatelloVersion}/CHANGELOG.md[Changelog].

* The repository indexing code has been rewritten and is now much faster. A 6x indexing speed improvement for the RHEL 7 RPMs repository was reported on the pull request.
* Docker repositories can now use the "On Demand" download policy.
* Docker repositories can now have tags both limited and included at sync time, as opposed to only included.
  - Source container images are now excluded by default, but that may be changed by editing the "exclude tags".
* When syncing Debian content to smart proxies, the "APT Verbatim" publisher is used in Pulp for more efficient metadata mirroring.
* A sync download rate limit setting has been introduced under the "Content" tab.
* Content view versions may now be removed from a content view in bulk.
* Work on the new host details page has progressed, specifically the packages and errata overview pages:
  - An Installable Errata card has been added to the overview, with links to pre-filtered errata views on the Errata tab.
  - The Packages tab now offers filter dropdowns for up-to-date / upgradable status.
* The Inter-Server Sync interface (in Content > Subscriptions > Manage Manifest) has been rewritten completely, featuring a new CDN Configuration tab with three clear options for where Katello gets its content.
  - As part of the above, the 'content_disconnected' setting has been renamed to 'subscription_connection_enabled'.
* The Red Hat repositories page no longer contacts the CDN when in Airgapped mode.
* Fixed errata installation raising errors when using Remote Execution.
* Numerous improvements to Content View exporting and importing have been included.

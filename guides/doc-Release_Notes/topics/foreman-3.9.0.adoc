= Foreman 3.9.0

A full list of changes is available on https://projects.theforeman.org/issues?set_filter=1&sort=id%3Adesc&status_id=closed&f%5B%5D=cf_12&op%5Bcf_12%5D=%3D&v%5Bcf_12%5D%5B%5D=1765[Redmine]

== Headline Features

=== New All Hosts page features

The All Hosts page has been revamped to include features like Host Create and Register buttons, bulk host deletion, and faster links to each host. Users will now have the ability to do many CRUD tasks from the All Hosts page instead of having to go to other pages.

=== Redis is the default cache type

Default installations will now use Redis configured as the default cache type. Using Redis as the cache has proven to be better performant and does not result in file locking or cache misses.

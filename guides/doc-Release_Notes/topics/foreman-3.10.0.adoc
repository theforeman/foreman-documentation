A full list of changes is available on https://projects.theforeman.org/issues?set_filter=1&sort=id%3Adesc&status_id=closed&f%5B%5D=cf_12&op%5Bcf_12%5D=%3D&v%5Bcf_12%5D%5B%5D=1789[Redmine]

== Headline Features

=== Experimental {EL} 9 support

This is the first release to provide {EL} 9 packages.
{EL} 9 comes with Ruby 3 and it may affect your templates.
Right now there's no guidance on upgrading.
Because of this it's considered experimental.
Foreman 3.11 plans to provide this.
Users are encouraged to test and provide feedback.

=== foreman-debug is now an optional package

The foreman-debug package is no longer installed by default, and it is now required to be installed separately.

== Deprecations

=== `foreman-maintain backup snapshot`

`foreman-maintain backup snapshot` is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
Please use other backup types to replace your use of snapshot.

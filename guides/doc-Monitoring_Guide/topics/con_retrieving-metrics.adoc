= Retrieving Metrics

You can retrieve metrics from PCP using the CLI or the web UI interfaces. A number of CLI tools are provided with PCP, which can either output live data, or data from archived sources. The web UI interfaces are provided by the Grafana and Vector web applications. Vector connects directly to the PCP daemon, and can only display live data. Grafana reads from PCP archive files and can display data to up to 1 year old.

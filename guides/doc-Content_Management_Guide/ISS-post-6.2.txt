This is a rough list of what's planned for ISS 6.2+

////
Won't do

This is mainly for info. We're not going to specifically create a list of things we can't do and deliver it. The most we'd do is highlight what's not supported *yet* cp. to what *IS* supported.

* support import into anything except Library.
** Convert this into a positive statement, such as "Satellite supports importing $objects into the Library environment of a downstream Satellite."
* import/export of ostree/docker
* Incremental export/import of anything except rpm & errata
* Import/export of provisioning (kickstart) templates
* Import/export of host groups
* Exporting kickstart trees
* providing automatic way to share exported data from the upstream server to downstream
* providing automatic way to clean up disk space in export location
////


////
This is not in 6.2

==== Exporting hammer Export Files

* export 'hammer csv' to recreate Content View version on import.
** isn't the result of `hammer export csv` or whatever just a file that you can import? Is there more required to maintain the CVV?
* export 'hammer csv' to recreate life cycle environments on import.
* export 'hammer csv' to recreate products on import (enable Red Hat repos, create custom products).
////


////
Not in 6.2

* Export Puppet
** do  you export Puppet or Puppet content or Puppet-* ?
////

////
There's no indication that this is in 6.2 either

==== Customizing Content View Versions (CVVs)

(developers)

* customize a Content View version's version (ie. create a CVV 20.1).

=== Importing Content

The second method can be used for connected Satellite Servers that have access to the upstream Satellite. This method requires making the export available via HTTP to the downstream Satellite instance. The export is placed in the `/var/www/pub/export` directory, and the CDN location on the manifest import page is set to `http://localhost/export/path/to/export`. The Red{nbsp}Hat Repositories page then works normally, using your exported data.

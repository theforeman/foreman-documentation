= Managing Container Name Patterns

When you use Satellite to create and manage your containers, as the container moves through Content View versions and different stages of the Satellite lifecycle environment, the container name changes at each stage. For example, if you synchronize a container image with the name `ssh` from an upstream repository, when you add it to a Satellite product and organization and then publish as part of a Content View, the container image can have the following name: `my_organization_production-custom_spin-my_product-custom_ssh`. This can create problems when you want to pull a container image because container registries can contain only one instance of a container name. To avoid problems with Satellite naming conventions, you can set a registry name pattern to override the default name to ensure that your container name is clear for future use.

.Limitations

If you use a registry name pattern to manage container naming conventions, because registry naming patterns must generate globally unique names, you might experience naming conflict problems. For example:

* If you set the `repository.docker_upstream_name` registry name pattern, you cannot publish or promote Content Views with container content with identical repository names to the `Production` lifecycle.
* If you set the `lifecycle_environment.name` registry name pattern, this can prevent the creation of a second container repository with the identical name.

You must proceed with caution when defining registry naming patterns for your containers.

.Procedure

To manage container naming with a registry name pattern, complete the following steps:

. In the Satellite web UI, navigate to *Content* > *Lifecycle Environments*, and either create a lifecycle environment or select a lifecycle environment to edit.
. In the *Container Image Registry* area, click the edit icon to the right of *Registry Name Pattern* area.
. Use the list of variables and examples to determine which registry name pattern you require.
. In the *Registry Name Pattern* field, enter the registry name pattern that you want to use. For example, to use the `repository.docker_upstream_name`:
+
----
<%= repository.docker_upstream_name %>
----
+
. Click *Save*.

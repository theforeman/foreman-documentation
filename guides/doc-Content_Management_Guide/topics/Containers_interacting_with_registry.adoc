= Using Container Registries

Podman and Docker can be used to fetch content from container registries.

.Container Registries on {SmartProxies}

On {SmartProxies} with content, the https://github.com/Katello/smart_proxy_container_gateway[Container Gateway] {SmartProxy} plugin acts as the container registry.
It caches authentication information from Katello and proxies incoming requests to Pulp.
The Container Gateway is available by default on {SmartProxies} with content.

.Procedure

Logging in to the container registry:
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# podman login {foreman-example-com}
----

Listing container images:
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# podman search {foreman-example-com}/
----

Pulling container images:
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# podman pull {foreman-example-com}/my-image:<optional_tag>
----

.Limitations

With the Katello 4.0 release, the Container Gateway does not support pulling container images that require authentication.
Until it does, ensure that *Unauthenticated Pull* is checked for all Lifecycle Environments that have container repositories that are expected to be served by {SmartProxies}.

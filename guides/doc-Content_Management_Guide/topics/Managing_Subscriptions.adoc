[[Managing_Subscriptions]]
== Managing Subscriptions

{ProjectNameX} can import content from the Red Hat Content Delivery Network (CDN).
{ProjectX} requires a Subscription Manifest to find, access, and download content from the corresponding repositories.
You must have a Subscription Manifest containing a subscription allocation for each organization on {ProjectServer}.
All subscription information is available in your Red Hat Customer Portal account.

Before you can complete the tasks in this chapter, you must create a Subscription Manifest in the Customer Portal.

To create, manage, and export a Subscription Manifest in the Customer Portal, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_subscription_management/1/html/using_red_hat_subscription_management/using_manifests_con[Using Manifests] in the _Using Red Hat Subscription Management_ guide.

Use this chapter to import a Subscription Manifest and manage the manifest within the {Project} web UI.

.Subscription Allocations and Organizations

You can manage more than one organization if you have more than one subscription allocation.
{ProjectX} requires a single allocation for each organization configured in {ProjectServer}.
The advantage of this is that each organization maintains separate subscriptions so that you can support multiple organizations, each with their own Red Hat accounts.

.Future-Dated subscriptions

You can use future-dated subscriptions in a subscription allocation.
When you add future-dated subscriptions to content hosts before the expiry date of the existing subscriptions, you can have uninterrupted access to repositories.

Manually attach the future-dated subscriptions to your content hosts before the current subscriptions expire.
Do not rely on the auto-attach method because this method is designed for a different purpose and might not work.
For more information, see xref:Managing_Subscriptions-Attaching_Subscriptions[].

You can now enable repositories and import Red Hat content.
For more information, see xref:Importing_Content[].

[[Managing_Subscriptions-Locating_a_Manifest]]
=== Locating a Subscription in the {Project} Web UI

When you import a Subscription Manifest into {ProjectServer}, the subscriptions from your manifest are listed in the Subscriptions window.
If you have a high volume of subscriptions, you can filter the results to find a specific subscription.

.Prerequisite

You must have a Subscription Manifest file imported to {ProjectServer}.
For more information, see xref:importing-a-subscription-manifest-into-satellite-server_content-management[].

.Procedure

To locate a subscription, complete the following steps:

. In the {Project} web UI, ensure the context is set to the organization you want to use.
. Navigate to *Content* > *Subscriptions*.
. In the Subscriptions window, click the *Search* field to view the list of search criteria for building your search query.
. Select search criteria to display further options.
. When you have built your search query, click the search icon.

For example, if you place your cursor in the *Search* field and select *expires*, then press the space bar, another list appears with the options of placing a *>*, *<*, or *=* character.
If you select *>* and press the space bar, another list of automatic options appears.
You can also enter your own criteria.

Manifests must not be deleted.
If you delete the manifest from the Red Hat Customer Portal or in the {Project} web UI, all of the entitlements for all of your content hosts will be removed.
====

.Prerequisite

You must have a Subscription Manifest file imported to {ProjectServer}.
For more information, see xref:importing-a-subscription-manifest-into-satellite-server_content-management[].

.Procedure

[[Managing_Subscriptions-Updating_a_Manifest]]
=== Updating and Refreshing Subscription Manifests

Every time that you change a subscription allocation, you must refresh the manifest to reflect these changes.
For example, you must refresh the manifest if you take any of the following actions:

* Renewing a subscription
* Adjusting subscription quantities
* Purchasing additional subscriptions

You can refresh the manifest directly in the {Project} web UI.
Alternatively, you can import an updated manifest that contains the changes.

.Procedure

. In the {Project} web UI, ensure the context is set to the organization you want to use.
. Navigate to *Content* > *Subscriptions*.
. In the Subscriptions window, click *Manage Manifest*.
. In the Manage Manifest window, click *Refresh*.

[[Managing_Subscriptions-Attaching_Subscriptions]]
=== Attaching Subscriptions to Content Hosts

Using activation keys is the main method to attach subscriptions to content hosts during the provisioning process.
However, an activation key cannot update an existing host.
If you need to attach new or additional subscriptions, such as future-dated subscriptions, to one host, use the following procedure.

For more information about updating multiple hosts, see xref:Bulk_Updating_Content_Hosts_Subscriptions[].

For more information about activation keys, see xref:Managing_Activation_Keys[].

.{Project} Subscriptions

In {Project}, you must maintain a {RHEL} {Project} subscription, formerly known as {RHEL} Smart Management, for every {RHEL} host that you want to manage.

However, you are not required to attach {Project} subscriptions to each content host.
{Project} subscriptions cannot attach automatically to content hosts in {Project} because they are not associated with any product certificates.
Adding a {Project} subscription to a content host does not provide any content or repository access.
If you want, you can add a {Project} subscription to a manifest for your own recording or tracking purposes.

.Prerequisite

You must have a Subscription Manifest file imported to {ProjectServer}.

.Procedure

. In the {Project} web UI, ensure the context is set to the organization you want to use.
. Navigate to *Hosts* > *Content Hosts*.
. On the row of each content host whose subscription you want to change, select the corresponding check box.
. From the *Select Action* list, select *Manage Subscriptions*.
. Optionally, enter a key and value in the *Search* field to filter the subscriptions displayed.
. Select the check box to the left of the subscriptions that you want to add or remove and click *Add Selected* or *Remove Selected* as required.
. Click *Done* to save the changes.

.CLI procedure

. Connect to {ProjectServer} as the root user, and then list the available subscriptions:
+
[subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer subscription list \
--organization-id 1
----
+
. Attach a subscription to the host:
+
[subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer host subscription attach \
--host _host_name_ \
--subscription-id _subscription_id_
----

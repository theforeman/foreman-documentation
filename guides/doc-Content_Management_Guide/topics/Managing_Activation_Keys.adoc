[[Managing_Activation_Keys]]
== Managing Activation Keys

Activation keys provide a method to automate system registration and subscription attachment. You can create multiple keys and associate them with different environments and Content Views. For example, you might create a basic activation key with a subscription for Red Hat Enterprise Linux workstations and associate it with Content Views from a particular environment.

You can use activation keys during content host registration to improve the speed, simplicity and consistency of the process. Note that activation keys are used only when hosts are registered. If changes are made to an activation key, it is applicable only to hosts that are registered with the amended activation key in the future. The changes are not made to existing hosts.

Activation keys can define the following properties for content hosts:

* Associated subscriptions and subscription attachment behavior
* Available products and repositories
* A life cycle environment and a Content View
* Host collection membership
* System purpose

.Content View Conflicts between Host Creation and Registration

When you provision a host, {Project} uses provisioning templates and other content from the Content View that you set in the host group or host settings. When the host is registered, the Content View from the activation key overwrites the original Content View from the host group or host settings. Then {Project} uses the Content View from the activation key for every future task, for example, rebuilding a host.

When you rebuild a host, ensure that you set the Content View that you want to use in the activation key and not in the host group or host settings.

.Using the Same Activation Key with Multiple Content Hosts
You can apply the same activation key to multiple content hosts if it contains enough subscriptions. However, activation keys set only the initial configuration for a content host. When the content host is registered to an organization, the organization's content can be attached to the content host manually.

.Using Multiple Activation Keys with a Content Host
A content host can be associated with multiple activation keys that are combined to define the host settings. In case of conflicting settings, the last specified activation key takes precedence. You can specify the order of precedence by setting a host group parameter as follows:

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
$ hammer hostgroup set-parameter \
--name kt_activation_keys \
--value _name_of_first_key_, _name_of_second_key_,... \
--hostgroup _hostgroup_name_
----

[[Managing_Activation_Keys-Creating_an_Activation_Key]]
=== Creating an Activation Key

You can use activation keys to define a specific set of subscriptions to attach to hosts during registration. The subscriptions that you add to an activation key must be available within the associated Content View.

Subscription Manager attaches subscriptions differently depending on the following factors:

* Are there any subscriptions associated with the activation key?
* Is the auto-attach option enabled?
* For Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise Linux 8 hosts: Is there system purpose set on the activation key?

Note that {Project} automatically attaches subscriptions only for the products installed on a host. For subscriptions that do not list products installed on Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise Linux by default, such as the Extended Update Support (EUS) subscription, use an activation key specifying the required subscriptions and with the auto-attach disabled.

Based on the previous factors, there are three possible scenarios for subscribing with activation keys:

. Activation key that attaches subscriptions automatically.
+
With no subscriptions specified and auto-attach enabled, hosts using the activation key search for the best fitting subscription from the ones provided by the Content View associated with the activation key. This is similar to entering the `subscription-manager --auto-attach` command. For Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise Linux 8 hosts, you can configure the activation key to set system purpose on hosts during registration to enhance the automatic subscriptions attachment.
+
. Activation key providing a custom set of subscription for auto-attach.
+
If there are subscriptions specified and auto-attach is enabled, hosts using the activation key select the best fitting subscription from the list specified in the activation key. Setting system purpose on the activation key does not affect this scenario.
+
. Activation key with the exact set of subscriptions.
+
If there are subscriptions specified and auto-attach is disabled, hosts using the activation key are associated with all subscriptions specified in the activation key. Setting system purpose on the activation key does not affect this scenario.

.Custom Products
If a custom product, typically containing content not provided by Red Hat, is assigned to an activation key, this product is always enabled for the registered content host regardless of the auto-attach setting.

.Procedure

To create an activation key, complete the following steps:

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Content* > *Activation keys* and click *Create Activation Key*.
. In the *Name* field, enter the name of the activation key.
. If you want to set a limit, clear the *Unlimited hosts* check box, and in the *Limit* field, enter the maximum number of systems you can register with the activation key. If you want unlimited hosts to register with the activation key, ensure the *Unlimited Hosts* check box is selected.
. In the *Description* field, enter a description for the activation key.
. From the *Environment* list, select the environment to use.
. From the *Content View* list, select a Content View to use. If you want to use this activation key to register hosts, the Content View must contain the `{RepoRHEL7ServerSatelliteToolsProductVersion}` repository because it is required to install the `katello-agent`.
. Click *Save*.
. Optional: For Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise Linux 8 hosts, in the *System Purpose* section, you can configure the activation key with system purpose to set on hosts during registration to enhance subscriptions auto attachment.

.For CLI Users

. Create the activation key:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer activation-key create \
--name "_My_Activation_Key_" \
--unlimited-hosts \
--description "_Example Stack in the Development Environment_" \
--lifecycle-environment "_Development_" \
--content-view "_Stack_" \

[[Managing_Activation_Keys-Using_Activation_Keys]]
=== Using Activation Keys for Host Registration

You can use activation keys to complete the following tasks:

  * Registering new hosts during provisioning through {ProjectNameX}. The kickstart provisioning templates in {ProjectNameX} contain commands to register the host using an activation key that is defined when creating a host.
  * Registering existing Red Hat Enterprise Linux hosts. Configure Red Hat Subscription Manager to use {ProjectServer} for registration and specify the activation key when running the `subscription-manager register` command.

.Procedure

To use an activation key for host registration with an existing Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 host to {ProjectServer}, complete the following steps:

. Download the consumer RPM for your {ProjectServer}. This is located in the `pub` directory on the host's web server. For example, for a {ProjectServer} with the host name `{foreman-example-com}`, enter the following command on the host to register:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# rpm -Uvh _http://{foreman-example-com}_/pub/katello-ca-consumer-latest.noarch.rpm
----
+
This RPM installs the necessary certificates for accessing repositories on {ProjectServer} and configures Red Hat Subscription Manager to use the server's URL.
+
. On the host, enter the following command to register the host to {Project} using the activation key:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# subscription-manager register --activationkey="_My_Activation_Key_" \
--org="_My_Organization_"
----
+
. To view a list of hosts for an organization, on {ProjectServer}, enter the following command:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer host list --organization "_My_Organization_"
----
+
. After registering a host to {ProjectServer}, install the `katello-agent` package on the host so that it can report back to {ProjectServer}:
+
----
# yum install katello-agent
----
+
The `{RepoRHEL7ServerSatelliteToolsProductVersion}` repository provides this package.

.Multiple Activation Keys

You can use multiple activation keys when registering a content host. You can then create activation keys for specific subscription sets and combine them according to content host requirements. For example, the following command registers a content host to your organization with both VDC and OpenShift subscriptions:

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# subscription-manager register --org="_My_Organization_" \
--activationkey="ak-VDC,ak-OpenShift"
----


.Settings Conflicts
If there are conflicting settings in activation keys, the rightmost key takes precedence.

* Settings that conflict: *Service Level*, *Release Version*, *Environment*, *Content View*, and *Product Content*.
* Settings that do not conflict and the host gets the union of them: *Subscriptions* and *Host Collections*.
* Settings that influence the behavior of the key itself and not the host configuration: *Content Host Limit* and *Auto-Attach*.

[[Managing_Activation_Keys-Enabling_Auto_Attach]]
=== Enabling Auto-Attach

When auto-attach is enabled on an activation key and there are subscriptions associated with the key, the subscription management service selects and attaches the best-matched associated subscriptions based on a set of criteria like currently installed products, architecture, and preferences like service level.

You can enable auto-attach and have no subscriptions associated with the key. This type of key is commonly used to register virtual machines when you do not want the virtual machine to consume a physical subscription, but to inherit a host-based subscription from the hypervisor. For more information, see {BaseURL}configuring_virtual_machine_subscriptions_in_red_hat_satellite/index[_Configuring Virtual Machine Subscriptions in {ProjectName}_].

Auto-attach is enabled by default. Disable the option if you want to force attach all subscriptions associated with the activation key.

.Procedure

To enable auto-attach, complete the following steps:

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Content* > *Activation Keys*.
. Click the activation key name that you want to edit.
. Click the *Subscriptions* tab.
. Click the edit icon next to *Auto-Attach*.
. Select or clear the check box to enable or disable auto-attach.
. Click *Save*.

.For CLI Users

To enable auto-attach on the activation key:

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer activation-key update --name "_My_Activation_Key_" \
--organization "_My_Organization_" --auto-attach true
----

[[Managing_Activation_Keys-Setting_the_Service_Level]]
=== Setting the Service Level

You can configure an activation key to define a default service level for the new host created with the activation key. Setting a default service level selects only the matching subscriptions to be attached to the host. For example, if the default service level on an activation key is set to Premium, only subscriptions with premium service levels are attached to the host upon registration.

.Procedure

To set the service level, complete the following steps:

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Content* > *Activation Keys*.
. Click the activation key name you want to edit.
. Click the edit icon next to *Service Level*.
. Select the required service level from the list. The list only contains service levels available to the activation key.
. Click *Save*.

.For CLI Users

To set a default service level to Premium on the activation key:

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer activation-key update --name "_My_Activation_Key_" \
--organization "_My_Organization_" --service-level premium
----

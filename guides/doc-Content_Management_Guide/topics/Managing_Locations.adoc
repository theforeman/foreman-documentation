[[Managing_Locations]]
== Managing Locations

Locations function similar to organizations: they provide a method to group resources and assign hosts.
Organizations and locations have the following conceptual differences:

* Locations are based on physical or geographical settings.
* Locations have a hierarchical structure.

[[Managing_Locations-Creating_a_Location]]
=== Creating a Location

Use this procedure to create a location so that you can manage your hosts and resources by location.
To use the CLI instead of the web UI, see the xref:cli-creating-a-location_{context}[].

.Procedure

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Administer > Locations*.
. Click *New Location*.
. Optional: from the *Parent* list, select a parent location.
This creates a location hierarchy.
. In the *Name* field, enter a name for the location.
. Optional: in the *Description* field, enter a description for the location.
. Click *Submit*.
. If you have hosts with no location assigned, add any hosts that you want to assign to the new location, then click *Proceed to Edit*.
. Assign any infrastructure resources that you want to add to the location.
This includes networking resources, installation media, kickstart templates, and other parameters.
You can return to this page at any time by navigating to *Administer* > *Locations* and then selecting a location to edit.
. Click *Submit* to save your changes.

[[Managing_Locations-Creating_Multiple_Locations]]
=== Creating Multiple Locations

The following example Bash script creates three locations - London, Munich, Boston - and assigns them to the Example Organization.
[source, Bash, subs="+quotes"]
----
ORG="_Example Organization_"
LOCATIONS="_London Munich Boston_"

for LOC in ${LOCATIONS}
do
  hammer location create --name "${LOC}"
  hammer location add-organization --name "${LOC}" --organization "${ORG}"
done

[[Managing_Locations-Setting_the_Location_Context]]
=== Setting the Location Context

A location context defines the location to use for a host and its associated resources.

.Procedure

The location menu is the second menu item in the menu bar, on the upper left of the {Project} web UI.
If you have not selected a current location, the menu displays *Any Location*.
Click *Any location* and select the location to use.

.CLI procedure

While using the CLI, include either `--location "_your_location_name_"` or `--location-id "_your_location_id_"` as an option.
For example:

[subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer subscription list --location "Default_Location"
----

This command outputs subscriptions allocated for the _Default_Location_.

[[Managing_Locations-Deleting_a_Location]]
=== Deleting a Location

You can delete a location if the location is not associated with any life cycle environments or host groups.
If there are any life cycle environments or host groups associated with the location you are about to delete, remove them by navigating to *Administer* > *Locations* and clicking the relevant location.
Do not delete the default location created during installation because the default location is a placeholder for any unassociated hosts in the {Project} environment.
There must be at least one location in the environment at any given time.

.Procedure

To delete a location, complete the following steps:

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Administer* > *Locations*.
. Select *Delete* from the list to the right of the name of the location you want to delete.
. Click *OK* to delete the location.

.CLI procedure

. Enter the following command to retrieve the ID of the location that you want to delete:
+
[subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer location list
----
+
From the output, note the ID of the location that you want to delete.
+
. Enter the following command to delete the location:
+
[subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer location delete --id _Location ID_
----

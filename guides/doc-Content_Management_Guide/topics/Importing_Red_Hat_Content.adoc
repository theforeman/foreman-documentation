[[Importing_Red_Hat_Content]]
== Importing Red{nbsp}Hat Content

This section describes how to use products and repositories in {Project}, and to create synchronization plans to ensure your {Project} content remains up to date with the content on the Red{nbsp}Hat Content delivery network (CDN).

[[Importing_Red_Hat_Content-Products_in_Satellite]]
=== Products in {ProjectName}
In {Project}, a _Product_ is an organizational unit to group multiple repositories together. For example, Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise Linux Server is a _Product_ in {Project}, the repositories for that product consist of different versions, different architectures, and different add-ons. Using Products ensures repositories that depend on each other are synchronized together. For Red{nbsp}Hat repositories, products are created automatically after enabling the repository.


[[Importing_Red_Hat_Content-Synchronizing_Content]]
=== Content Synchronization Overview

{ProjectServer} synchronizes its own repositories with the repositories on the Red{nbsp}Hat CDN. This ensures that {ProjectServer} retains an exact copy of Red{nbsp}Hat's repositories. {ProjectServer} fetches this repository information and stores it on {ProjectServer}'s file system. After an initial synchronization, you can create a synchronization plan that checks to ensure the repositories are up to date with the CDN's repositories.

You can perform an initial synchronization using ISO images. For more information about using content ISOs, see xref:Importing_Content_ISOs_into_Connected_Satellite[].

[[Importing_Red_Hat_Content-Configuring_Download_Policies]]
=== Download Policies Overview

{ProjectName} provides multiple download policies for synchronizing RPM content. For example, you might want to download only the content metadata while deferring the actual content download for later.

{ProjectServer} has the following policies:

Immediate::
{ProjectServer} downloads all metadata and packages during synchronization.

On Demand::
{ProjectServer} downloads only the metadata during synchronization. {ProjectServer} only fetches and stores packages on the file system when {SmartProxies} or directly connected clients request them. This setting has no effect if you set a corresponding repository on a {SmartProxy} to *Immediate* because {ProjectServer} is forced to download all the packages.

Background::
{ProjectServer} creates a background task to download all packages after the initial synchronization.

The *On Demand* and *Background* policies act as a _Lazy Synchronization_ feature because they save time synchronizing content. The lazy synchronization feature must be used only for `yum` repositories. You can add the packages to Content Views and promote to life cycle environments as normal.

{SmartProxyServer} offers the following policies:

Immediate::
{SmartProxyServer} downloads all metadata and packages during synchronization. Do not use this setting if the corresponding repository on {ProjectServer} is set to *On Demand* as {ProjectServer} is forced to download all the packages.

On Demand::
{SmartProxyServer} only downloads the metadata during synchronization. {SmartProxyServer} fetches and stores packages only on the file system when directly connected clients request them. When you use an *On Demand* download policy, content is downloaded from {ProjectServer} if it is not available on {SmartProxyServer}.

Background::
{SmartProxyServer} creates a background task to download all packages after the initial synchronization.

Inherit::
{SmartProxyServer} inherits the download policy for the repository from the corresponding repository on {ProjectServer}.

These policies are not available if a {SmartProxy} was installed or updated with `--enable-foreman-proxy-plugin-pulp` set to false.

=== Changing the Default Download Policy

You can set the default download policy that {Project} applies to repositories that you create in all organizations. {Project} uses separate settings for Red Hat and {customrepos}. Changing the default value does not change existing settings.

.Procedure

To change the default download policy for repositories, complete the following steps:

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Administer* > *Settings*.
. Click the *Content* tab.
. Change the default download policy depending on your requirements:
+
* To change the default download policy for Red Hat repositories, change the value of the *Default Red Hat Repository download policy* setting.
* To change the default download policy for {customrepos}, change the value of the *Default Custom Repository download policy* setting.

.For CLI Users

To change the default download policy for Red Hat repositories to one of `immediate`, `on_demand`, or `background`, enter the following command:

[subs="+quotes"]topics/Managing_ISOs_and_Files.adoc
----
# hammer settings set \
--name default_redhat_download_policy \
--value _immediate_
----

To change the default download policy for {customrepos} to one of `immediate`, `on_demand`, or `background`, enter the following command:

[subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer settings set \
--name default_download_policy \
--value _immediate_
----

=== Changing the Download Policy for a Repository

You can also set the download policy for a repository.

.Procedure

To set the download policy for a repository, complete the following steps:

. In the web UI, navigate to *Content* > *Products*, and click the required product name.
. On the *Repositories* tab, click the required repository name, locate the *Download Policy* field, and click the edit icon.
. From the list, select the required download policy and then click `Save`.

.For CLI Users

. List the repositories for an organization:
+
[subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer repository list \
--organization-label _organization-label_
----

. Change the download policy for a repository to one of `immediate`, `on_demand`, `background`:
+
[subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer repository update \
--organization-label _organization-label_  \
--product "Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server" \
--name "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Server Kickstart x86_64 7.5"  \
--download-policy immediate
----

[[Importing_Red_Hat_Content-Selecting_Red_Hat_Repositories_to_Synchronize]]
=== Enabling Red{nbsp}Hat Repositories

To select the repositories to synchronize, you must first identify the product that contains the repository, and then enable that repository based on the relevant release version and base architecture. For Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise Linux 8, you must enable both AppStream and BaseOS repositories.

ifeval::["{build}" == "satellite"]
.Disconnected {Project}
If you use Disconnected {ProjectServer}, you must configure {Project} to synchronize content with a local CDN server before synchronizing content. For more information, see xref:configuring-satellite-to-synchronize-content-with-a-local-cdn-server_content-management[].
endif::[]

.Repository Versioning
The difference between associating Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise Linux operating system with either 7 Server repositories or 7._X_ repositories is that 7 Server repositories contain all the latest updates while Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise Linux 7._X_ repositories stop getting updates after the next minor version release. Note that Kickstart repositories only have minor versions.

.For Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Clients

To provision Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise Linux 8 clients, you require the *Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise Linux 8 for x86_64 - AppStream (RPMS)* and *Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise Linux 8 for x86_64 - BaseOS (RPMs)* repositories.

.For Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Clients

To provision Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise Linux 7 clients, you require the *Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Server (RPMs)* repository.

.Procedure

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Content* > *Red{nbsp}Hat Repositories*.
. To find repositories, either enter the repository name, or toggle the *Recommended Repositories* button to the on position to view a list of repositories that you require.
. In the Available Repositories pane, click a repository to expand the repository set.
. Click the *Enable* icon next to the base architecture and release version that you want.

.For CLI Users

. To search for your product, enter the following command:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer product list --organization "_My_Organization_"
----
+
. List the repository set for the product:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer repository-set list \
--product "Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server" \
--organization "_My_Organization_"
----
+
. Enable the repository using either the name or ID number. Include the release version, for example,`7Server` and base architecture, for example, `x86_64`. For example:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer repository-set enable \
--name "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Server (RPMs)" \
--releasever "7Server" \
--basearch "x86_64" \
--product "Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server" \
--organization "_My_Organization_"
----

[[Importing_Red_Hat_Content-Synchronizing_Red_Hat_Repositories]]
=== Synchronizing Red{nbsp}Hat Repositories

Synchronize the repositories with the Red{nbsp}Hat CDN's repositories.

.For Web UI Users

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Content* > *Products* and select the product that contains the repositories that you want to synchronize.
. Select the repositories that you want to synchronize and click *Sync Now*.

To view the progress of the synchronization in the web UI, navigate to *Content* > *Sync Status* and expand the corresponding product or repository tree.

.For CLI Users

Synchronize the enabled repositories in the Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise Linux Server product:

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer product synchronize \
--name "Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server" \
--organization "_My_Organization_"
----

You can also synchronize each repository individually. List all repositories in the product, then synchronize using the ID number for the corresponding repositories. For example:

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer repository list \
--product "Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server" \
--organization "_My_Organization_"
# hammer repository synchronize \
--name "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Server RPMs x86_64 7Server" \
--product "Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server" \
--organization "_My_Organization_"
----

The synchronization duration depends on the size of each repository and the speed of your network connection. The following table provides estimates of how long it would take to synchronize content, depending on the available Internet bandwidth:

|===
| |Single Package (10Mb)|Minor Release (750Mb)|Major Release (6Gb)

|256 Kbps|5 Mins 27 Secs|6 Hrs 49 Mins 36 Secs|2 Days 7 Hrs 55 Mins
|512 Kbps|2 Mins 43.84 Secs|3 Hrs 24 Mins 48 Secs|1 Day 3 Hrs 57 Mins
|T1 (1.5 Mbps)|54.33 Secs|1 Hr 7 Mins 54.78 Secs|9 Hrs 16 Mins 20.57 Secs
|10 Mbps|8.39 Secs|10 Mins 29.15 Secs|1 Hr 25 Mins 53.96 Secs
|100 Mbps|0.84 Secs|1 Min 2.91 Secs|8 Mins 35.4 Secs
|1000 Mbps|0.08 Secs|6.29 Secs|51.54 Secs
|===

Create a synchronization plan to ensure updates on a regular basis.

[[Importing_Red_Hat_Content-Synchronizing_All_Repositories_in_an_Organization]]
=== Synchronizing All Repositories in an Organization

Use this procedure to synchronize all repositories within an organization.

.Procedure

To synchronize all repositories within an organization, run the following Bash script on your {ProjectServer}:

[source, Bash, options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
ORG="_Your_Organization_"

for i in $(hammer --no-headers --csv repository list --organization $ORG | awk -F, {'print $1'})
do
  hammer repository synchronize --id ${i} --organization $ORG --async
done
----

[[Importing_Red_Hat_Content-Recovering_a_Repository]]
=== Recovering a Repository
In the case of repository corruption, you can recover it by using an advanced synchronization, which has three options:

Optimized Sync::
Synchronizes the repository bypassing RPMs that have no detected differences from the upstream RPMs.

Complete Sync::
Synchronizes all RPMs regardless of detected changes. Use this option if specific RPMs could not be downloaded to the local repository even though they exist in the upstream repository.

Validate Content Sync::
Synchronizes all RPMs and then verifies the checksum of all RPMs locally. If the checksum of an RPM differs from the upstream, it re-downloads the RPM. This option is relevant only for `yum` repositories. Use this option if you have one of the following errors:

* Specific RPMs cause a `404` error while synchronizing with `yum`.

* `Package does not match intended download` error, which means that specific RPMs are corrupted.

.Procedure

To synchronize a specific repository with an advanced option, complete the following steps:

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Content* > *Products*.
. Select the product containing the corrupted repository.
. Select the name of a repository you want to synchronize.
. From the *Select Action* menu, select *Advanced Sync*.
. Select the option and click *Sync*.

.For CLI users

. Obtain a list of repository IDs:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer repository list --organization "_My_Organization_"
----

. Synchronize a corrupted repository using the necessary option:

[[Importing_Red_Hat_Content-Limiting_Synchronization_Speed]]
=== Limiting Synchronization Speed

You can control the speed of synchronization to avoid exhaustion of available bandwidth and to prevent other performance issues. This is done by configuring *PULP_CONCURRENCY* and *max_speed* parameters. Note that these settings are overwritten on an upgrade. Back up any changed files prior to an upgrade to be able to restore the configuration.

. To control the number of synchronization jobs that run in parallel, configure the *PULP_CONCURRENCY* parameter in the `/etc/default/pulp_workers` file. For example, to set the number of jobs that run in parallel to 1, change `PULP_CONCURRENCY` to 1:
+
----
PULP_CONCURRENCY=1
----
+
By default, on a system with less than 8 CPUs, `PULP_CONCURRENCY` is set to the number of CPUs. On a system with more than 8 CPUs, it is set to 8.

. To set the maximum network speed for synchronizing in bytes per second, configure the *max_speed* parameter. This parameter must be configured separately for each importer in the `/etc/pulp/server/plugins.conf.d/` directory. For example, to set the maximum speed for synchronizing RPM content to 10 bytes per second, set the `"max_speed"` parameter in the `/etc/pulp/server/plugins.conf.d/yum_importer.json` file to 10:
+
----
# cat /etc/pulp/server/plugins.conf.d/yum_importer.json
{
    "proxy_host": null,
    "proxy_port": null,
    "proxy_username": null,
    "proxy_password": null,
    "max_speed": 10
}
----

. Verify the syntax of the file after editing:
+
----
# json_verify < /etc/pulp/server/plugins.conf.d/yum_importer.json
JSON is valid
----

. Restart the `{foreman-maintain}` services to apply the changes:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} service restart

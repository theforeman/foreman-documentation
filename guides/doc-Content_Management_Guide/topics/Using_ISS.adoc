== Synchronizing Content Between {ProjectServer}s

{ProjectName}{nbsp}{ProductVersion} uses Inter-{Project} Synchronization (ISS) to synchronize content {ProjectServer}s, or between organizations on {ProjectServer}.

You can use ISS in the following scenarios:

ifdef::satellite[]
* If you have both connected and disconnected {ProjectServer}s, and want to copy content from the connected servers to the disconnected servers.
For example, you require complete isolation of management infrastructure for security or other purposes.
endif::[]

* If you want to copy some but not all content from your {ProjectServer} to other {ProjectServer}s.
For example, you have Content Views that your IT department validates on {ProjectServer}, and you want to copy content from those Content Views to other {ProjectServer}s.

* If you want to clone a Content View from one organization to another organization on {ProjectServer}.

You cannot use ISS to synchronize content from {ProjectServer} to {SmartProxyServer}.
{SmartProxyServer} supports synchronization natively.
For more information, see {PlanningDocURL}chap-Documentation-Architecture_Guide-Capsule_Server_Overview[{SmartProxyServer} Overview] in _Planning for {ProjectNameX}_.

[[Using_ISS-Exporting-a-Content-View-Version]]
=== Exporting a Content View Version

You can export a version of a Content View to an archive file from {ProjectServer} and use this archive file to create the same Content View version on another {ProjectServer} or on another {ProjectServer} organization.
{Project} does not export composite Content Views.
The exported archive file contains the following data:

* A JSON file containing Content View version metadata
* An archive file containing all the repositories included into the Content View version

{ProjectServer} exports only RPM and kickstart files added to a version of a Content View.
{Project} does not export the following content:

* Puppet content
* Docker content
* OSTree content
* Content View definitions and metadata, such as package filters.

.Prerequisites

To export a Content View, ensure that {ProjectServer} where you want to export meets the following conditions:

* Ensure that the export directory has free storage space to accommodate the export.
* Ensure that the `/var/lib/pulp/exports` directory has free storage space equivalent to the size of the repositories being exported for temporary files created during the export process.
* Ensure that you set download policy to *Immediate* for all repositories within the Content View you export.
For more information, see xref:Importing_Content-Configuring_Download_Policies[].
* Ensure that you synchronize Products that you export to the required date.
* Ensure that the user exporting the content has the `Content Exporter` role.

.To Export a Content View Version:

. List versions of the Content View that are available for export:
+

.Export a Content View version
Get the version number of desired version. The following example targets version `1.0` for export.

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer content-export complete version --content-view=view --version=1.0 --organization=export-21527
----

. Verify that the archive containing the exported version of a Content View is located in the export directory:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# ls -lh /var/lib/pulp/exports/export-21527/view/1.0/2021-02-25T18-59-26-00-00/

----

. You require all three files, for example, the `tar.gz` archive file, the `toc.json` and `metadata.json` to import the content successfully.

.Export with chunking

In many cases, the exported archive content can be several gigabytes in size. You might want to split it smaller sizes or chunks. You can use the `--chunk-size-gb` option with in the `hammer content-export` command to handle this. The following example uses the `--chunk-size-gb=2` to split the archives into `2 GB` chunks.

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer content-export complete version --content-view=view --version=1.0 --organization=export-21527 --chunk-size-gb=2

# ls -lh  /var/lib/pulp/exports/export-21527/view/1.0/2021-02-25T21-15-22-00-00/
----


.Incremental Export

Exporting complete versions can be a very expensive operation on storage space and resources. Content View versions that have multiple {RHEL} trees can occupy several gigabytes of the space on {ProjectServer}.

You can use the *Incremental Export* functionality to help reduce demands on your infrastructure.
*Incremental Export* exports only content that changes from the previously exported version.
Generally, incremental changes are smaller than full exports.
ln the following example, since version `1.0` has already been exported and the command targets version 2.0 for export.
To use incremental export, complete the following steps.

----
# hammer content-export incremental version --content-view=view --version=2.0 --organization=export-21527

# ls -lh /var/lib/pulp/exports/export-21527/view/2.0/2021-02-25T21-45-34-00-00/
----

=== Examining the exports

You can query on the exports that you previously have created via the `hammer content-export list` command.

=== Importing a Content View Version

You can use the archive that the `hammer content-export` command outputs to create a version of a Content View with the same content as the exported Content View version.
For more information about exporting a Content View version, see xref:Using_ISS-Exporting-a-Content-View-Version[].

When you import a Content View version, it has the same major and minor version numbers and contains the same repositories with the same packages and errata.
The Custom Repositories, Products and Content Views are automatically created if they do not exist in the importing organization.

.Prerequisites

To import a Content View, ensure that {ProjectServer} where you want to import meets the following conditions:

. The exported archive must be in a directory under `/var/lib/pulp/imports`.
. The directory must have `pulp:pulp` permissions so that Pulp can read and write the `.json` files in that directory.
. The user importing the content view version must have the 'Content Importer' Role.

.Procedure

. Copy the archived file with the exported Content View version to the `/var/lib/pulp/imports` directory on {ProjectServer} where you want to import.
. Set the user:group permission of the archive files to `pulp:pulp`.

[[Using_ISS-Exporting-Library]]
=== Exporting a Content View Version

You can export contents of all Yum repositories in the Library environment of an organization to an archive file from {ProjectServer} and use this archive file to create the same repositories in another {ProjectServer} or in another {ProjectServer} organization.
The exported archive file contains the following data:

* A JSON file containing Content View version metadata
* An archive file containing all the repositories from the Library environment of the organization.

{ProjectServer} exports only RPM and kickstart files included in a Content View  version.
{Project} does not export the following content:

* Puppet content
* Docker content
* OSTree content

.Prerequisites

To export the contents of the Library lifecycle environment of the organization, ensure that {ProjectServer} where you want to export meets the following conditions:

* Ensure that the export directory has free storage space to accommodate the export.
* Ensure that the `/var/lib/pulp/exports` directory has free storage space equivalent to the size of the repositories being exported for temporary files created during the export process.
* Ensure that you set download policy to *Immediate* for all repositories within the Library lifecycle environment you export.
For more information, see xref:Importing_Content-Configuring_Download_Policies[].
* Ensure that you synchronize Products that you export to the required date.

.To Export the Library Content of an Organization:

Use the organization name or ID to export.

----

. You require all three files, for example, the `tar.gz`, the `toc.json` and the `metadata.json` file to be able to import.
. A new Content View  **Export-Library** is created in the organization. This content view contains all the repositories belonging to this organization. A new version of this Content View is published and exported automatically.

.Export with chunking

In many cases the exported archive content may be several gigabytes in size.
If you want to split it into smaller sizes or chunks.
You can use the `--chunk-size-gb` flag directly in the export command to handle this.
In the following example, you can see how to specify `--chunk-size-gb=2` to split the archives in `2 GB` chunks.

.Incremental Export

Exporting Library content can be a very expensive operation in terms of space and resources. Organization that have multiple RHEL trees may occupy several gigabytes of the space on {ProjectServer}.

{ProjectServer} offers *Incremental Export* to help with this scenario.
*Incremental Export* exports only things that changed from the previous export.
These would be typically smaller than the full exports.
In the example below we will incrementally export what changed from the previous export of all the repositories in the Library lifecycle environment.

. Since nothing changed between the previous export and now in the Organization's library environment the change files are really small.

=== Importing a Content View Version

You can use the archive that the `hammer content-export` command outputs to import into the Library lifecycle environment of another organization
For more information about exporting contents from the Library environment, see xref:Using_ISS-Exporting-Library[].

.Prerequisites

To import in to an Organization's library lifecycle environment  ensure that {ProjectServer} where you want to import meets the following conditions:

* The products and repositories in the organization need to match the product/repository structure in the content archive being imported.

.Procedure

. Copy the archived file with the exported Content View version to the `/var/lib/pulp/imports` directory on {ProjectServer} where you want to import.
. Set the permission of the archive files to `pulp:pulp`.

----
+
. On {ProjectServer} where you want to import, create/enable repositories the same name and label as the exported content.
. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Content* > *Products*, click the *Yum content* tab and add the same `Yum` content that the exported Content View version includes.
. Identify the Organization that you wish to import into.
. To import the Library content to {ProjectServer}, enter the following command:
+
[subs="+quotes"]

[[Using_ISS]]
== Synchronizing Content Between {ProjectServer}s

{ProjectName}{nbsp}{ProductVersion} uses Inter-{Project} Synchronization (ISS) to synchronize content {ProjectServer}s, or between organizations on {ProjectServer}.

You can use ISS in the following scenarios:

ifeval::["{build}" == "satellite"]
* If you have both connected and disconnected {ProjectServer}s, and want to copy content from the connected servers to the disconnected servers. For example, you require complete isolation of management infrastructure for security or other purposes.
endif::[]

* If you want to copy some but not all content from your {ProjectServer} to other {ProjectServer}s. For example, you have Content Views that your IT department validates on {ProjectServer}, and you want to copy content from those Content Views to other {ProjectServer}s.

* If you want to clone a Content View from one organization to another organization on {ProjectServer}.

You cannot use ISS to synchronize content from {ProjectServer} to {SmartProxyServer}. {SmartProxyServer} supports synchronization natively. For more information, see {BaseURL}planning_for_red_hat_satellite_6/chap-documentation-architecture_guide-capsule_server_overview[{SmartProxyServer} Overview] in _Planning for {ProjectNameX}_.

[[Using_ISS-Exporting-a-Content-View-Version]]
=== Exporting a Content View Version

You can export a version of a Content View to an archive file from {ProjectServer} and use this archive file to create the same Content View version on another {ProjectServer} or on another {ProjectServer} organization. {Project} does not export composite Content Views. The exported archive file contains the following data:

* A JSON file containing Content View version metadata
* An archive file containing all the repositories included into the Content View version

{ProjectServer} exports only RPM and kickstart files added to a version of a Content View. {Project} does not export the following content:

* Puppet content
* Docker content
* OSTree content
* Content View definitions and metadata, such as package filters.

.Changes to the hammer content-view version export command

The new `hammer content-view version export` and `hammer content-view version import` commands work differently from the commands in the previous versions of {Project}. The old feature is still available with the `hammer content-view version export-legacy` command. The old feature has the following functionality that does not exist in the new feature:

ifeval::["{build}" == "satellite"]
* You can patch a disconnected {ProjectServer} from a connected {ProjectServer} directly. `hammer content-view version export-legacy` exports the CDN structure, therefore, you do not have to use a DVD ISO from the Red Hat Customer Portal.
endif::[]

* When exporting a Content View that contains non-yum content, `hammer content-view version export-legacy` skips the non-yum content and exports the Content View, while `hammer content-view version export` prompts you to remove a non-yum repository and fails.

ifeval::["{build}" == "satellite"]
For more information about using the old feature, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_satellite/6.4/html/content_management_guide/using_iss[Synchronizing Content Between Satellite servers] in the Satellite 6.4 Content Management Guide.
endif::[]

.Prerequisites

To export a Content View, ensure that the {ProjectServer} where you want to export meets the following conditions:

* Ensure that the export directory has free storage space to accommodate the export.
* Ensure that the `/var/lib/pulp/` directory has free storage space equivalent to the size of the repositories being exported for temporary files created during the export process.
* Ensure that the `/var/cache/pulp` directory has free storage space equivalent to twice of the size of the repository being exported for temporary files created during the export process.
* Ensure that you set download policy to *Immediate* for all repositories within the Content View you export. For more information, see xref:Importing_Red_Hat_Content-Configuring_Download_Policies[].
* Ensure that you clear the *Mirror on Sync* check box for the repositories that you import on the repository settings page.
* Ensure that you synchronize Products that you export to the required date.

.To Export a Content View Version:

. List Content Views to determine the ID of a Content View version you want to export:
+
[subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer content-view version list \
--organization "_Default Organization_"
----

. Export the version of a Content View. Specify the directory where to store the export with the `--export-dir` option and the ID of the Content View version that you export with the `--id` option. The `pulp_export_destination` setting does not work for this procedure.
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer content-view version export --export-dir _export_directory_ \
--id _content_view_version_ID_
----
+
. Verify that the archive containing the exported version of a Content View is located in the export directory:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# ls _export_directory_
_export-1.tar_
----

=== Importing a Content View Version

You can use the archive that the `hammer content-view version export` command outputs to create a version of a Content View with the same content as the exported Content View version. For more information about exporting a Content View version, see xref:Using_ISS-Exporting-a-Content-View-Version[].

When you import a Content View version, it has the same major and minor version numbers and contains the same repositories with the same packages and errata. You can customize the version numbers by changing the `major` and `minor` settings in the `json` file that is located in the exported archive.

.Prerequisites

To import a Content View, ensure that the {ProjectServer} where you want to import meets the following conditions:

ifeval::["{build}" == "satellite"]
* If you want to import a Content View to {Project} in a disconnected environment, you must configure {Project} to synchronize content with a local CDN server and then synchronize content that the CV you export contains. For more information, see xref:configuring-satellite-to-synchronize-content-with-a-local-cdn-server_content-management[].
endif::[]

* Ensure that you set download policy to *Immediate* for all repositories within the Content View you export. For more information, see xref:Importing_Red_Hat_Content-Configuring_Download_Policies[].
* Ensure that you clear the *Mirror on Sync* check box for the repositories that you import on the repository settings page.

.Procedure

. Copy the archived file with the exported Content View version to the `/var/lib/pulp/katello-export` directory on the {ProjectServer} where you want to import.
. On the {ProjectServer} where you want to import, create a Content View with the same name and label as the exported Content View. For more information, see xref:Managing_Content_Views-Creating_a_Simple_Content_View_CLI[].
. Ensure that you enable the repositories that the Products in the exported Content View version include. For more information, see xref:Importing_Red_Hat_Content-Selecting_Red_Hat_Repositories_to_Synchronize[].
. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Content* > *Products*, click the *Yum content* tab and add the same `Yum` content that the exported Content View version includes.
. Until https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1745081[BZ#1745081] is resolved, navigate to the `/var/lib/pulp/katello-export` directory:
+
[subs="+quotes"]
----
# cd /var/lib/pulp/katello-export
----
+
. To import the Content View version to {ProjectServer}, enter the following command:
+
[subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer content-view version import \
--export-tar /var/lib/pulp/katello-export/_exported_CV_archive_.tar \
--organization-id _Your_Organization_ID_
----
+
Note that until https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1745081[BZ#1745081] is resolved, you must enter the full path `/var/lib/pulp/katello-export/`. Relative paths do not work.
+
. To verify that you import the Content View version successfully, list Content Views for your organization:
+
[subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer content-view version list --organization "_Your_Organization_"
----

[[Managing_Custom_File_Type_Content]]
== Managing {customfiletypetitle} Content

In {Project}, you might require methods of managing and distributing SSH keys and source code files or larger files such as virtual machine images and ISO files. To achieve this, (customproduct)s in {ProjectName} include repositories for {customfiletype}s. This provides a generic method to incorporate arbitrary files in a product.

You can upload files to the repository and synchronize files from an upstream {ProjectServer}. When you add files to a {customfiletype} repository, you can use the normal {Project} management functions such as adding a specific version to a Content View to provide version control and making the repository of files available on various {SmartProxyServer}s. Clients must download the files over HTTP or HTTPS using `curl -O`.

You can create a file type repository in {ProjectServer} only in a (customproduct), but there is flexibility in how you create the file type repository. You can create an independent file type repository in a directory on the system where {Project} is installed, or on a remote HTTP server, and then synchronize the contents of that directory into {Project}. This method is useful when you have multiple files to add to a {Project} repository.

[[Importing_Custom_Content-Creating_a_Custom_File_Type_Repository]]
=== Creating a {customfiletypetitle} Repository in {ProjectName}

The procedure for creating a {customfiletype} repository is the same as the procedure for creating any {customcontent}, except that when you create the repository, you select the *file* type. You must create a product and then add a {customrepo}.

.Procedure

To create a (customproduct), complete the following procedure:

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Content* > *Products*, click *Create Product* and enter the following details:
. In the *Name* field, enter a name for the product. {Project} automatically completes the *Label* field based on what you have entered for *Name*.
. Optional: From the *GPG Key* list, select the GPG key for the product.
. Optional: From the *Sync Plan* list, select a synchronization plan for the product.
. In the *Description* field, enter a description of the product, and then click *Save*.

To create a repository for your (customproduct), complete the following procedure:

. In the Products window, select the name of a product that you want to create a repository for.
. Click the *Repositories* tab, and then click *New Repository*.
. In the *Name* field, enter a name for the repository. {Project} automatically completes the *Label* field based on the name.
. From the *Type* list, select *file*.
. In the *Upstream URL* field, enter the URL of the upstream repository to use as a source.
. Select the *Verify SSL* check box if you want to verify that the upstream repository's SSL certificates are signed by a trusted CA.
. In the *Upstream Username* field, enter the user name for the upstream repository if required for authentication. Clear this field if the repository does not require authentication.
. In the *Upstream Password* field, enter the corresponding password for the upstream repository. Clear this field if the repository does not require authentication.
. Click *Save*.

[[Importing_Custom_Content-Creating_a_Custom_File_Type_Repository_Local_Directory]]
=== Creating a {customfiletypetitle} Repository in a Local Directory

You can create a {customfiletype} repository, from a directory of files, on the base system where {Project} is installed using the `pulp-manifest` command. You can then synchronize the files into {ProjectServer}. When you add files to a file type repository, you can work with the files as with any other repository.

Use this procedure to configure a repository in a directory on the base system where {Project} is installed. To create a file type repository in a directory on a remote server, see xref:Managing_Custom_File_Type_Content-Creating_a_Remote_File_Type_Repository[].

.Procedure

To create a file type repository in a local directory, complete the following procedure:

. Ensure the Server and {project-client-name} repositories are enabled.
ifeval::["build" == "satellite"]
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# subscription-manager repos --enable={RepoRHEL7Server} \
--enable={project-client-RHEL7-url}
----
endif::[]

. Install the Pulp Manifest package:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# {package-install-project} python-pulp-manifest
----
+
. Create a directory that you want to use as the file type repository in the HTTP server's public folder:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# mkdir __my_file_repo__
----
+
. Add files to the directory or create a test file:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# touch __my_file_repo__/_test.txt_
----
+
. Enter the Pulp Manifest command to create the manifest:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# pulp-manifest __my_file_repo__
----
+
. Verify the manifest was created:

.Importing Files from a File Type Repository

To import files from a file type repository in a local directory, complete the following procedure:

. Ensure a {customproduct} exists in {ProjectServer}.
. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Content* > *Products*.
. Select the name of a product.
. Click the *Repositories* tab and select *New Repository*.
. In the *Name* field, enter a name for the repository. {Project} automatically completes this field based on what you enter for *Name*.
. From the *Type* list, select the content type of the repository.
. In the *Upstream URL* field, enter the local directory with the repository to use as the source, in the form `\file:///__my_file_repo__`.

. Visit the URL where the repository is published to see the files.

[[Managing_Custom_File_Type_Content-Creating_a_Remote_File_Type_Repository]]
=== Creating a Remote File Type Repository

You can create a {customfiletype} repository from a directory of files that is external to {ProjectServer} using the `pulp-manifest` command. You can then synchronize the files into {ProjectServer} over HTTP or HTTPS. When you add files to a file type repository, you can work with the files as with any other repository.

Use this procedure to configure a repository in a directory on a remote server. To create a file type repository in a directory on the base system where {ProjectServer} is installed, see xref:Importing_Custom_Content-Creating_a_Custom_File_Type_Repository_Local_Directory[].

.Prerequisites

Before you create a remote file type repository, ensure the following conditions exist:

* You have a Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise{nbsp}Linux{nbsp}7 server registered to your {Project} or the Red{nbsp}Hat CDN.
ifeval::["{build}" == "satellite"]
* Your server has an entitlement to the Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise{nbsp}Linux{nbsp}Server and {project-client-name} repositories.
endif::[]
* You have installed an HTTP server.

[[Importing_Custom_Content-Downloading_Files_From_a_Custom_File_Type_Repository]]
=== Downloading Files to a Host From a {customfiletypetitle} Repository in {ProjectName}

You can download files to a client over HTTPS using `curl -O`, and optionally over HTTP if the *Publish via HTTP* repository option is selected.

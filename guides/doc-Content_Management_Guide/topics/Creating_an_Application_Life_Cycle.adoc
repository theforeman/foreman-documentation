== Managing Application Life Cycles

This chapter outlines the application life cycle in {Project} and how to create and remove application life cycles for {Project} and {SmartProxy}.

[[Introduction-App_Life_Cycle]]
=== Application Life Cycle Overview

The _application life cycle_ is a concept central to {ProjectNameX}'s content management functions.
The application life cycle defines how a particular system and its software look at a particular stage.
For example, an application life cycle might be simple; you might only have a development stage and production stage.
In this case the application life cycle might look like this:

* Development
* Production

However, a more complex application life cycle might have further stages, such as a phase for testing or a beta release.
This adds extra stages to the application life cycle:

* Development
* Testing
* Beta Release
* Production

{ProjectNameX} provides methods to customize each application life cycle stage so that it suits your specifications.

Each stage in the application life cycle is called an _environment_ in {ProjectNameX}.
Each environment uses a specific collection of content.
{ProjectNameX} defines these content collections as a Content View.
Each Content View acts as a filter where you can define what repositories, packages, and Puppet modules to include in a particular environment.
This provides a method for you to define specific sets of content to designate to each environment.

For example, an email server might only require a simple application life cycle where you have a production-level server for real-world use and a test server for trying out the latest mail server packages.
When the test server passes the initial phase, you can set the production-level server to use the new packages.

Another example is a development life cycle for a software product.
To develop a new piece of software in a development environment, test it in a quality assurance environment, pre-release as a beta, then release the software as a production-level application.

=== Promoting Content across the Application Life Cycle

In the application life cycle chain, when content moves from one environment to the next, this is called _promotion_.

.Example Content Promotion Across {Project} Life Cycle Environments

Each environment contains a set of systems registered to {ProjectNameX}.
These systems only have access to repositories relevant to their environment.
When you promote packages from one environment to the next, the target environment's repositories receive new package versions.
As a result, each system in the target environment can update to the new package versions.

|===
| Development | Testing | Production

| _example_software_-1.1-0.noarch.rpm | _example_software_-1.0-0.noarch.rpm | _example_software_-1.0-0.noarch.rpm
|===

After completing development on the patch, you promote the RPM to the Testing environment so the Quality Engineering team can review the patch.
The application life cycle then contains the following package versions in each environment:

|===
| Development | Testing | Production

| _example_software_-1.1-0.noarch.rpm | *_example_software_-1.1-0.noarch.rpm* | _example_software_-1.0-0.noarch.rpm
|===

While the Quality Engineering team reviews the patch, the Development team starts work on _example_software_ 2.0.
This results in the following application life cycle:

|===
| Development | Testing | Production

| *exampleware-2.0-0.noarch.rpm* | exampleware-1.1-0.noarch.rpm | exampleware-1.0-0.noarch.rpm
|===

The Quality Engineering team completes their review of the patch.
Now _example_software_ 1.1 is ready to release.
You promote 1.1 to the _Production_ environment:

|===
| Development | Testing | Production

| _example_software_-2.0-0.noarch.rpm | _example_software_-1.1-0.noarch.rpm | *_example_software_-1.1-0.noarch.rpm*
|===

The Development team completes their work on _example_software_ 2.0 and promotes it to the Testing environment:

|===
| Development | Testing | Production

| _example_software_-2.0-0.noarch.rpm | *_example_software_-2.0-0.noarch.rpm* | _example_software_-1.1-0.noarch.rpm
|===

Finally, the Quality Engineering team reviews the package.
After a successful review, promote the package to the _Production_ environment:

|===
| Development | Testing | Production

| exampleware-2.0-0.noarch.rpm | exampleware-2.0-0.noarch.rpm | *exampleware-2.0-0.noarch.rpm*
|===

=== Creating a Life Cycle Environment Path

To create an application life cycle for developing and releasing software, use the _Library_ environment as the initial environment to create environment paths.
Then optionally add additional environments to the environment paths.

.Procedure

. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Content* > *Lifecycle Environments*.
. Click *New Environment Path* to start a new application life cycle.
. In the *Name* field, enter a name for your environment.
. In the *Description* field, enter a description for your environment.
. Click *Save*.
. Optional: To add an environment to the environment path, click *Add New Environment*, complete the *Name* and *Description* fields, and select the prior environment from the *Prior Environment* list.

.CLI procedure

. To create an environment path, enter the `hammer lifecycle-environment create` command and specify the Library environment with the `--prior` option:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer lifecycle-environment create \
--name "_Environment Path Name_" \
--description "_Environment Path Description_" \
--prior "Library" \
--organization "_My_Organization_"
----

. Optional: To add an environment to the environment path, enter the `hammer lifecycle-environment create` command and specify the parent environment with the `--prior` option:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer lifecycle-environment create \
--name "_Environment Name_" \
--description "_Environment Description_" \
--prior "_Prior Environment Name_" \
--organization "_My_Organization_"
----

. To view the chain of the life cycle environment, enter the following command:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer lifecycle-environment paths --organization "_My_Organization_"
----

[[Creating_an_Application_Life_Cycle-Removing_Life_Cycle_Environments]]
=== Removing Life Cycle Environments from {ProjectServer}

Use this procedure to remove a life cycle environment.

.Procedure

. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Content* > *Life Cycle Environments*.
. Click the name of the life cycle environment that you want to remove, and then click *Remove Environment*.
. Click *Remove* to remove the environment.

.CLI procedure

. List the life cycle environments for your organization and note the name of the life cycle environment you want to remove:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer lifecycle-environment list --organization "_My_Organization_"
----
+
. Use the `hammer lifecycle-environment delete` command to remove an environment:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer lifecycle-environment delete \
--name "_your_environment_" \
--organization "_My_Organization_"
----

=== Removing Life Cycle Environments from {SmartProxyServer}

When life cycle environments are no longer relevant to the host system or environments are added incorrectly to {SmartProxyServer}, you can remove the life cycle environments from {SmartProxyServer}.

You can use both the {ProjectWebUI} and the Hammer to remove life cycle environments from {SmartProxy}.

.Procedure

. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Infrastructure* > *{SmartProxies}*, and select the {SmartProxy} that you want to remove a life cycle from.
. Click *Edit* and click the *Life Cycle Environments* tab.
. From the right menu, select the life cycle environments that you want to remove from {SmartProxy}, and then click *Submit*.
. To synchronize {SmartProxy}'s content, click the *Overview* tab, and then click *Synchronize*.
. Select either *Optimized Sync* or *Complete Sync*.

.CLI procedure

. Select {SmartProxyServer} that you want from the list and take note of its *id*:
+
----
# hammer capsule list
----
+
. To verify {SmartProxyServer}'s details, enter the following command:
+
[subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer capsule info --id _capsule_id_
----
. Verify the list of life cycle environments currently attached to {SmartProxyServer} and take note of the *environment id*:
+
[subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer capsule content lifecycle-environments \
--id _capsule_id_
----
. Remove the life cycle environment from {SmartProxyServer}:
+
[subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer capsule content remove-lifecycle-environment \
--id _capsule_id_ \
--lifecycle-environment-id _lifecycle_environment_id_
----
+
Repeat this step for every life cycle environment that you want to remove from {SmartProxyServer}.
+
. Synchronize the content from {ProjectServer}'s environment to {SmartProxyServer}:
+
[subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer capsule content synchronize \
--id _capsule_id_
----

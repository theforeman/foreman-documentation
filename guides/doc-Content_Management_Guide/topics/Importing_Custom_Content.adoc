[[Importing_Custom_Content]]
== Importing {customcontenttitle}

This chapter outlines how you can import {customcontent} of different types to {Project}. If you want to import ISOs, Puppet modules, or different content types to {Project}, it is done with largely the same procedures in this chapter.

For example, you can use the following chapters for information on specific types of {customcontent} but the underlying procedures are the same:

* xref:Managing_OSTree_Content[]
* xref:Managing_ISO_Images[]
* xref:Managing_Custom_File_Type_Content[]
* xref:Managing_Custom_Puppet_Content[]

[[Using_Custom_Products_in_Satellite]]
=== Using {customproducttitle}s in {Project}

ifeval::["{build}" == "satellite"]
Both Red Hat content and {customcontent} in {Project} have similarities:
endif::[]

ifeval::["{build}" != "satellite"]
Both Red Hat content and non-RH {customcontent} in {Project} have similarities:
endif::[]

  - The relationship between a product and its repositories is the same and the repositories still require synchronization.
  - {customproduct} require a subscription for clients to access, similar to subscriptions to Red Hat Products. {Project} creates a subscription for each {customproduct} you create.

For more information about creating and packaging RPMs, see the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html-single/rpm_packaging_guide/[RPM Packaging Guide] in the Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise Linux documentation.

[[Importing_Custom_Content-Importing_Custom_SSL_Certificates]]
=== Importing {customssltitle} Certificates

Before you create {customcontent}, ensure that you import any {customssl} certificates that you require.

If you require SSL certificates and keys to download RPMs, you can add them to {Project}.

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Content* > *Content Credentials*. In the Content Credentials window, click *Create Content Credential*.
. In the *Name* field, enter a name for your SSL certificate.
. From the *Type* list, select *SSL Certificate*.
. In the *Content Credentials Content* field, paste your SSL certificate, or click *Browse* to upload your SSL certificate.
. Click *Save*.


[[Importing_Custom_Content-Importing_a_Custom_GPG_Key]]
=== Importing a {customgpgtitle} Key

Before you create {customcontent}, ensure that you import any GPG keys that you require.

.Prerequisites

. Download a copy of the version specific repository package to your client system:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
$ wget _http://www.example.com/9.5/example-9.5-2.noarch.rpm_
----
+
. Extract the RPM file without installing it:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
$ rpm2cpio _example-9.5-2.noarch.rpm_ | cpio -idmv
----

The GPG key is located relative to the extraction at `etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-_EXAMPLE-95_`.

.Procedure

To import a GPG key, complete the following procedure:

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Content* > *Content Credentials* and in the upper-right of the window, click *Create Content Credential*.
. Enter the name of your repository and select *GPG Key* from the *Type* list.
. Either paste the GPG key into the *Content Credential Contents* field, or click *Browse* and select the GPG key file that you want to import.
+
If your {customrepo} contains content signed by multiple GPG keys, you must enter all required GPG keys in the *Content Credential Contents* field with new lines between each key, for example:

. Click *Save*.

.For CLI Users

. Copy the GPG key to your {ProjectServer}:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
$ scp ~/etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-_EXAMPLE-95_ root@{foreman-example-com}:~/.
----
+
. Upload the GPG key to {Project}:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer gpg create \
--key ~/RPM-GPG-KEY-_EXAMPLE-95_ \
--name "_My_Repository_" \
--organization "_My_Organization_"
----

[[Importing_Custom_Content-Creating_a_Custom_Product]]
=== Creating a {customproducttitle}

Use this procedure to create a {customproduct} that you can then add repositories to.

.Procedure

To create a {customproduct}, complete the following procedure:

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Content* > *Products*, click *Create Product*.
. In the *Name* field, enter a name for the product. {Project} automatically completes the *Label* field based on what you have entered for *Name*.
. Optional: From the *GPG Key* list, select the GPG key for the product.
. Optional: From the *SSL CA Cert* list, select the SSL CA certificate for the product.
. Optional: From the *SSL Client Cert* list, select the SSL client certificate for the product.
. Optional: From the *SSL Client Key* list, select the SSL client key for the product.
. Optional: From the *Sync Plan* list, select an existing sync plan or click *Create Sync Plan* and create a sync plan for your product requirements.
. In the *Description* field, enter a description of the product.
. Click *Save*.

.For CLI Users

To create the product, enter the following command:

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer product create \
--name "_My_Product_" \
--sync-plan "_Example Plan_" \
--description "_Content from My Repositories_" \
--organization "_My_Organization_"
----

[[Importing_Custom_Content-Creating_a_Custom_RPM_Repository]]
=== Adding {customrpmtitle} Repositories

Use this procedure to add {customrpm} repositories in {Project}.

The Products window in the {Project} web UI also provides a *Repo Discovery* function that finds all repositories from a URL and you can select which ones to add to your {customproduct}. For example, you can use the *Repo Discovery* to search, for example, `http://yum.postgresql.org/9.5/redhat/` and list all repositories for different Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions and architectures. This helps users save time importing multiple repositories from a single source.

ifeval::["{build}" == "satellite"]

.Support for {customrpmtitle}s

Red Hat does not support the upstream RPMs directly from third-party sites. These RPMs are used to demonstrate the synchronization process. For any issues with these RPMs, contact the third-party developers.

endif::[]

.Procedure

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Content* > *Products* and select the product that you want to use, and then click *Create Repository*.
. In the *Name* field, enter a name for the repository. {ProjectNameX} automatically completes the *Label* field based on what you have entered for *Name*.
. From the *Type* list, select the type of repository. You can select either a repository for RPM files (`yum`), Puppet modules (`puppet`), or Docker images (`docker`).
. In the *URL* field, enter the URL of the external repository to use as a source.
. From the *Download Policy* list, select the type of synchronization {ProjectServer} performs.
. Ensure that the *Mirror on Sync* check box is selected. This ensures that the content that is no longer part of the upstream repository is removed during synchronization.
. From the *Checksum* list, select the checksum type for the repository.
. Optional: If you want, you can clear the *Publish via HTTP* check box to disable this repository from publishing through HTTP.
. Optional: From the *GPG Key* list, select the GPG key for the product.
. Click *Save*.

If you want to perform an immediate synchronization, in your product window, click *Sync Now*.

.For CLI Users

. Enter the following command to create the repository:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer repository create \
--name "_My_Repository_" \
--content-type "yum" \
--publish-via-http true \
--url _http://yum.postgresql.org/9.5/redhat/rhel-7-x86_64/_ \
--gpg-key "_My_Repository_" \
--product "_My_Product_" \
--organization "_My_Organization_"
----
+
. Synchronize the repository:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer repository synchronize \
--name "_My_Repository_" \
--product "_My Product_" \
--organization "_My_Organization_"
----

[[uploading-content-to-a-custom-rpm-repository]]
=== Uploading Content to {customrpmtitle} Repositories

[[Importing_Content]]
== Importing Content

This chapter outlines how you can import different types of {customcontent} to {Project}.
If you want to import Rpms, Files, or different content types to {Project}, it is done with largely the same procedures in this chapter.

For example, you can use the following chapters for information on specific types of {customcontent} but the underlying procedures are the same:

* xref:Managing_ISO_Images[]
* xref:Managing_Custom_File_Type_Content[]

[[Using_Custom_Products_in_Satellite]]
=== Using Products and Repositories in {Project}

ifdef::satellite[]
Both Red Hat content and {customcontent} in {Project} have similarities:
endif::[]

ifndef::satellite[]
Both Red Hat content and non-RH {customcontent} in {Project} have similarities:
endif::[]

* The relationship between a product and its repositories is the same and the repositories still require synchronization.
* {customproduct}s require a subscription for clients to access, similar to subscriptions to Red Hat Products.
{Project} creates a subscription for each {customproduct} you create.


Red Hat Content is already organized into Products. For example, {RHEL} Server is a _Product_ in {Project}. The repositories for that Product consist of different versions, architectures, and add-ons.
For Red{nbsp}Hat repositories, products are created automatically after enabling the repository. See xref:Importing_Content-Selecting_Red_Hat_Repositories_to_Synchronize[]

Other {customcontent} can be organized into Products however you want.  For example, you might create an EPEL (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux) product and add an "EPEL 7 x86_64" repository to it.

For more information about creating and packaging RPMs, see the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html-single/rpm_packaging_guide/[RPM Packaging Guide] in the Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise Linux documentation.

[[Importing_Content-Importing_Custom_SSL_Certificates]]
=== Importing {customssltitle} Certificates

Before you synchronize {customcontent} from an external source, you might need to import SSL certificates into your {customproduct}. This might include client certs and keys or CA certificates for the upstream repositories you want to synchronize.

If you require SSL certificates and keys to download RPMs, you can add them to {Project}.

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Content* > *Content Credentials*.
In the Content Credentials window, click *Create Content Credential*.
. In the *Name* field, enter a name for your SSL certificate.
. From the *Type* list, select *SSL Certificate*.
. In the *Content Credentials Content* field, paste your SSL certificate, or click *Browse* to upload your SSL certificate.
. Click *Save*.

[[Importing_Content-Creating_a_Custom_Product]]
=== Creating a {customproducttitle}

Use this procedure to create a {customproduct} that you can then add repositories to.
To use the CLI instead of the web UI, see the xref:cli-creating-a-custom-product_{context}[].

.Procedure

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Content* > *Products*, click *Create Product*.
. In the *Name* field, enter a name for the product.
{Project} automatically completes the *Label* field based on what you have entered for *Name*.
. Optional: From the *GPG Key* list, select the GPG key for the product.
. Optional: From the *SSL CA Cert* list, select the SSL CA certificate for the product.
. Optional: From the *SSL Client Cert* list, select the SSL client certificate for the product.
. Optional: From the *SSL Client Key* list, select the SSL client key for the product.
. Optional: From the *Sync Plan* list, select an existing sync plan or click *Create Sync Plan* and create a sync plan for your product requirements.
. In the *Description* field, enter a description of the product.
. Click *Save*.

[id="cli-creating-a-custom-product_{context}"]
.CLI procedure

To create the product, enter the following command:

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer product create \
--name "_My_Product_" \
--sync-plan "_Example Plan_" \
--description "_Content from My Repositories_" \
--organization "_My_Organization_"

[[Importing_Content-Creating_a_Custom_RPM_Repository]]
=== Adding {customrpmtitle} Repositories

Use this procedure to add {customrpm} repositories in {Project}.
To use the CLI instead of the web UI, see the xref:cli-adding-rpm-repositories_{context}[].

The Products window in the {Project} web UI also provides a *Repo Discovery* function that finds all repositories from a URL and you can select which ones to add to your {customproduct}.
For example, you can use the *Repo Discovery* to search `http://yum.postgresql.org/9.5/redhat/` and list all repositories for different Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions and architectures.
This helps users save time importing multiple repositories from a single source.

ifdef::satellite[]

.Support for {customrpmtitle}s

Red Hat does not support the upstream RPMs directly from third-party sites.
These RPMs are used to demonstrate the synchronization process.
For any issues with these RPMs, contact the third-party developers.

endif::[]

.Procedure

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Content* > *Products* and select the product that you want to use, and then click *New Repository*.
. In the *Name* field, enter a name for the repository.
{ProjectNameX} automatically completes the *Label* field based on what you have entered for *Name*.
. From the *Type* list, select the type of repository.
You can select either a repository for RPM files (`yum`), Docker images (`docker`), Files (`file`) or other. Note that if the `yum` content type is selected, you can restrict whether the repository is available to a host based on the host's architecture and OS version.
. Optional: From the *Restrict to Architecture* list, select the architecture. Ensure that *No restriction*, which is the default value, is selected to make the repository available to all hosts regardless of the architecture.
. Optional: From the *Restrict to OS Version* list, select the OS version. Ensure that *No restriction*, which is the default value, is selected to make the repository available to all hosts regardless of the OS version.
. In the *URL* field, enter the URL of the external repository to use as a source.
{Project} supports three protocols: `http://`, `https://`, and `file://`.
If you are using a `file://` repositories, you have to place it under `/var/lib/pulp/sync_imports/` directory.
. From the *Download Policy* list, select the type of synchronization {ProjectServer} performs. See xref:Importing_Content-Configuring_Download_Policies[]
. Ensure that the *Mirror on Sync* check box is selected.
This ensures that the content that is no longer part of the upstream repository is removed during synchronization.
. From the *Checksum* list, select the checksum type for the repository.
. Optional: If you want, you can clear the *Publish via HTTP* check box to disable this repository from publishing through HTTP.
. Optional: From the *GPG Key* list, select the GPG key for the product.
. Click *Save*.

Continue to xref:Importing_Content-Synchronizing_Repositories[] to sync the repository

[[Importing_Content-Selecting_Red_Hat_Repositories_to_Synchronize]]
=== Enabling Red{nbsp}Hat Repositories

If outside network access requires usage of an HTTP Proxy, configure a default HTTP Proxy for your server.  See {InstallingProjectDocURL}adding-a-default-http-proxy_{build}[Adding a default HTTP Proxy]

To select the repositories to synchronize, you must first identify the product that contains the repository, and then enable that repository based on the relevant release version and base architecture.
For Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise Linux 8, you must enable both AppStream and BaseOS repositories.

ifdef::satellite[]
.Disconnected {Project}
If you use Disconnected {ProjectServer}, you must configure {Project} to synchronize content with a local CDN server before synchronizing content.
For more information, see xref:configuring-satellite-to-synchronize-content-with-a-local-cdn-server_content-management[].
endif::[]

.Repository Versioning
The difference between associating Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise Linux operating system with either 7 Server repositories or 7._X_ repositories is that 7 Server repositories contain all the latest updates while Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise Linux 7._X_ repositories stop getting updates after the next minor version release.
Note that Kickstart repositories only have minor versions.

.For Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Clients

To provision Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise Linux 8 clients, you require the *Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise Linux 8 for x86_64 - AppStream (RPMS)* and *Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise Linux 8 for x86_64 - BaseOS (RPMs)* repositories.

.For Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Clients

To provision Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise Linux 7 clients, you require the *Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Server (RPMs)* repository.

.Procedure

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Content* > *Red{nbsp}Hat Repositories*.
. To find repositories, either enter the repository name, or toggle the *Recommended Repositories* button to the on position to view a list of repositories that you require.
. In the Available Repositories pane, click a repository to expand the repository set.
. Click the *Enable* icon next to the base architecture and release version that you want.

.CLI procedure

. To search for your product, enter the following command:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer product list --organization "_My_Organization_"
----
+
. List the repository set for the product:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer repository-set list \
--product "Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server" \
--organization "_My_Organization_"
----

[[Importing_Content-Configuring_Download_Policies]]
=== Download Policies Overview

{ProjectName} provides multiple download policies for synchronizing RPM content.
For example, you might want to download only the content metadata while deferring the actual content download for later.

{ProjectServer} has the following policies:

Immediate::
{ProjectServer} downloads all metadata and packages during synchronization.

On Demand::
{ProjectServer} downloads only the metadata during synchronization.
{ProjectServer} only fetches and stores packages on the file system when {SmartProxies} or directly connected clients request them.
This setting has no effect if you set a corresponding repository on a {SmartProxy} to *Immediate* because {ProjectServer} is forced to download all the packages.

The *On Demand* policy acts as a _Lazy Synchronization_ feature because they save time synchronizing content.
The lazy synchronization feature must be used only for `yum` repositories.
You can add the packages to Content Views and promote to life cycle environments as normal.

{SmartProxyServer} offers the following policies:

Immediate::
{SmartProxyServer} downloads all metadata and packages during synchronization.
Do not use this setting if the corresponding repository on {ProjectServer} is set to *On Demand* as {ProjectServer} is forced to download all the packages.

On Demand::
{SmartProxyServer} only downloads the metadata during synchronization.
{SmartProxyServer} fetches and stores packages only on the file system when directly connected clients request them.
When you use an *On Demand* download policy, content is downloaded from {ProjectServer} if it is not available on {SmartProxyServer}.

Inherit::
{SmartProxyServer} inherits the download policy for the repository from the corresponding repository on {ProjectServer}.

=== Changing the Default Download Policy

You can set the default download policy that {Project} applies to repositories that you create in all organizations.

Depending on whether it is a Red Hat or non-Red Hat {customrepo}, {Project} uses separate settings.
Changing the default value does not change existing settings.

.Procedure

To change the default download policy for repositories, complete the following steps:

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Administer* > *Settings*.
. Click the *Content* tab.
. Change the default download policy depending on your requirements:
+
* To change the default download policy for a Red Hat repository, change the value of the *Default Red Hat Repository download policy* setting.
ifdef::satellite[]
* To change the default download policy for a {customrepo}, change the value of the *Default Custom Repository download policy* setting.
endif::[]
ifndef::satellite[]
* To change the default download policy for a non-Red Hat {customrepo}, change the value of the *Default Custom Repository download policy* setting.

[[uploading-content-to-a-custom-rpm-repository]]
=== Uploading Content to {customrpmtitle} Repositories

You can upload individual RPMs and source RPMs to {customrpm} repositories.
You can upload RPMs using the {Project} web UI or the Hammer CLI.
You must use the Hammer CLI to upload source RPMs.

.Procedure

. In the {Project} web UI, click *Content* > *Products*.
. Click the name of the {customproduct}.
. In the *Repositories* tab, click the name of the {customrpm} repository.
. Under *Upload Package*, click *Browse...* and select the RPM you want to upload.

----
+
When the upload is complete, you can view information about a source RPM by using the commands `hammer srpm list` and `hammer srpm info --id _srpm_ID_`.

[[Importing_Content-Recovering_a_Repository]]
=== Recovering a Repository
In the case of repository corruption, you can recover it by using an advanced synchronization, which has three options:

Optimized Sync::
Synchronizes the repository bypassing RPMs that have no detected differences from the upstream RPMs.

Complete Sync::
Synchronizes all RPMs regardless of detected changes.
Use this option if specific RPMs could not be downloaded to the local repository even though they exist in the upstream repository.

Verify Content Checksum::
Synchronizes all RPMs and then verifies the checksum of all RPMs locally.
If the checksum of an RPM differs from the upstream, it re-downloads the RPM.
This option is relevant only for `yum` repositories.
Use this option if you have one of the following errors:

* Specific RPMs cause a `404` error while synchronizing with `yum`.

* `Package does not match intended download` error, which means that specific RPMs are corrupted.

.Procedure

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Content* > *Products*.
. Select the product containing the corrupted repository.
. Select the name of a repository you want to synchronize.
. To perform optimized sync or complete sync, select *Advanced Sync* from the *Select Action* menu.
. Select the required option and click *Sync*.
. To verify the checksum, click *Verify Content Checksum* from the *Select Action* menu. (optional)

.CLI procedure

. Obtain a list of repository IDs:

[[Importing_Content-Limiting_Synchronization_Speed]]

=== Limiting Synchronization Concurrency

By default each Repository Synchronization job can fetch up to 10 files at a time.  This can be adjusted on a per repository basis.

Increasing the limit may improve performance, but can cause the upstream server to be overloaded or start rejecting requests.  If you are seeing Repository syncs fail due to the upstream servers rejecting requests, you may want to try lowering the limit.

To do so from the CLI:

[options="nowrap" subs="verbatim,quotes"]

[[Importing_Content-Importing_a_Custom_GPG_Key]]
=== Importing a {customgpgtitle} Key

When clients are consuming signed {customcontent}, ensure that the clients are configured to validate the installation of RPMs with the appropriate GPG Key.  This helps to ensure that only packages from authorized sources can be installed.

Red Hat content is already configured with the appropriate GPG key and thus GPG Key management of Red Hat Repositories is not supported.

To use the CLI instead of the web UI, see the xref:cli-importing-a-gpg-key_{context}[].

Ensure that you have a copy of the GPG key used to sign the RPM content that you want to use and manage in {Project}. Most RPM distribution providers provide their GPG Key on their website. You can also extract this manually from an RPM:

. Download a copy of the version specific repository package to your client system:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
$ wget _http://www.example.com/9.5/example-9.5-2.noarch.rpm_
----
+
. Extract the RPM file without installing it:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
$ rpm2cpio _example-9.5-2.noarch.rpm_ | cpio -idmv
----

The GPG key is located relative to the extraction at `etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-_EXAMPLE-95_`.

.Procedure

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Content* > *Content Credentials* and in the upper-right of the window, click *Create Content Credential*.
. Enter the name of your repository and select *GPG Key* from the *Type* list.
. Either paste the GPG key into the *Content Credential Contents* field, or click *Browse* and select the GPG key file that you want to import.
+
If your {customrepo} contains content signed by multiple GPG keys, you must enter all required GPG keys in the *Content Credential Contents* field with new lines between each key, for example:

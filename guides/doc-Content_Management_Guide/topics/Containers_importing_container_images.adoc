= Importing Container Images

You can import container image repositories from Red Hat Registry or from other image registries.

This procedure uses repository discovery to find container images and import them as repositories.
For more information about creating a product and repository manually, see xref:Importing_Custom_Content[].

.Procedure

To import container image repositories and create or associate them with a product, complete the following steps:

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Content* > *Products* and click *Repo Discovery*.
. From the *Repository Type* list, select *Container Images*.
. In the *Registry to Discover* field, enter the URL of the registry to import images from.
. In the *Registry Username* field, enter the name that corresponds with your user name for the container image registry.
. In the *Registry Password* field, enter the password that corresponds with the user name that you enter.
. In the *Registry Search Parameter* field, enter any search criteria that you want to use to filter your search, and then click *Discover*.
. Optional: To further refine the *Discovered Repository* list, in the *Filter* field, enter any additional search criteria that you want to use.
. From the *Discovered Repository* list, select any repositories that you want to import, and then click *Create Selected*.
. Optional: If you want to create a product, from the *Product* list, select *New Product*.
. In the *Name* field, enter a product name.
. Optional: In the *Repository Name* and *Repository Label* columns, you can edit the repository names and labels.
. Click *Run Repository Creation*.
. When repository creation is complete, you can click each new repository to view more information.
. Optional: To filter the content you import to a repository, click a repository, and then navigate to *Limit Sync Tags*.
Click to edit, and add any tags that you want to limit the content that synchronizes to {Project}.
. Navigate to *Content* > *Products*  and select the name of your product.
. Select the new repositories and then click *Sync Now* to start the synchronization process.

To view the progress of the synchronization navigate to *Content* > *Sync Status* and expand the repository tree.

When the synchronization completes, you can click *Container Image Manifests* to list the available manifests.
From the list, you can also remove any manifests that you do not require.

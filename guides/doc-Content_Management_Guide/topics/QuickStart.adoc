== Syncing CentOS Stream to {Project}
This chapter outlines how you can manage Centos Streams {customcontent} of different types to {Project}. We will over the following steps.

* Create {customrepo} to mirror content from Centos Stream
* Synchronize the Content
* Setup `Activation Keys`
* Register Hosts to consume this content.
* Manage Hosts, install/update/or remove rpms on `Host` via `katello-agent`


== Create repositories to synchronize

The first step is to discover available repositories in the Centos Stream, then select the repositories to mirror and bundle into a {customproduct}.

.Procedure
. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Content* > *Products*
. Click *Repo Discovery*.
. In the *Repository Type* field, choose *Yum Repositories*.
. In the *URL to Discover* field, enter the Centos Stream URL `http://mirror.centos.org/centos/8-stream`.
. Click *Discover*.
. Select `/AppStream/x86_64/os/` and `/BaseOS/x86_64/os/` repositories.
. Click *Create Selected*. This will enable you to create the repositories. However before creation we need  to point this group of repositories to a new product.
. In the *Product* field choose *New Product*
. In the *Name* field enter *Centos Stream* or desired product name.
. Click *Run Repository Creation*. 

_Note_ while repo discovery provides a convenient way to enable/create multiple repositories in one go, you could manually create the product and repositories directly.

== Examine the generated entities

In this section we will examine the repositories we created.

. Navigate to *Content* > *Products*
. Select the *Centos Stream* product that we created.
. Notice the 2 repositories with names *AppStream x86_64 os* and *BaseOS x86_64 os*
. Click on *AppStream x86_64 os*. This should take you to the Repository Details page.
. Notice that the *Upstream URL* is set to `http://mirror.centos.org/centos/8-stream/AppStream/x86_64/os/` and the *Type* is set to *yum*


== Pull the content from upstream repository

In this section we will pull and the mirror the contents of the upstream centos repositories. This is accomplished by the *Synchronization* action.

. Navigate to *Content* > *Products*
. Select the *Centos Stream* product that we created.
. Notice the 2 repositories with names *AppStream x86_64 os* and *BaseOS x86_64 os*
. Click on *AppStream x86_64 os*. This should take you to the Repository Details page.
. Notice that the *Upstream URL* is set to `http://mirror.centos.org/centos/8-stream/AppStream/x86_64/os/` and the *Type* is set to *yum*
. Select both repositories
. Click *Sync Now*
. Examine the repository counts after sync.

== Create Activation Key

In this section  we will create an *Activation Key* that can be used to register a host to {Project}.

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Content* > *Activation keys* and click *Create Activation Key*.
. In the *Name* field, enter the name of the activation key.
. In the *Description* field, enter a description for the activation key.
. From the *Environment* list, select the *Library*.
. From the *Content View* list, select *Default Organization View*.
. Click *Save*.

. Click on the *Subscriptions* tab on the Activation Key's details page.
. Click on the *Add* tab. This should list a set of product subscriptions that would automatically apply when a host is registered to {Project}
. Select all the product subscriptions in the table.
. Click *Add Selected* to save.

== Registering a Centos Stream host to {Project}

Use this procedure to register an existing CentOS Stream host to {Project}

. Login to the Centos 8 host you wish register on your terminal.
. Download the consumer RPM for your {ProjectServer}.
. This is located in the `pub` directory on the {ProjectServer}'s web server.
For example, for a {ProjectServer} with the host name `{foreman-example-com}`, enter the following command on the host to register:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# rpm -Uvh _http://{foreman-example-com}_/pub/katello-ca-consumer-latest.noarch.rpm
----
+
This RPM installs the necessary certificates for accessing repositories on {ProjectServer} and configures Red Hat Subscription Manager to use the server's URL.
+
. On the host, enter the following command to register the host to {Project} using the activation key:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# subscription-manager register --activationkey="_My_Activation_Key_"  --org="_My_Organization_"
----
. After registration run the yum repolist commands to update `/etc/yum.repos.d/redhat.repo` and enable content from {ProjectServer}
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# yum repolist

repo id                                                           repo name
Default_Organization_Centos_Stream_AppStream_x86_64_os            AppStream x86_64 os
Default_Organization_Centos_Stream_BaseOS_x86_64_os               BaseOS x86_64
Uploading Enabled Repositories Report
----
. Check the `/etc/yum.repos.d/redhat.conf` and ensure that the appropriate repos have been enabled. You should be able to pull content from {ProjectServer}

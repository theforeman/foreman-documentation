==== Registering a CentOS Stream host to {Project}

Use the following procedure to register an existing CentOS Stream host to {Project}

. Log on to the Centos 8 host you want register.
. Download the consumer RPM for your {ProjectServer}.
. This is located in the `pub` directory on the {ProjectServer}'s web server.
For example, for a {ProjectServer} with the host name `{foreman-example-com}`, enter the following command on the host to register:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# rpm -Uvh _http://{foreman-example-com}_/pub/katello-ca-consumer-latest.noarch.rpm
----
+
This RPM installs the necessary certificates for accessing repositories on {ProjectServer} and configures Red Hat Subscription Manager to use the server's URL.
+
. On the host, enter the following command to register the host to {Project} using the activation key:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# subscription-manager register --activationkey="_My_Activation_Key_"  --org="_My_Organization_"
----
. After registration, enter the yum repolist command to update `/etc/yum.repos.d/redhat.repo` and enable content from {ProjectServer}.
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# yum repolist

repo id                                                           repo name

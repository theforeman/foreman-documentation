= Installing {ProjectServer}

When you install {ProjectServer} from a connected network, you can obtain packages and receive updates directly from the Red Hat Content Delivery Network.

NOTE: You cannot register {ProjectServer} to itself.

Use the following procedures to install {ProjectServer}, perform the initial configuration, and import subscription manifests.
For more information on subscription manifests, see {ContentManagementDocURL}Managing_Red_Hat_Subscriptions_content-management[Managing Red Hat Subscriptions] in _{ContentManagementDocTitle}_.

Use the following procedures to install {ProjectServer} and perform the initial configuration.

ifdef::foreman-el[]
On {EL}, you can install {Project} with or without the Katello plug-in.
If you are a new user, consider installing {Project} with the Katello plug-in.
endif::[]

Note that the {Project} installation script is based on Puppet, which means that if you run the installation script more than once, it might overwrite any manual configuration changes.
⁠
To avoid this and determine which future changes apply, use the `--noop` argument when you run the installation script.
This argument ensures that no actual changes are made.
Potential changes are written to `{installer-log-file}`.

Files are always backed up and so you can revert any unwanted changes.
For example, in the foreman-installer logs, you can see an entry similar to the following about Filebucket:

[options="wrap"]
----
/Stage[main]/Dhcp/File[/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf]: Filebucketed /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf to puppet with sum 622d9820b8e764ab124367c68f5fa3a1
----

You can restore the previous file as follows:

[options="wrap"]
----
# puppet filebucket -l \
restore /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf 622d9820b8e764ab124367c68f5fa3a1

== Configuring {ProjectServer}

Install {ProjectServer} using the `{foreman-installer}` installation script.

This method is performed by running the installation script with one or more command options.
The command options override the corresponding default initial configuration options and are recorded in the {Project} answer file.
You can run the script as often as needed to configure any necessary options.

NOTE: Depending on the options that you use when running the {Project} installer, the configuration can take several minutes to complete.

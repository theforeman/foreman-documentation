= Tools for Administration of {ProjectName}

{Project} supports multiple ways to administer and configure {ProjectName}.

== {ProjectWebUI} Overview

The {ProjectWebUI} is a user interface accessed from a browser that enables administrators to manage and monitor their {Project} infrastructure.

== Hammer CLI Overview

Hammer is a command-line tool to configure and manage a {ProjectServer} through CLI commands or automation in shell scripts. Hammer also provides an interactive shell. 

Benefits of using Hammer:

* Hammer supports creating shell scripts for basic task automation.
* Output from Hammer commands can be redirected to other tools.
* You can use the `--debug` option to test responses to API calls before applying them in a script, for example, `hammer --debug organization list`. Changes in the API are automatically reflected in Hammer, while scripts using the API directly have to be updated manually.

To issue Hammer commands, a user must have access to the system on which {ProjectServer} is running.

NOTE: The {ProjectWebUI} has development priority. Some features, especially newly introduced features, that are available through {ProjectWebUI} might not be available for Hammer.

In the background, each Hammer command first establishes a binding to the API, then sends a request. This can have performance implications when executing a large number of Hammer commands in sequence. In contrast, scripts that use API commands communicate directly with the Satellite API and they establish the binding only once.

== API Overview

The {ProjectServer} provides a Representational State Transfer (REST) API. The REST API is enables developers and administrators to write custom scripts and external applications that access the API over HTTP.

You can use the REST API to perform the following tasks:

* Integrate with enterprise IT systems.
* Integrate with third-party applications.
* Perform automated maintenance or error checking tasks.
* Automate repetitive tasks with scripts. 

Benefits of using REST API:

* Broad client support: Any programming language, framework, or system with support for HTTP protocol can use the API.
* Self-descriptive: Client applications require minimal knowledge of the {ProjectName} infrastructure because a user discovers many details at runtime.
* Resource-based model: The resource-based REST model provides a natural way to manage a virtualization platform. 
* Faster compared to Hammer scripts: Scripts that use API commands communicate directly with the {Project} API, which makes them faster than scripts based on Hammer commands.

IMPORTANT: API commands differ between versions of {Project}. As you prepare to upgrade {ProjectServer}, ensure that any scripts you use that contain {Project} API commands are up to date.

== Managing {Project} with Ansible

{ProjectName} supports integration with Ansible to help automate repetitive administration tasks. You can also use {Project} Ansible Collections to manage and automate many aspects of {Project}.

== Remote Execution Overview

{ProjectName} supports remote execution of commands on managed hosts. Using remote execution, you can perform various tasks on multiple systems simultaneously.

== Kickstart Workflow

You can use Kickstart to automate the installation process of a {ProjectName} or {SmartProxyServer} by creating a Kickstart file that contains all the information that is required for the installation.

When you run a {ProjectName} Kickstart script, the following workflow occurs:

. It specifies the installation location of a {ProjectServer} or a {SmartProxyServer}.
. It installs the predefined packages.
. It installs Subscription Manager.
. It uses Activation Keys to subscribe the hosts to {ProjectName}.
. It installs Puppet, and configures a `puppet.conf` file to indicate the {ProjectName} or {SmartProxy} instance.
. It enables Puppet to run and request a certificate.
. It runs user defined snippets.

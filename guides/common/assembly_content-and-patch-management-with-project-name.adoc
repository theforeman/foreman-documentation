= Content and Patch Management with {ProjectName}

[role="_abstract"]
{ProjectName} provides features for systematic application of content and patches to managed hosts in all life cycle stages. Read the following sections to learn how {ProjectName} simplifies content and patch management. For details on how to manage content with {Project}, see {ContentManagementDocURL}[_{ContentManagementDocTitle}_].

== Content Flow in {ProjectName}

Content in {ProjectName} flows from _external content sources_ to _{ProjectServer}_. The {ProjectServer} is the central component where you manage the content lifecycle. _{SmartProxyServers}_ then mirror the content to _managed hosts_.

*External Content Sources*:: The Red{nbsp}Hat Customer Portal is the primary source of software packages, errata, and container images.
In addition, you can use other supported content sources (Git repositories, Docker Hub, Puppet Forge, SCAP repositories) as well as your organization's internal data store.

*{ProjectServer}*:: On the {ProjectServer}, you plan and manage the content life cycle.

*{SmartProxyServers}*:: {SmartProxyServers} mirror content from {ProjectServer} to establish content sources in various geographical locations.

*Managed Hosts*:: Host systems are typically the recipients of content from {SmartProxyServers} in their location. Hosts can also be managed directly by {ProjectServer}.
Hosts can be physical or virtual.

== Content Views in {ProjectName}

Content Views allow you to create a deliberately curated subset of content for your hosts. You can use Content Views to define which software versions a particular environment or {SmartProxyServer} uses. For example, a _Production_ environment can use a Content View with older package versions, while a _Development_ environment might use a Content View with newer package versions.

A _Default Organization View_ is an application-controlled Content View for all content that is synchronized to {Project}.
Default Organization View useful if you want to register a host to {Project} and access content using a subscription, without manipulating content views and lifecycle environments.

You can combine Content Views to create Composite Content Views. For example, you can create a Content View for a repository of packages that an operating system requires and another Content View for a repository of packages that an application requires. But you can combine both Content Views into a single Composite Content Views for ease of management.

= Configuring Satellite Server with a Custom SSL Certificate

By default, Red{nbsp}Hat Satellite{nbsp}6 uses a self-signed SSL certificate to enable encrypted communications between Satellite{nbsp}Server, external Capsule{nbsp}Servers, and all hosts. If you cannot use a Satellite self-signed certificate, you can configure Satellite Server to use an SSL certificate signed by an external Certificate Authority.

To configure your Satellite{nbsp}Server with a custom certificate, complete the following procedures:

. xref:creating-a-custom-certificate_satellite[]
. xref:deploying-a-custom-ssl-certificate-to-satellite-server_satellite[]
. xref:deploying-a-custom-ssl-certificate-to-hosts_satellite[]
. If you have external Capsule{nbsp}Servers registered to Satellite Server, you must configure them with custom SSL certificates. For more information, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_satellite/{ProductVersion}/html/installing_capsule_server/installing-capsule-server#configuring-capsule-custom-server-certificate_capsule[Configuring Capsule Server with a Custom SSL Certificate] in _Installing Capsule Server_.

= Migrating from Internal {Project} Databases to External Databases

ifeval::["{build}" == "foreman"]
For Red Hat systems only.

When you install {ProjectName}, the *{foreman-installer}* command installs MongoDB and PostgreSQL databases on the same server as {Project}. If you are using the default internal databases but want to start using external databases to help with the server load, you can migrate your internal databases to external databases. Depending on your requirements, you can use external databases for either MongoDB or PostgreSQL database, or both.

To confirm whether your {ProjectServer} has internal or external databases, you can query the status of your databases:

For PostgreSQL, enter the following command:
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} service status --only postgresql
----

For MongoDB, enter the following command:
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} service status --only rh-mongodb34-mongod
----

// Known issue: need to explicitly include the section titles so that two xrefs in the same paragraph render correctly
Use xref:mongodb-as-an-external-database-considerations_{context}[MongoDB as an External Database Considerations] and xref:postgresql-as-an-external-database-considerations_{context}[PostgreSQL as an External Database Considerations] to decide if you want to use external databases for your {Project} deployment.

Red Hat does not provide support or tools for external database maintenance. This includes backups, upgrades, and database tuning. You must have your own database administrator to support and maintain external databases.

To migrate from the default internal databases to external databases, you must complete the following procedures:

. xref:preparing-a-host-for-external-databases_{context}[]. Prepare a {RHEL} 7 server to host the external databases.
. xref:installing-mongodb_{context}[]. Prepare MongoDB with user `pulp` owning the `pulp_database`
. xref:installing-postgresql_{context}[]. Prepare PostgreSQL with databases for {Project} and Candlepin and dedicated users owning them.
. xref:migrating-to-external-databases_{context}[]. Edit the parameters of `{foreman-installer}` to point to the new databases, and run `{foreman-installer}`.

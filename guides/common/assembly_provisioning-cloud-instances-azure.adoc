:CRname: Microsoft Azure Resource Manager

{ProjectName} can interact with Microsoft Azure Resource Manager, including creating new virtual machines and controlling their power management states. Only image-based provisioning is supported for creating Azure hosts.

For more information about Azure Resource Manager concepts, see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/[Azure Resource Manager documentation].

Note that {Project} does not support Azure Government.

.Prerequisites

include::modules/snip_common-compute-resource-prereqs.adoc[]
* Ensure that you have the correct permissions to create an Azure Active Directory application. For more information, see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal#required-permissions[Check Azure AD permissions] in the _Microsoft identity platform (Azure Active Directory for developers)_ documentation.
* You must create and configure an Azure Active Directory application and service principle to obtain Application or _client_ ID, Directory or _tenant_ ID, and Client Secret. For more information, see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal[Use the portal to create an Azure AD application and service principal that can access resources] in the _Microsoft identity platform (Azure Active Directory for developers)_ documentation.
* Optional: If you want to use Puppet with Azure hosts, navigate to *Administer* > *Settings* > *Puppet* and enable the `Use UUID for certificates` setting to configure Puppet to use consistent Puppet certificate IDs.
* Based on your needs, associate a `finish` or `user_data` provisioning template with the operating system you want to use. For more information about provisioning templates, see xref:provisioning-templates_provisioning[].
* Optional: If you want the virtual machine to use a static private IP address, create a subnet in {Project} with the *Network Address* field matching the Azure subnet address.

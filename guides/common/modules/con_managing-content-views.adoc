= Managing content views

{ProjectName} uses content views to allow your hosts access to a deliberately curated subset of content.
To do this, you must define which repositories to use and then apply certain filters to the content.
These filters include package filters, package group filters, errata filters, module stream filters, and container image tag filters.
You can use content views to define which software versions a particular environment uses.
For example, a _Production_ environment might use a content view containing older package versions, while a _Development_ environment might use a content view containing newer package versions.

Alternatively, a _Default Organization View_ is an application-controlled content view for all content that is synchronized to {Project}.
This type is useful if you want to register a host to {Project} and access content using a subscription, without manipulating content views and lifecycle environments.

Each content view creates a set of repositories across each environment, which {ProjectServer} stores and manages.
When you promote a content view from one environment to the next environment in the application lifecycle, the respective repository on {ProjectServer} updates and publishes the packages.

|===
| | Development | Testing | Production

| Content view version and contents | Version 2 {endash} _example_software_-1.1-0.{client-pkg-arch}.{client-pkg-ext} | Version 1 {endash} _example_software_-1.0-0.{client-pkg-arch}.{client-pkg-ext} | Version 1 {endash} _example_software_-1.0-0.{client-pkg-arch}.{client-pkg-ext}
|===

The repositories for Testing and Production contain the `_example_software_-1.0-0.{client-pkg-arch}.{client-pkg-ext}` package.
If you promote Version 2 of the content view from Development to Testing, the repository for Testing regenerates and then contains the `_example_software_-1.1-0.{client-pkg-arch}.{client-pkg-ext}` package:

|===
| | Development | Testing | Production

| Content view version and contents | Version 2 {endash} _example_software_-1.1-0.{client-pkg-arch}.{client-pkg-ext} | *Version 2 {endash} _example_software_-1.1-0.{client-pkg-arch}.{client-pkg-ext}* | Version 1 {endash} _example_software_-1.0-0.{client-pkg-arch}.{client-pkg-ext}
|===

This ensures systems are designated to a specific environment but receive updates when that environment uses a new version of the content view.

The general workflow for creating content views for filtering and creating snapshots is as follows:

. Create a content view.
. Add one or more repositories that you want to the content view.
. Optional: Create one or more filters to refine the content of the content view.
For more information, see xref:Content_Filter_Examples_{context}[].
. Optional: Resolve any package dependencies for a content view.
For more information, see xref:Resolving_Package_Dependencies_{context}[].
. Publish the content view.
. Optional: Promote the content view to another environment.
For more information, see xref:Promoting_a_Content_View_{context}[].
. Attach the content host to the content view.

ifdef::client-content-dnf[]
If a repository is not associated with the content view, the file `/etc/yum.repos.d/redhat.repo` remains empty and systems registered to it cannot receive updates.
endif::[]
ifdef::client-content-apt[]
If a repository is not associated with the content view, the file `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/rhsm.sources` remains empty and systems registered to it cannot receive updates.
endif::[]

Hosts can only be associated with a single content view.
To associate a host with multiple content views, create a composite content view.
For more information, see xref:Creating_a_Composite_Content_View_{context}[].

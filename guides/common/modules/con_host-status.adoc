[id="Host_Status_{context}"]
= Host status in {Project}

[role="_abstract"]
In {Project}, each host has a global status that indicates which hosts need attention.
Each host also has sub-statuses that represent status of a particular feature.
With any change of a sub-status, the global status is recalculated and the result is determined by statuses of all sub-statuses.

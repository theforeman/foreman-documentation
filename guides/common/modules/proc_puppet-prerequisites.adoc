= Prerequisites for Puppet

There are four requirements to run the Puppet agent on managed hosts:

. Sync the Puppet agent from https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/6.21/install_puppet.html#enable_the_puppet_platform_repository[puppet.com].
For example, https://yum.puppet.com/puppet6/el/7/x86_64/[Puppet 6 for CentOS 7 on x86_64] or https://apt.puppet.com/[Puppet 6 for Ubuntu 20.04] with release `focal`, component `puppet6`, and architecture `amd64`.
+
Manage these repositories by using products, sync plans, content views, composite content views, and lifecycle environments.
For more information, see {ContentManagementDocURL}basic-content-management-workflow[basic content management workflow] in the _Content Management Guide_.
. Provide the Puppet agent to the managed host using their activation key.
. Add either `enable-puppet5` or `enable-puppet6` as parameter to your host or host group.
Set the parameter type to `boolean` and its value to `true`.
. Set a Puppet environment, Puppet server, and Puppet CA when provisioning a host.

= Installing Puppet Agent during Host Provisioning

You can install Puppet Agent during the host provisioning process.

.Procedure
. Navigate to *Hosts > Provisioning Templates*.
. Select a provisioning template depending on your host provisioning method.
For more information, see {ProvisioningDocURL}types-of-provisioning-templates_provisioning[Types of Provisioning Templates] in the _Provisioning_ guide.
. Ensure the `puppet_setup` snippet is included as follows:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
<%= snippet 'puppet_setup' %>
----
. Enable Puppet using a host parameter for a single host or host group:
+
Add a host parameter named `enable-puppet6` as type boolean set to `true`.
. Optional: To install the Puppet Agent directly from https://yum.puppet.com/[yum.puppet.com], add a host parameter named `enable-puppetlabs-puppet6-repo` as type boolean set to `true`.

= Running {ProjectName} on Amazon Web Services

Use this guide to ensure that you make all the necessary preparations for installing {ProjectName} Server and {SmartProxies} in Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2).

Use the xref:Deployment_Scenarios[Deployment Scenarios] section to understand the different architecture setups that are available for {Project} and {SmartProxy} installation on AWS.

Use the xref:Prerequisites[Prerequisites] section to prepare your Red Hat and Amazon Web resources for the {ProjectName} installation.


.Subscriptions

Not all subscriptions are eligible to run in public cloud environments. For more information about subscription eligibility, see the https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/cloud-access#program-details[Cloud Access Page].
You can create additional organizations and then import additional manifests to the organizations. For more information, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_satellite/{ProductVersion}/html/content_management_guide/managing_organizations#Managing_Organizations-Creating_an_Organization[Creating an Organization] in the _Content Management Guide_.


== Use case considerations

Because Amazon Web Services is an image-only service, there are common {Project} use cases that do not work, or require extra configuration in an Amazon Web Service environment. If you plan to use {Project} on AWS, ensure that the use case scenarios that you want to use are available in an AWS environment.

=== Use Cases Known to Work

You can perform the following {ProjectName} use cases on AWS:

.Multi-homed {Project} and {SmartProxy}
If you want {Project} to use multiple interfaces with distinct host names, you must perform additional configuration of the {ProjectServer} and {Project} {SmartProxyServer} CA certificates. If you want to deploy {Project} in this configuration, contact Red Hat.

You must do this when {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer} has different internal and external DNS host names and there is no site-to-site VPN connection between the locations where you deploy {ProjectServer} and {SmartProxyServer}.

.On demand content sources
You can use the *On demand* download policy to reduce the storage footprint of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux server that runs {Project}. When you set the download policy to *On Demand*, content syncs to the {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer} when a content host requests it.

For more information, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_satellite/{ProductVersion}/html/content_management_guide/importing_red_hat_content[Importing Red Hat Content] in the _Content Management Guide_.

=== Use Cases that Do Not Work

In AWS, you cannot manage the DHCP. Because of this, most of {ProjectServer}’s kickstart and PXE provisioning models are unusable. This includes:

* PXE Provisioning
* Discovery and Discovery Rules
* ISO Provisioning methods.
** PXE-Less Discovery (iPXE)
** Per-host ISO
** Generic ISO
** Full-host ISO

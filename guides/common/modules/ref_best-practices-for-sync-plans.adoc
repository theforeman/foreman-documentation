= Best practices for sync plans

* Add sync plans to products and regularly synchronize content to avoid overly large changes in repositories.
Synchronize content rather more often than less often.
For example, setup a sync plan to synchronize content every day rather than only once a month.
* Automate the creation and update of sync plans by using a Hammer script or an {ansible-docs-url}[Ansible playbook].
* Distribute synchronization tasks over several hours to reduce the task load by creating multiple sync plans with *Custom Cron*.
* Use *Custom Cron* to specify recurring synchronization using cron expressions.

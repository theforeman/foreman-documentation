= Best practices for sync plans

* Add sync plans to products and regularly synchronize content to keep the load on {Project} low during synchronization.
Synchronize content rather more often than less often.
For example, setup a sync plan to synchronize content every day rather than only once a month.
* Automate the creation and update of sync plans by using a Hammer script or an {ansible-docs-url}[Ansible playbook].
* Distribute synchronization tasks over several hours to reduce the task load by creating multiple sync plans with the *Custom Cron* tool.

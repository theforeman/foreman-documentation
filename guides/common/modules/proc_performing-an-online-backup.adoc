.Risks associated with online backups
When you perform an online backup, most {Project} services remain running and usable.
Background workers are shut down to ensure consistent backups.
Operations that require background workers remain in pending state.
The backup process ensures that the Pulp data (`/var/lib/pulp`) is not altered during the backup.
Any changes to the Pulp data during the backup will result in restart of the backup process, taking additional time.
endif::[]

[WARNING]
====
Request other users of {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer} to save any changes and warn them that some {Project} services may be unavailable for the duration of the backup.
Ensure no other tasks are scheduled for the same time as the backup.
====

.Prerequisites
* Ensure that your backup location has sufficient available disk space to store the backup.

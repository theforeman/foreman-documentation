= Using iPXE to Reduce Provisioning Times

iPXE is an open-source network-boot firmware.
It provides a full PXE implementation enhanced with additional features, such as booting from an HTTP server.
For more information about iPXE, see link:https://ipxe.org[iPXE website].

You can use iPXE if the following restrictions prevent you from using PXE:

* A network with unmanaged DHCP servers.
* A PXE service that is unreachable because of, for example, a firewall restriction.
* A TFTP UDP-based protocol that is unreliable because of, for example, a low-bandwidth network.

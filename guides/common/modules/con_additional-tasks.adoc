= Additional tasks

This section provides a short overview of selected {Project} capabilities that can be used for automating certain tasks or extending the core usage of {Project}:

* *Discovering bare-metal hosts* – the {Project} Discovery plugin enables automatic bare-metal discovery of unknown hosts on the provisioning network.
These new hosts register themselves to {ProjectServer} and the Puppet agent on the client uploads system facts collected by Facter, such as serial ID, network interface, memory, and disk information.
After registration you can initialize provisioning of those discovered hosts.
For more information, see {ProvisioningDocURL}Creating_Hosts_from_Discovered_Hosts_provisioning[Creating Hosts from Discovered Hosts] in _{ProvisioningDocTitle}_.

* *Backup management* – backup and disaster recovery instructions, see {AdministeringDocURL}backing-up-{project-context}-server-and-{smart-proxy-context}_admin[Backing Up {ProjectServer} and {SmartProxyServer}] in _{AdministeringDocTitle}_.
Using remote execution, you can also configure recurring backup tasks on hosts.
For more information on remote execution see {ManagingHostsDocURL}Configuring_and_Setting_Up_Remote_Jobs_managing-hosts[Configuring and Setting up Remote Jobs] in _{ManagingHostsDocTitle}_.

* *Security management* – {Project} supports security management in various ways, including update and errata management, OpenSCAP integration for system verification, update and security compliance reporting, and fine grained role based authentication.
Find more information on errata management and OpenSCAP concepts in {ManagingHostsDocURL}[_{ManagingHostsDocTitle}_].

* *Incident management* – {Project} supports the incident management process by providing a centralized overview of all systems including reporting and email notifications.
Detailed information on each host is accessible from {ProjectServer}, including the event history of recent changes.

* *Scripting with Hammer and API* – {Project} provides a command line tool called Hammer that provides a CLI equivalent to the majority of web UI procedures.
In addition, you can use the access to the {Project} API to write automation scripts in a selected programming language.

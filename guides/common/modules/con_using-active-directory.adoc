This section shows how to use direct Active Directory (AD) as an external authentication source for {ProjectServer}.

[NOTE]
====
You can attach Active Directory as an external authentication source with no single sign-on support.
For more information, see xref:Using_LDAP_{context}[].

Direct AD integration means that {ProjectServer} is joined directly to the AD domain where the identity is stored.
The recommended setup consists of two steps:

* Enrolling {ProjectServer} with the Active Directory server as described in xref:Enrolling_Server_with_the_AD_Server_{context}[].
* Configuring direct Active Directory integration with GSS-proxy as described in xref:Configuring_Direct_AD_Integration_with_GSS_Proxy_{context}[].

= Security Content Automation Protocol

{Project} uses the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) to define security configuration policies.
For example, a security policy might specify that for hosts running {RHEL}, login via SSH is not permitted for the `root` account.
With {Project}, you can schedule compliance auditing and reporting on all managed hosts.

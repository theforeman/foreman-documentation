= Security Content Automation Protocol

{Project} uses the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) standard to define security policies.

SCAP is a framework of several specifications based on XML, such as checklists described in the Extensible Checklist Configuration Description Format (XCCDF) and vulnerabilities described in the Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL).
The specifications can be encapsulated as _data stream_ files.

Checklist items in XCCDF, also known as _rules_, express the desired configuration of a system item.
For example, you may specify that no one can log in to a host over SSH using the `root` user account.
Rules can be grouped into one or more _XCCDF profiles_, allowing multiple profiles to share a rule.

The OpenSCAP scanner tool evaluates system items on a host against the rules and generates a report in the Asset Reporting Format (ARF), which is then returned to {Project} for monitoring and analysis.

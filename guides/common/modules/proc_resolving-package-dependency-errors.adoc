= Resolving Package Dependency Errors

If there are package dependency errors during installation of {ProjectServer} packages, you can resolve the errors by downloading and installing packages from Red Hat Customer Portal.
For more information about resolving dependency errors, see the KCS solution https://access.redhat.com/solutions/262323[How can I use the yum output to solve yum dependency errors?].

If you have successfully installed the {Project} packages, skip this procedure.

.Procedure

. Go to the https://access.redhat.com/[Red Hat Customer Portal] and log in.
. Click *DOWNLOADS*.
. Click the Product that contains the package that you want to download.
. Ensure that you have the correct *Product Variant*, *Version*, and *Architecture* for your environment.
. Click the *Packages* tab.
. In the *Search* field, enter the name of the package.
. Click the package.
. From the *Version* list, select the version of the package.
. At the bottom of the page, click *Download Now*.
. Copy the package to the {Project} base operating system.
. On {ProjectServer}, change to the directory where the package is located:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# cd _/path-to-package/_
----

. Install the package locally:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# yum localinstall _package_name_
----

. Change to the directory where the {Project} ISO is mounted:
+
[options="nowrap"]
----
# cd /media/sat6/

If there are further package dependency errors, repeat this procedure.

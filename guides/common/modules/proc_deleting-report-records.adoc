= Deleting Report Records

Report records are created automatically in {Project}.
You can use the `foreman-rake reports:expire` command to remove reports at any time.
You can also use a cron job to schedule report record deletions at the set interval that you want.

By default, using the `foreman-rake reports:expire` command removes report records that are older than 90 days.
You can specify the number of days to keep the report records by adding the *days* option and add the number of days.

For example, if you want to delete report records that are older than seven days, enter the following command:

----
# foreman-rake reports:expire days=7
----

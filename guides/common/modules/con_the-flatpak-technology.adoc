= The Flatpak technology

Flatpak provides a sandbox environment for application building, deployment, distribution, and installation.

Applications that you launch using Flatpak have minimum access to the host system, which protects the system installation against third-party applications. 
Flatpak provides application stability regardless of the versions of libraries installed on the host system.

Flatpak applications are distributed from repositories called remotes. 
{Team} provides a remote with {Project} applications.  
Additionally, third-party remotes are available as well. 
{Team} does not support applications from third-party remotes.

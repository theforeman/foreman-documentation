= {SmartProxy} port and firewall requirements

The following tables indicate the destination port and the direction of incoming and outgoing traffic for {SmartProxyServers}.

[NOTE]
====
ICMP to Port 7 UDP and TCP must not be rejected, but can be dropped.
The DHCP {SmartProxy} sends an ECHO REQUEST to the Client network to verify that an IP address is free.
A response prevents IP addresses from being allocated.

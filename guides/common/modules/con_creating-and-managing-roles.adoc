Users in {Project} can have one or more roles assigned.
These roles are associated with permissions that enable users to perform specified administrative actions in {Project}.
Permission filters define the actions allowed for a certain resource type.

{Project} provides a set of predefined roles with permissions sufficient for standard tasks.
ifeval::["{context}" == "admin"]
For a list of these roles, see xref:Predefined_Roles_Available_in_{project-context}_{context}[].
endif::[]
You can also configure custom roles.

Apart from the administrator role, the following types of roles are common:

Roles related to applications or parts of infrastructure::
For example, roles for owners of {client-os} as the operating system as opposed to roles for owners of application servers and database servers.

Roles related to a particular stage of the software lifecycle::
For example, roles divided among the development, testing, and production phases, where each phase has one or more owners.

Roles related to specific tasks::
For example, role of a security manager or role of a license manager.

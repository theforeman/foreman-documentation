Users in {Project} can have one or more roles assigned.
These roles are associated with permissions that enable users to perform specified administrative actions in {Project}.
Permission filters define the actions allowed for a certain resource type.

{Project} provides a set of predefined roles with permissions sufficient for standard tasks.
ifeval::["{context}" == "admin"]
For a list of these roles, see xref:Predefined_Roles_Available_in_{project-context}_{context}[].
endif::[]
You can also configure custom roles.

[NOTE]
====
One of the predefined roles is the *Default role*.
{Project} assigns the *Default role* to every user in the system.
By default, the *Default role* grants only a limited set of permissions.
Be aware that if you add a permission to the *Default role*, every {Project} users will gain that permission.
Assigning a different role to a user does not remove the *Default role* from the user.
====

The following types of roles are commonly defined within various {Project} deployments:

Roles related to applications or parts of infrastructure::
For example, roles for owners of {client-os} as the operating system as opposed to roles for owners of application servers and database servers.

Roles related to a particular stage of the software lifecycle::
For example, roles divided among the development, testing, and production phases, where each phase has one or more owners.

Roles related to specific tasks::
For example, you can create a role for security managers and a role for license managers, depending on the specific tasks users need to be able to perform within your organization.

= Creating and Managing Roles

{Project} provides a set of predefined roles with permissions sufficient for standard tasks, as listed in xref:Predefined_Roles_Available_in_{project-context}_{context}[].
It is also possible to configure custom roles, and assign one or more permission filters to them.
Permission filters define the actions allowed for a certain resource type.
Certain {Project} plug-ins create roles automatically.

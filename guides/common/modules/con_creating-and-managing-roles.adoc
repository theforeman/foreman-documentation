= Creating and managing roles

[role="_abstract"]
Roles define a set of permissions and access levels.
Each role contains one on more _permission filters_ that specify the actions allowed for the role.
Actions are grouped according to the _Resource type_.
Once a role has been created, users and user groups can be associated with that role.
This way, you can assign the same set of permissions to large groups of users.

= Installing {SmartProxyServers}

By installing {SmartProxyServers}, you extend the reach and scalability of your {Project} deployment.
Setting up a {SmartProxyServer} registers the base operating system on which you are installing to {ProjectServer} and configures the new {SmartProxyServer} to provide the required services within your {Project} deployment.

You can install a {SmartProxyServer} in each of your geographic locations.
By assigning a {SmartProxy} to each location, you decrease the load on {ProjectServer}, increase redundancy, and reduce bandwidth usage.

[NOTE]
====
The maximum number of {SmartProxyServers} that {ProjectServer} can support has no fixed limit.
It was tested that a {ProjectServer} can support 17 {SmartProxyServers} with 2 vCPUs.
====

Decide what services you want to enable on each {SmartProxyServer}.
You can configure the DNS, DHCP, and TFTP services on one of your {SmartProxyServers} or you can use an external server to provide these services to your {SmartProxyServers}.

= DHCP service providers

{Project} can manage IP leases on a DHCP server by using {SmartProxy}. This management contains querying for available IP addresses, adding new reservations, and deleting existing reservations.
Note that {SmartProxy} cannot manage subnet declarations.

{SmartProxy} supports the following DHCP providers that you can use to integrate {Project} with your existing DHCP infrastructure or deploy a new one:

`dhcp_isc`:: Managing IP leases on an ISC dhcpd server by using the Object Management Application Programming Interface (OMAPI).
See xref:enabling-the-installer-managed-dhcp-service[].

`dhcp_remote_isc`:: Managing IP leases on a remote ISC dhcpd server by using OMAPI.
This provider requires that you share the leases over the network, for example, with NFS.
See xref:integrating-a-remote-isc-dhcp-server[].

`dhcp_infoblox`:: Managing IP leases on an Infoblox DHCP server.
See xref:integrating-infoblox-dhcp[].

ifndef::satellite[]
`dhcp_libvirt`:: Managing IP leases on a dnsmasq DHCP server by using the `libvirt` API.
See xref:integrating-dnsmas-dhcp-by-using-the-libvirt-api[].

ifdef::orcharhino[]
`dhcp_native_ms`:: Managing IP leases in Microsoft Active Directory.

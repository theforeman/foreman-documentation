= Running Salt

You can run arbitrary Salt functions, such as `salt.highstate`, using remote execution on one or more Salt Minions.
This applies all relevant Salt States on your managed hosts.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Monitor* > *Jobs* and click *Run job*.
** If you want to run Salt highstate, select *Salt* as *Job category* and *Salt Run state.highstate {endash} Salt default* as *Job template* and click *Next*.
** If you want to run a Salt function, select *Salt-Call* as *Job category* and *Salt Run function {endash} SSH default* as *Job template* and click *Next*.
+
In the *Function* field, enter the name of the function that you want to trigger, for example, `pillar.items` or `test.ping`.
. Select hosts on which you want to run the job.
If you do not select any hosts, the job will run on all hosts you can see in the current context.
. Click *Next*.
. Optional: To configure advanced settings for the job, fill in the *Advanced fields*.
To learn more about advanced settings, see {ManagingHostsDocURL}advanced-settings-in-the-job-wizard_managing-hosts[Advanced Settings in the Job Wizard] in _{ManagingHostsDocTitle}_.
. Click *Next*.
. Select *Immediate execution* to execute the job immediately and click *Next*.
. Review job details.
You have the option to return to any part of the job wizard and edit the information.
. Click *Run* to schedule the job for execution.

Alternatively, you can define recurrent actions using the native Salt way.
For example, you can schedule hourly `state.highstate` runs on individual Salt Minions by extending `/etc/salt/minion`:

----
schedule:
  highstate:
    function: state.highstate
    minutes: 60

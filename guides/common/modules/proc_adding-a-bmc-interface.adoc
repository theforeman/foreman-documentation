= Adding a Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) Interface

Use this procedure to configure a baseboard management controller (BMC) interface for a host that supports this feature.

.Prerequisites
* The `ipmitool` package is installed.
* You know the MAC address, IP address, and other details of the BMC interface on the host, and the appropriate credentials for that interface.
+
[NOTE]
====
You only need the MAC address for the BMC interface if the BMC interface is managed, so that it can create a DHCP reservation.
====

.Procedure
. Enable BMC on the {SmartProxy} server if it is not already enabled:
.. Configure BMC power management on {SmartProxyServer} by running the `{foreman-installer}` script with the following options:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-installer} --foreman-proxy-bmc=true \
--foreman-proxy-bmc-default-provider=ipmitool
----
.. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Infrastructure*{nbsp}>{nbsp}*{SmartProxies}*.
.. From the list in the *Actions* column, click *Refresh*.
The list in the *Features* column should now include BMC.
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Hosts*{nbsp}>{nbsp}*All hosts*.
. Click *Edit* next to the host you want to edit.
. On the *Interfaces* tab, click *Add Interface*.
. Select *BMC* from the *Type* list.
Type-specific configuration options are appended to the form.
. Specify the general interface settings.
The applicable configuration options are the same as for the physical interfaces described in xref:Adding_a_Physical_Interface_{context}[].
. Specify the configuration options specific to BMC interfaces:
* *Username* and *Password*: Specify any authentication credentials required by BMC.
* *Provider*: Specify the BMC provider.
. Click *OK* to save the interface configuration.
. Click *Submit* to apply the changes to the host.

= Creating Hosts on Proxmox

The Proxmox provisioning process provides the option to create hosts over a network connection or using an existing image.

For network-based provisioning, you must create a host to access either integrated {SmartProxy} or an external {SmartProxyServer} on a Proxmox virtual network, so that the host has access to PXE provisioning services.
The new host entry triggers the Proxmox node to create the virtual machine.
If the virtual machine detects the defined {SmartProxyServer} through the virtual network, the virtual machine boots to PXE and begins to install the chosen operating system.

.DHCP Conflicts
If you use a virtual network on the Proxmox node for provisioning, ensure that you select a virtual network that does not provide DHCP assignments.
This causes DHCP conflicts with {ProjectServer} when booting new hosts.

For image-based provisioning, use the pre-existing image as a basis for the new volume.

.Procedure

. From the *Deploy on* list, select your Proxmox compute resource.
. From the *Compute Profile* list, select a profile to use to automatically populate virtual machine-based settings.

. On the *Operating System* tab, confirm that all fields automatically contain values.
. Select the Provisioning Method that you want:
+
* For network-based provisioning, click *Network Based*.
* For image-based provisioning, click *Image Based*.

* For boot-disk provisioning, click *Boot disk based*.
endif::[]
ifndef::satellite[]
* If the `foreman_bootdisk` plug-in is installed and you want to use boot-disk provisioning, click *Boot disk based*.
endif::[]
. Click *Resolve* in *Provisioning templates* to check the new host can identify the right provisioning templates to use.
. Click the *Virtual Machine* tab and confirm that these settings are populated with details from the host group and compute profile.
Modify these settings to suit your requirements.

. On the *Parameters* tab, ensure that a parameter exists that provides an activation key.
If not, add an activation key.

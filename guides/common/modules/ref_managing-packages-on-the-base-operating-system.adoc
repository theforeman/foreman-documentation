[id="Managing_Packages_on_the_Base_Operating_System_{context}"]
= Managing packages on the base operating system of {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer}

{Project} provides the `{foreman-maintain} packages` command to install and update packages on the base operating system of your {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServers}.

[WARNING]
====
Installing and updating individual packages with `yum` is not supported.
While {Project} provides the `{foreman-maintain} packages unlock` command to bypass `{foreman-maintain} packages` and enable package management with `yum`, this can lead to package inconsistencies and compromise the stability of the system.
Always use `{foreman-maintain} packages` to manage packages.
====

After you install or update a package on the base operating system, running `{foreman-installer}` afterwards is required.
When you manage packages with `{foreman-maintain} packages`, the command automatically runs `{foreman-installer}` as well.
Note that this results in restarting some services on the base operating system.

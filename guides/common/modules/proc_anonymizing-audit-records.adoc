= Anonymizing Audit Records

You can use the `foreman-rake audits:anonymize` command to remove any user account or IP information while maintaining the audit records in the database.
You can also use a cron job to schedule anonymizing the audit records at the set interval that you want.

By default, using the `foreman-rake audits:anonymize` command anonymizes audit records that are older than 90 days.
You can specify the number of days to keep the audit records by adding the *days* option and add the number of days.

For example, if you want to anonymize audit records that are older than seven days, enter the following command:

----
# foreman-rake audits:anonymize days=7
----

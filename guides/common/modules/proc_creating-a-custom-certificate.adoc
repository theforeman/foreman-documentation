= Creating a Custom SSL Certificate for {ProductName}

ifeval::["{context}" == "{project-context}"]
Use this procedure to create a custom SSL certificate for {ProductName}.
If you already have a custom SSL certificate for {ProductName}, skip this procedure.
endif::[]

ifeval::["{context}" == "{smart-proxy-context}"]
On {ProjectServer}, create a custom certificate for your {ProductName}.
If you already have a custom SSL certificate for {ProductName}, skip this procedure.
endif::[]

When you configure {ProductName} with custom certificates, note the following considerations:

* You must use the Privacy-Enhanced Mail (PEM) encoding for the SSL certificates.
* You cannot use the same certificate for both {ProjectServer} and {SmartProxyServer}.
* The same Certificate Authority must sign certificates for {ProjectServer} and {SmartProxyServer}.

.Procedure

To create a custom SSL certificate, complete the following steps:

. To store all the source certificate files, create a directory that is accessible only to the `root` user.
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# mkdir /root/{context}_cert
----

. Create a private key with which to sign the Certificate Signing Request (CSR).
+
Note that the private key must be unencrypted.
If you use a password-protected private key, remove the private key password.
+
If you already have a private key for this {ProductName}, skip this step.
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# openssl genrsa -out `/root/{context}_cert/{context}_cert_key.pem` 4096
----

. Create the `/root/{context}_cert/openssl.cnf` configuration file for the Certificate Signing Request (CSR) and include the following content:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
[ req ]
req_extensions = v3_req
distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name
x509_extensions = usr_cert
prompt = no

[ req_distinguished_name ] <1>
C  = _Country Name (2 letter code)_
ST = _State or Province Name (full name)_
L  = _Locality Name (eg, city)_
O  = _Organization Name (eg, company)_
OU = _The division of your organization handling the certificate_
CN = _{context}.example.com_ <2>

[ v3_req ]
basicConstraints = CA:FALSE
keyUsage = digitalSignature, nonRepudiation, keyEncipherment, dataEncipherment
extendedKeyUsage = serverAuth, clientAuth, codeSigning, emailProtection
subjectAltName = @alt_names

[ usr_cert ]
basicConstraints=CA:FALSE
nsCertType = client, server, email
keyUsage = nonRepudiation, digitalSignature, keyEncipherment
extendedKeyUsage = serverAuth, clientAuth, codeSigning, emailProtection
nsComment = "OpenSSL Generated Certificate"
subjectKeyIdentifier=hash
authorityKeyIdentifier=keyid,issuer

[ alt_names ]
DNS.1 = _{context}.example.com_ <3>
----
<1> In the `[ req_distinguished_name ]` section, enter information about your organization.
ifeval::["{context}" == "{project-context}"]
<2> Set the certificate's Common Name `CN` to match the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of your {ProductName}.
To confirm a FQDN, on that {ProductName}, enter the `hostname -f` command.
This is required to ensure that the `katello-certs-check` command validates the certificate correctly.
endif::[]
ifeval::["{context}" == "{smart-proxy-context}"]
<2> Set the certificate's Common Name `CN` to match the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of your {ProductName} or a wildcard value `*`.
To confirm a FQDN, on that {ProductName}, enter the `hostname -f` command.
This is required to ensure that the `katello-certs-check` command validates the certificate correctly.
If you set a wildcard value, you must add the `-t {certs-proxy-context}` option when you use the `katello-certs-check` command.
endif::[]
<3> Set the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) `DNS.1` to match the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of your server.

. Generate the Certificate Signing Request (CSR):
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# openssl req -new \
-key _/root/{context}_cert/{context}_cert_key.pem_ \ <1>
-config _/root/{context}_cert/openssl.cnf_ \ <2>
-out _/root/{context}_cert/{context}_cert_csr.pem_ <3>
----
<1> Path to the private key.
<2> Path to the configuration file.
<3> Path to the CSR to generate.

. Send the certificate signing request to the Certificate Authority.
The same Certificate Authority must sign certificates for {ProjectServer} and {SmartProxyServer}.
+


When you submit the request, specify the lifespan of the certificate.
The method for sending the certificate request varies, so consult the Certificate Authority for the preferred method.
In response to the request, you can expect to receive a Certificate Authority bundle and a signed certificate, in separate files.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Hosts* > *Provisioning Setup* > *Installation Media*.
. Click *Create Medium* to create an installation medium entry.
. Enter a *Name* for the installation medium.
. Set the *Path* to the upstream URL `{client-debian-installation-medium-path}`.

Alternatively, you can also use a {DL} Mirror.
Note that synchronized content from {Project} does not work for two reasons: first, the `linux` and `initrd.gz` files are not synchronized; second, the `Release` file is not signed with the official {DL} GPG private key.
. Set the *Operating System Family* to `Debian`.
. Click *Submit* to save the installation medium to {Project}.

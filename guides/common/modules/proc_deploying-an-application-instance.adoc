For each {SmartProxyServer}, the Ansible playbook runs to configure all hosts.
The remote execution plug-in, which works host-based, is used to run the Ansible playbook on each {SmartProxyServer}.

The first host of the application instance runs the Ansible playbook.
The *configuration jobs* page shows the first host of each {SmartProxyServer} as target host.
The ACD component of {SmartProxy} starts an Ansible playbook which configures all hosts connected to this {SmartProxyServer}.

For each {SmartProxyServer}, the Ansible Playbook runs to configure all hosts.
The remote execution plugin, which works host-based, is used to run the Ansible Playbook on each {SmartProxyServer}.

The first host of the application instance runs the Ansible Playbook.
The *configuration jobs* page shows the first host of each {SmartProxyServer} as target host.
The ACD component of {SmartProxy} starts an Ansible Playbook which configures all hosts connected to this {SmartProxyServer}.

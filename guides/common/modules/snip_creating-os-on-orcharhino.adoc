[TIP]
====
You can use a script to add operating system entries to your {ProjectServer}.

On your {ProjectServer}, uncomment the operating systems and {project-client-name} that you want to add in `/etc/orcharhino-ansible/or_operating_systems_vars.yaml`, replace the default organization and location names, and run `/opt/orcharhino/automation/play_operating_systems.sh`.
For more information, see `/usr/share/orcharhino-ansible/README.md` on your {ProjectServer}.

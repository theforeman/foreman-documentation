Reboot these hosts after the upgrade has completed.

. Remove old repositories:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="attributes"]
----
# rm /etc/yum.repos.d/*
----

. Obtain the latest ISO files by following the {InstallingServerDisconnectedDocURL}downloading-the-binary-dvd-images_satellite[Downloading the Binary DVD Images] procedure in _{InstallingServerDisconnectedDocTitle}_.

. Create directories to serve as a mount point, mount the ISO images, and configure the `rhel8` repository by following the {InstallingServerDisconnectedDocURL}configuring-the-base-operating-system-with-offline-repositories_satellite[Configuring the base operating system with offline repositories] procedure in _{InstallingServerDisconnectedDocTitle}_.
+
Do not install or update any packages at this stage.

. Configure the {Project} {ProjectVersion} repository from the ISO file.

.. Copy the ISO file's repository data file for the {ProjectName} packages:
+
[options="nowrap"]
----
# cp /media/sat6/Satellite/media.repo /etc/yum.repos.d/satellite.repo
----

.. Edit the `/etc/yum.repos.d/satellite.repo` file:
+
----
# vi /etc/yum.repos.d/satellite.repo
----

... Change the default `InstallMedia` repository name to `{Project}-{ProjectVersion}`:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]

. Optional: Because of the lengthy upgrade time, use a utility such as `tmux` to suspend and reattach a communication session.
You can then check the upgrade progress without staying connected to the command shell continuously.
+
If you lose connection to the command shell where the upgrade command is running, you can see the logs in `{installer-log-file}` to check if the process completed successfully.

. Upgrade {foreman-maintain} to its next version:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} self-upgrade --maintenance-repo-label {Project}-Maintenance
----

. Use the health check option to determine if the system is ready for upgrade.
When prompted, enter the hammer admin user credentials to configure `{foreman-maintain}` with hammer credentials.
These changes are applied to the `/etc/foreman-maintain/foreman-maintain-hammer.yml` file.
+
[options="nowrap" subs="attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} upgrade check --whitelist="repositories-validate,repositories-setup"
----
+
Review the results and address any highlighted error conditions before performing the upgrade.
. Perform the upgrade:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} upgrade run --whitelist="repositories-validate,repositories-setup"
----
+
If the script fails due to missing or outdated packages, you must download and install these separately.

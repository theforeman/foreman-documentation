= Upgrading a disconnected {ProjectServer}

Upgrading a {ProjectServer} that is not connected to the Red{nbsp}Hat Content Delivery Network includes backing up the server, configuring the server with the latest ISO files, and running the upgrade.

include::snip_warning-maintain-config-noop.adoc[]

.Prerequisites
* If you synchronize content between your {ProjectServer}s by using exports, ensure that all your {ProjectServer}s are on the same {Project} version.
* If you have made manual edits to you DNS or DHCP configuration in the `/etc/zones.conf` or `/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf` files, ensure DNS and DHCP configuration management is disabled:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="attributes"]
----
# {foreman-installer} \
--foreman-proxy-dhcp-managed=false \
--foreman-proxy-dns-managed=false
----
+
This prevents the upgrade process from overwriting your DNS and DHCP configuration.

.Procedure
. Create a backup of your {ProjectServer}:
.. Stop all {Project} services:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} service stop
----
.. Take a snapshot or create a backup:
* On a virtual machine, take a snapshot.
* On a physical machine, create a backup.
+
.. Start all {Project} services:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} service start
----
. Remove old repositories:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="attributes"]
----
# rm /etc/yum.repos.d/*
----
. Obtain the latest ISO files by following the {InstallingServerDisconnectedDocURL}downloading-the-binary-dvd-images_satellite[Downloading the Binary DVD Images] procedure in _{InstallingServerDisconnectedDocTitle}_.

. Create directories to serve as a mount point, mount the ISO images, and configure the `rhel8` repository by following the {InstallingServerDisconnectedDocURL}configuring-the-base-operating-system-with-offline-repositories_satellite[Configuring the base operating system with offline repositories] procedure in _{InstallingServerDisconnectedDocTitle}_.
+
Do not install or update any packages at this stage.

. Configure the {Project} {ProjectVersion} repository from the ISO file.

.. Copy the ISO file's repository data file for the {ProjectName} packages:
+
[options="nowrap"]
----
# cp /media/sat6/Satellite/media.repo /etc/yum.repos.d/satellite.repo
----

.. Edit the `/etc/yum.repos.d/satellite.repo` file:
+
----
# vi /etc/yum.repos.d/satellite.repo
----

... Change the default `InstallMedia` repository name to `{Project}-{ProjectVersion}`:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
[{Project}-{ProjectVersion}]
----

... Add the `baseurl` directive:
+
[options="nowrap"]
----
baseurl=file:///media/sat6/Satellite
----

. Configure the {ProjectName} Maintenance repository from the ISO file.

.. Copy the ISO file's repository data file for {ProjectName} Maintenance packages:
+
[options="nowrap"]
----
# cp /media/sat6/Maintenance/media.repo /etc/yum.repos.d/satellite-maintenance.repo
----

.. Edit the `/etc/yum.repos.d/satellite-maintenance.repo` file:
+
[options="nowrap"]
----
# vi /etc/yum.repos.d/satellite-maintenance.repo
----

... Change the default `InstallMedia` repository name to `{Project}-Maintenance`:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
[{Project}-Maintenance]
----

.. Add the `baseurl` directive:
+
[options="nowrap"]
----
baseurl=file:///media/sat6/Maintenance/
----

. Upgrade the {foreman-maintain} utility to its latest version:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} self-upgrade --maintenance-repo-label {Project}-Maintenance
----
. Determine whether your system is ready for {Project} upgrade:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} upgrade check --whitelist="repositories-validate,repositories-setup"
----
+
Review the results and address any highlighted error conditions before performing the upgrade.
+
[NOTE]
====
The `{foreman-maintain} upgrade check` might prompt you for the Hammer admin user credentials.
These changes are applied to the `/etc/foreman-maintain/foreman-maintain-hammer.yml` file.
====
. Run the {ProjectServer} upgrade command.
Because of the lengthy upgrade time, consider using a utility such as `tmux`.
For more information, see xref:following_the_progress_of_the_upgrade_upgrading-disconnected[].
+
[options="nowrap" subs="attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} upgrade run --whitelist="repositories-validate,repositories-setup"
----
+
If the script fails due to missing or outdated packages, you must download and install these separately.
For more information, see {InstallingServerDisconnectedDocURL}resolving-package-dependency-errors_satellite[Resolving Package Dependency Errors] in _{InstallingServerDisconnectedDocTitle}_.

. If you have the OpenSCAP plugin installed, but do not have the default OpenSCAP content available, enter the following command.
+
[options="nowrap" subs="attributes"]
----
# foreman-rake foreman_openscap:bulk_upload:default
----

. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Configure* > *Discovery Rules*.
 Associate selected organizations and locations with discovery rules.

. Perform the following post-upgrade tasks to ensure your environment is adjusted to any changes applied during the upgrade.
.. If any of the templates you are using were created by cloning the default {Project} templates, verify whether the default templates changed during the upgrade.
If the default templates have changed, consider updating your custom templates as well to reflect these changes.
+
[NOTE]
====
If the default provisioning templates changed during the upgrade and your custom code is executed before or after the provisioning process, you can use custom provisioning snippets to avoid recreating cloned templates.
For more information about configuring custom provisioning snippets, see {ProvisioningDocURL}Creating_Custom_Provisioning_Snippets_provisioning[Creating Custom Provisioning Snippets] in _{ProvisioningDocTitle}_.
====
.. If your {Project} shows any discovered hosts, reboot them:
... In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Hosts* > *Discovered hosts*.
... Select *Any Organization* to display all discovered hosts.
... Reboot all discovered hosts.

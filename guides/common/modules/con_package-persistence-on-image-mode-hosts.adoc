= Package persistence on image mode hosts

[role="_abstract"]
Any packages installed on an image mode host after the host is booted are transient and lost after a reboot.

To persist packages on an image mode host, you can build a new container image that includes the necessary packages.
After upgrading the image mode host to this image, the new packages are installed permanently on the host.

You can view the persistence of installed packages on an image mode host by navigating to the host details in the {ProjectWebUI}, selecting *Content* > *Packages*, and checking the *Persistence* column.

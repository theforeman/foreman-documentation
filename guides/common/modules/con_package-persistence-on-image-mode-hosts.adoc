= Package persistence on image mode hosts

[role="_abstract"]
Any packages installed on an image mode host after the host is booted are transient and lost after a reboot.

You can view the persistence of installed packages on an image mode host by navigating to the host details in the {ProjectWebUI}, selecting *Content* > *Packages*, and checking the *Persistence* column.
In Hammer CLI, you can view the persistence by running `hammer host package list --host-id _My_Host_ID_ --fields ALL`.

To persist packages on an image mode host, you can build a new container image that includes the necessary packages.
After upgrading the image mode host to the new image, the new packages are installed permanently on the host.

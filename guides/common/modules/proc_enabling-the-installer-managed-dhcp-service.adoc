= Enabling the installer-managed DHCP service

If you do not have a DHCP server available in your network, you can use the installer-managed DHCP service. This feature enables you to provide a DHCP service with a low maintenance effort.

Perform the steps on the {Project} or {SmartProxyServer} that you want to configure to manage the DHCP service for the subnet.


.Prerequisites

* You know the following network information:
** The range of IP addresses the DHCP should manage
** The IP address of the default gateway in the subnet
** The IP addresses of the name servers for the subnet


.Procedure

. Backup the answer files:
+
[options="nowrap",subs="+quotes,attributes"]
....
# mkdir /root/backup-answer-files/
# cp -p /etc/foreman-installer/scenarios.d/*-answers.yml /root/backup-answer-files/
....

. Configure {Project} or {SmartProxy} as DHCP server:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-installer} \
--foreman-proxy-dhcp true \
--foreman-proxy-dhcp-managed true \
--foreman-proxy-dhcp-range "192.0.2.100 192.0.2.150" \
--foreman-proxy-dhcp-gateway 192.0.2.1 \
--foreman-proxy-dhcp-nameservers 192.0.2.2
----

. For each affected {SmartProxy}, update the configuration of that {SmartProxy} in the {ProjectWebUI}. See xref:associating-the-dhcp-service-with-a-subnet[].

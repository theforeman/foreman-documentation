= Configuring External Authentication

By using external authentication you can derive user and user group permissions from user group membership in an external identity provider.
When you use external authentication, you do not have to create these users and maintain their group membership manually on {ProjectServer}.
In case the external source does not provide email, it will be requested during the first login through {ProjectWebUI}.

.Important User and Group Account Information
All user and group accounts must be local accounts.
This is to ensure that there are no authentication conflicts between local accounts on your {ProjectServer} and accounts in your Active Directory domain.

Your system is not affected by this conflict if your user and group accounts exist in both `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/group` files.
For example, to check if entries for `puppet`, `apache`, `foreman` and `foreman-proxy` groups exist in both `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/group` files, enter the following commands:

[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# cat /etc/passwd | grep 'puppet\|apache\|foreman\|foreman-proxy'
# cat /etc/group | grep 'puppet\|apache\|foreman\|foreman-proxy'

.Scenarios for Configuring External Authentication
{ProjectName} supports the following general scenarios for configuring external authentication:

* Using _Lightweight Directory Access Protocol_ (LDAP) server as an external identity provider.
LDAP is a set of open protocols used to access centrally stored information over a network.
With {Project}, you can manage LDAP entirely through the {ProjectWebUI}.
For more information, see xref:Using_LDAP_{context}[].
Though you can use LDAP to connect to a {FreeIPA} or AD server, the setup does not support server discovery, cross-forest trusts, or single sign-on with Kerberos in {Project}'s web UI.
* Using a {FreeIPA} server as an external identity provider.
{FreeIPA} deals with the management of individual identities, their credentials and privileges used in a networking environment.
Configuration using {FreeIPA} cannot be completed using only the {ProjectWebUI} and requires some interaction with the CLI.
For more information see xref:Using_FreeIPA_{context}[].
* Using _Active Directory_ (AD) integrated with {FreeIPA} through cross-forest Kerberos trust as an external identity provider.
For more information see xref:Active_Directory_with_Cross_Forest_Trust_{context}[].
* Using {Keycloak} as an OpenID provider for external authentication to {Project}.
For more information, see xref:Configuring_Project_with_Keycloak_Authentication_keycloak-general[].
* Using {Keycloak} as an OpenID provider for external authentication to {Project} with TOTP.
For more information, see xref:Configuring_Keycloak_Authentication_with_TOTP_keycloak-totp[].

* Using {Keycloak} as an OpenID provider for external authentication to {Project} with {PIV} cards.
For more information, see xref:Configuring_Keycloak_Authentication_with_CAC_Cards_keycloak-cac-cards[].
endif::[]

As well as providing access to {ProjectServer}, hosts provisioned with {Project} can also be integrated with {FreeIPA} realms.
{ProjectName} has a realm feature that automatically manages the life cycle of any system registered to a realm or domain provider.

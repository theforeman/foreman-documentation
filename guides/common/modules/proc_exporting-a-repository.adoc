= Exporting a Repository

You can export the content of a repository in the Library environment of an organization from {ProjectServer}.
You can use this archive file to create the same repository in another {ProjectServer} or in another {ProjectServer} organization.

You can export the following content from {ProjectServer}:

* RPM repositories
* Kickstart repositories
* Ansible repositories
* file repositories

You cannot export Docker content
ifndef::satellite[]
nor DEB repositories
endif::[]
from {ProjectServer}.

The export contains the following data:

* Two JSON files containing repository metadata.
* One or more archive files containing the contents of the repository from the Library environment of the organization.

You need all the files, `tar.gz`, `toc.json` and `metadata.json`, to be able to import.

.Prerequisites

To export the contents of a repository, ensure that {ProjectServer} from which you want to export, meets the following conditions:

* Ensure that the export directory has enough free storage space to accommodate the export.
* Ensure that the `/var/lib/pulp/exports` directory has enough free storage space equivalent to the size of the repositories being exported for temporary files created during the export process.
* Ensure that you set download policy to *Immediate* for the repository within the Library lifecycle environment you export.
For more information, see xref:Download_Policies_Overview_{context}[].
* Ensure that you synchronize Products that you export to the required date.

.Export a Repository with Chunking

In many cases the exported content archive may be several gigabytes in size.
If you want to split it into chunks of smaller size, you can use the `--chunk-size-gb` argument in the export command and limit the size by an integer value in gigabytes.

. Export content into archive chunks of a limited size, such as 2 GB:

# hammer content-export complete repository \
--chunk-size-gb=_2_ \
--organization="_My_Organization_" \
--product="_My_Product_" \

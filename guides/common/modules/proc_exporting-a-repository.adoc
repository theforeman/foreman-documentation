= Exporting a Repository

You can export the content of a repository in the Library environment of an organization from {ProjectServer}.
You can use this archive file to create the same repository in another {ProjectServer} or in another {ProjectServer} organization.

You can export the following content from {ProjectServer}:

* Ansible repositories
* Kickstart repositories
* Yum repositories
* file repositories

You cannot export Docker content
ifndef::satellite[]
nor DEB repositories
endif::[]
from {ProjectServer}.

The export contains the following data:

* Two JSON files containing repository metadata.
* One or more archive files containing the contents of the repository from the Library environment of the organization.

You need all the files, `tar.gz`, `toc.json` and `metadata.json`, to be able to import.

.Prerequisites
* Ensure that the export directory has enough free storage space to accommodate the export.
* Ensure that the `/var/lib/pulp/exports` directory has enough free storage space equivalent to the size of all repositories that you want to export.
* Ensure that you set download policy to *Immediate* for the repository within the Library lifecycle environment you export.
For more information, see xref:Download_Policies_Overview_{context}[].
* Ensure that you synchronize products that you export to the required date.

.Procedure
. Export a repository using the product name and repository name:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer content-export complete repository \
--name="_My_Repository_" \
--product="_My_Product_"
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The size of the exported archive depends on the number and size of the packages within the repository.
If you want to split the exported archive into chunks, export your repository using the `--chunk-size-gb` argument to limit the size by an integer value in gigabytes, for example `---chunk-size-gb=_2_`.
====
. Optional: Verify that the exported archive is located in the export directory:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# ls -lh /var/lib/pulp/exports/_My_Organization_/Export-_My_Repository_/1.0/2022-09-02T03-35-24-00-00/

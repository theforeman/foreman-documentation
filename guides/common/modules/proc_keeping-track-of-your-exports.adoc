= Keeping Track of Your Exports

If you are exporting content to several disconnected {ProjectServer}s then using a `--destination-server` option provides a way to organize or maintain a record of what versions got exported to a given destination.
For more information, see xref:Examining_the_Exports_{context}[].

This option is available for all content-export operations.
You can use the `destination-server` to

* Query what was previously exported to a given destination.
* Generate incremental exports automatically to the given destination server.

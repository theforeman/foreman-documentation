= Kernel parameters for Discovery customization

Discovery uses a Linux kernel for the operating system and passes kernel parameters to configure the Discovery service.
These kernel parameters include the following entries:

fdi.cachefacts::
Number of fact uploads without caching.
By default, {Project} does not cache any uploaded facts.

fdi.countdown::
Number of seconds to wait until the text-user interface is refreshed after the initial discovery attempt.
This value defaults to 45 seconds.
Increase this value if the status page reports the IP address as `N/A`.

fdi.dhcp_timeout::
NetworkManager DHCP timeout.
The default value is 300 seconds.

fdi.dns_nameserver::
Nameserver to use for DNS SRV record.

fdi.dns_ndots::
`ndots` option to use for DNS SRV record.

fdi.dns_search::
Search domain to use for DNS SRV record.

fdi.initnet::
By default, the image initializes all network interfaces (value `all`).
When this setting is set to `bootif`, only the network interface it was network-booted from will be initialized.

fdi.ipv4.method::
By default, NetworkManager IPv4 method setting is set to `auto`.
This option overrides it, set it to `ignore` to disable the IPv4 stack.
This option works only in DHCP mode.

fdi.ipv6.method::
By default, NetworkManager IPv6 method setting is set to `auto`.
This option overrides it, set it to `ignore` to disable the IPv6 stack.
This option only works in DHCP mode.

fdi.ipwait::
Duration in seconds to wait for IP to be available in HTTP proxy SSL cert start.
By default, {Project} waits for 120 seconds.

fdi.nmwait::
`nmcli -wait` option for NetworkManager.
By default, `nmcli` waits for 120 seconds.

fdi.proxy_cert_days::
Number of days the self-signed HTTPS cert is valid for.
By default, the certificate is valid for 999 days.

fdi.pxauto::
To set automatic or semi-automatic mode.
If set to 0, the image uses semi-automatic mode, which allows you to confirm your choices through a set of dialog options.
If set to 1, the image uses automatic mode and proceeds without any confirmation.

fdi.pxfactname1, fdi.pxfactname2 ... fdi.pxfactnameN::
Use to specify custom fact names.

fdi.pxfactvalue1, fdi.pxfactvalue2 ... fdi.pxfactvalueN::
The values for each custom fact.
Each value corresponds to a fact name.
For example, `fdi.pxfactvalue1` sets the value for the fact named with `fdi.pxfactname1`.

fdi.pxip, fdi.pxgw, fdi.pxdns::
Manually configures IP address (`fdi.pxip`), the gateway (`fdi.pxgw`), and the DNS (`fdi.pxdns`) for the primary network interface.
If you omit these parameters, the image uses DHCP to configure the network interface.
You can add multiple DNS entries in a comma-separated
footnote:[NetworkManager expects `;` as a list separator but currently also accepts `,`.
For more information, see `man nm-settings-keyfile` and https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/grub/grub.html#Shell_002dlike-scripting[Shell-like scripting in GRUB]]
list, for example `fdi.pxdns=192.168.1.1,192.168.200.1`.

fdi.pxmac::
The MAC address of the primary interface in the format of `AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF`.
This is the interface you aim to use for communicating with {SmartProxyServer}.
In automated mode, the first NIC (using network identifiers in alphabetical order) with a link is used.
In semi-automated mode, a screen appears and requests you to select the correct interface.

fdi.rootpw::
By default, the `root` account is locked.
Use this option to set a root password.
You can enter both clear and encrypted passwords.

fdi.ssh::
By default, the SSH service is disabled.
Set this to `1` or `true` to enable SSH access.

fdi.uploadsleep::
Duration in seconds between facter runs.
By default, facter runs every 30 seconds.

fdi.vlan.primary::
VLAN tagging ID to set for the primary interface.
If you want to use tagged VLAN provisioning and you want the Discovery service to send a discovery request, add the following parameter to the Discovery snippet:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
fdi.vlan.primary=_My_VLAN_ID_
----

fdi.zips::
Filenames with extensions to be downloaded and started during boot.
For more information, see xref:Extending_the_Discovery_Image_{context}[].

fdi.zipserver::
TFTP server to use to download extensions from.
For more information, see xref:Extending_the_Discovery_Image_{context}[].

ifndef::orcharhino[]
net.ifnames and biosdevname::
Because network interface names are not expected to always be the same https://access.redhat.com/solutions/5984311[between major versions] of {RHEL},
ifdef::foreman-el,katello[]
or any other operating system being provisioned,
endif::[]
hosts can be created with incorrect network configurations.
You can disable the new naming scheme by a kernel command line parameter:

* For Dell servers, use the `biosdevname=1` parameter.
* For other hardware or virtual machines, use the `net.ifnames=1` parameter.
endif::[]

proxy.type::
The proxy type.
By default, this parameter is set to `foreman`, where communication goes directly to {ProjectServer}.
Set this parameter to `proxy` if you point to {SmartProxy} in `proxy.url`.

proxy.url::
The URL of the server providing the Discovery service.
By default, this parameter contains the `foreman_server_url` macro as its argument.
This macro resolves to the full URL of {ProjectServer}.
There is no macro for a {SmartProxy} URL.
You have to set a {SmartProxy} explicitly.
For example:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
proxy.url=https://_{smartproxy-example-com}_:{smartproxy_port} proxy.type=proxy
----
+
You can use an IP address or FQDN in this parameter.
Add a SSL port number if you point to {SmartProxy}.

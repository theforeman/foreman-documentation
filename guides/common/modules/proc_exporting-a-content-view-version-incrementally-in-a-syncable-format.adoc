= Exporting a content view version incrementally in a syncable format

Exporting complete content view versions can be a very costly operation in terms of system resources.
ifdef::orcharhino[]
The size of the exported content view versions depends on the number of products.
endif::[]
Content view versions that have multiple {RHEL} trees can occupy several gigabytes of space on {ProjectServer}.

In such cases, you can use *Incremental Export* to export only pieces of content that changed since the previous export.
Incremental exports typically result in smaller archive files than the full exports.

The example below targets the version `2.0` for export because the version `1.0` was exported previously.

.Procedure
. Create an incremental export:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer content-export incremental version \
--content-view="_My_Content_View_Name_" \
--organization="_My_Organization_" \
--version=2.0 \
--format=syncable
----
. Optional: View the exported content view:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# find /var/lib/pulp/exports/Default_Organization/view/2.0/2023-03-02T14-19-50-05-00/ -name "*.{client-pkg-ext}"
----

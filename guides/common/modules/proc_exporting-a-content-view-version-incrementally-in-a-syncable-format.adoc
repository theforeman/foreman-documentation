= Exporting a Content View Version Incrementally in a Syncable Format

Exporting complete versions can be a very expensive operation in terms of system resources.
ifdef::orcharhino[]
The size of the exported Content View versions depends on the number of products.
endif::[]
Content View versions that have multiple {RHEL} trees can occupy several gigabytes of space on {ProjectServer}.

In such cases, you can use *Incremental Export* to export only pieces of content that changed since the previous export.
Incremental exports typically result in smaller archive files than the full exports.

The example below targets the version `2.0` for export, because the version `1.0` was exported previously.

.Procedure
. Create an incremental export:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer content-export incremental version \
--content-view="_Content_View_Name_" \
--organization="_My_Organization_" \
--version=2.0 --format=syncable
----
. Optional: View the exported Content View:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# cd /var/lib/pulp/exports/Default_Organization/view/3.0/2023-03-02T14-19-50-05-00/
# find . -name *.rpm
./content/dist/layered/rhel8/x86_64/ansible/2/os/Packages/s/sshpass-1.06-3.el8ae.x86_64.rpm

= Key Terms in Application Centric Deployment

ACD::
ACD stands for _Application_ _Centric_ _Deployment_ and describes a new approach to provision and configure hosts based on the service they provide.

Ansible Playbooks::
xref:Ansible_Playbooks_{context}[] are the core of the application definition.
They connect the different services and provide a whole application with one click of a button.
These playbooks contain roles, which in turn contain tasks to properly configure hosts.

Application Definitions::
xref:Application_Definitions_{context}[] are blueprints of how to deploy an application and its services.

Application Instances::
xref:Application_Definitions_{context}[] are configured application definitions.
You can define how many hosts to deploy per service and choose unique host names.
You can create different configurations whether its a testing or production environment or its expected usage.
For example, deploying a wiki platform for 20 users might use the `1-small` compute profile, whereas hundreds of expected users might require the `3-large` compute profile.

Service::
A service is a type of host necessary to run an application.
For example, the _LAMP_ stack consists of three services: an https://httpd.apache.org/[Apache] webserver, a https://www.mysql.com/[MySQL] database, and https://www.php.net/[PHP] scripting language all running on Linux servers.

Host Groups::
Host groups are predefined sets of provisioning and configuration settings for a new host.

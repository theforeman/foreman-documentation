= Exporting a content view version incrementally

Exporting complete content view versions can be a very expensive operation in terms of system resources.
ifdef::orcharhino[]
The size of the exported content view versions depends on the number of products.
endif::[]
Content view versions that have multiple {RHEL} trees can occupy several gigabytes of space on {ProjectServer}.

In such cases, you can create an incremental export which contains only pieces of content that have changed since the last export.
Incremental exports typically result in smaller archive files than the full exports.

.Procedure
. Create an incremental export:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
$ hammer content-export incremental version \
--content-view="_My_Content_View_" \
--organization="_My_Organization_" \
--version="_My_Content_View_Version_"
----
include::snip_syncable-exports.adoc[]

.Next steps
* Optional: View the exported content view:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# find /var/lib/pulp/exports/_My_Organization_/_My_Exported_Content_View_/_My_Content_View_Version_/
----
* You can import your exported content view version into {ProjectServer}.

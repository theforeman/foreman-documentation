= Exporting a Content View Version Incrementally

Exporting complete versions can be a very expensive operation in terms of system resources.
ifdef::orcharhino[]
The size of the exported Content View versions depends on the number of products.
endif::[]
Content View versions that have multiple {RHEL} trees can occupy several gigabytes of space on {ProjectServer}.

In such cases, you can use *Incremental Export* to export only pieces of content that changed since the previous export.
Incremental exports typically result in smaller archive files than the full exports.

The example below targets the version `2.0` for export, because the version `1.0` was exported previously.

.Procedure
. Create an incremental export:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer content-export incremental version \
--content-view="_Content_View_Name_" \
--organization="_My_Organization_" \
--version=2.0
----
. Optional: View the exported Content View:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# ls -lh /var/lib/pulp/exports/_My_Organization_/view/2.0/2021-02-25T21-45-34-00-00/
----

= Exporting a content view version incrementally

Exporting complete content view versions can be a very costly operation in terms of system resources.
ifdef::orcharhino[]
The size of the exported content view versions depends on the number of products.
endif::[]
Content view versions that have multiple {RHEL} trees can occupy several gigabytes of space on {ProjectServer}.

In such cases, you can create an incremental export which contains only pieces of content that have changed since the last export.
Incremental exports typically result in smaller archive files than the full exports.

The example below targets the version `2.0` for export because the version `1.0` was exported previously.

.Procedure
. Create an incremental export:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer content-export incremental version \
--content-view="_My_Content_View_Name_" \
--organization="_My_Organization_" \
--version=2.0
----
include::snip_syncable-exports.adoc[]
. Optional: View the exported content view:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# find /var/lib/pulp/exports/_My_Organization_/view/_My_Content_View_Version_/
----

.Next steps
You can import your exported content view version into {ProjectServer}.

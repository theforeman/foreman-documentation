= Managing {customfiletypetitle} Content

In {Project}, you might require methods of managing and distributing SSH keys and source code files or larger files such as virtual machine images and ISO files.
To achieve this, {customproduct}s in {ProjectName} include repositories for {customfiletype}s.
This provides a generic method to incorporate arbitrary files in a product.

You can upload files to the repository and synchronize files from an upstream {ProjectServer}.
When you add files to a {customfiletype} repository, you can use the normal {Project} management functions such as adding a specific version to a Content View to provide version control and making the repository of files available on various {SmartProxyServer}s.
Clients must download the files over HTTP or HTTPS using `curl -O`.

You can create a file type repository in {ProjectServer} only in a {customproduct}, but there is flexibility in how you create the repository source.
You can create an independent repository source in a directory on {ProjectServer}, or on a remote HTTP server, and then synchronize the contents of that directory into {Project}.
This method is useful when you have multiple files to add to a {Project} repository.

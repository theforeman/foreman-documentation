.Procedure
. Create a product called `Salt`.
For more information, see {ContentManagementDocURL}Creating_a_Custom_Product_content-management[Creating a product].
. Create a repository within the _Salt_ product for each operating system supported by {Project} that you want to install the Salt Minion client software on.

ifdef::salt,client-content-dnf[]
For more information, see {ContentManagementDocURL}Adding_Custom_RPM_Repositories_content-management[Adding RPM repositories].

Add the operating system to the name of the repository, for example `Salt for {client-os} {client-os-major}`.
+
You can find the _upstream URL_ for the Salt packages on the https://repo.saltproject.io/[official Salt package repository].
The URL depends on both the Salt version and the operating system, for example `{client-salt-minion-repository-url}`.
. Synchronize the previously created products.
For more information, see {ContentManagementDocURL}Synchronizing_Repositories_content-management[Synchronizing repositories].
. Create a content view for each repository.
For more information, see {ContentManagementDocURL}Creating_a_Content_View_content-management[Creating a content view].
. Create a composite content view for each major version of each operating system to make the new content available.
For more information, see {ContentManagementDocURL}Creating_a_Composite_Content_View_content-management[Create a composite content view].
. Add each of your operating system specific Salt content views to your main composite content view for that operating system and version.
. Publish a new version of the composite content view from the previous step.
. Promote the content view from the previous step to your lifecycle environments as appropriate.
For more information, see {ContentManagementDocURL}Promoting_a_Content_View_content-management[Promoting a content view].
. Optional: Create activation keys for your composite content view and lifecycle environment combinations.

= Exporting a content view version

You can export a version of a content view to an archive file from {ProjectServer} and use this archive file to create the same content view version on another {ProjectServer} or on another {ProjectServer} organization.
{Project} exports composite content views as normal content views.
The composite nature is not retained.
On importing the exported archive, a regular content view is created or updated on your downstream {ProjectServer}.
The exported archive file contains the following data:

* A JSON file containing content view version metadata
* An archive file containing all the repositories included into the content view version

ifdef::client-content-dnf[]
You can only export Yum repositories, Kickstart files, and Docker content added to a version of a content view.
endif::[]
ifndef::client-content-dnf[]
You can only export Deb and Yum repositories, Kickstart files, and Docker content added to a version of a content view.
endif::[]
{Project} does not export the following content:

* Content view definitions and metadata, such as package filters.

.Prerequisites

To export a content view, ensure that {ProjectServer} where you want to export meets the following conditions:

* Ensure that the export directory has free storage space to accommodate the export.
* Ensure that the `/var/lib/pulp/exports` directory has free storage space equivalent to the size of the repositories being exported for temporary files created during the export process.
* Ensure that you set download policy to *Immediate* for all repositories within the content view you export.
For more information, see xref:Download_Policies_Overview_{context}[].
* Ensure that you synchronize Products that you export to the required date.
* Ensure that the user exporting the content has the `Content Exporter` role.

.To export a content view version
. List versions of the content view that are available for export:

# hammer content-view version list \
--content-view="_My_Content_View_" \
--organization="_My_Organization_"

---|----------|---------|-------------|-----------------------
ID | NAME     | VERSION | DESCRIPTION | LIFECYCLE ENVIRONMENTS

.Export a content view version
. Get the version number of desired version.
The following example targets version `1.0` for export.
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer content-export complete version \
--content-view="_Content_View_Name_" \
--version=1.0 \
--organization="_My_Organization_"
----
. Verify that the archive containing the exported version of a content view is located in the export directory:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# ls -lh /var/lib/pulp/exports/_My_Organization_/_Content_View_Name_/1.0/2021-02-25T18-59-26-00-00/
----

You require all three files, for example, the `tar.gz` archive file, the `toc.json` and `metadata.json` to import the content successfully.

.Export with chunking
In many cases, the exported archive content can be several gigabytes in size.
You might want to split it smaller sizes or chunks.
You can use the `--chunk-size-gb` option with in the `hammer content-export` command to handle this.
The following example uses the `--chunk-size-gb=2` to split the archives into `2 GB` chunks.

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer content-export complete version \
--chunk-size-gb=2 \
--content-view="_Content_View_Name_" \
--organization="_My_Organization_" \
--version=1.0
# ls -lh /var/lib/pulp/exports/_My_Organization_/view/1.0/2021-02-25T21-15-22-00-00/

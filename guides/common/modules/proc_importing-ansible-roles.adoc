= Importing Ansible Roles and Variables

You can import Ansible roles and variables from the `/etc/ansible/roles` directory on {Project} or on a {SmartProxy} that has Ansible enabled.
Ensure that the roles and variables that you import are located in the `/etc/ansible/roles` directory on all {SmartProxies} from where you want to use the roles.
Note that if some roles are not visible, it can be because some roles take longer to import than others.
.Procedure

. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Configure* > *Roles* and click the {SmartProxy} that contains the roles and variables that you want to import.
. Click *Submit*.

= Importing Ansible Roles and Variables

You can import Ansible roles and variables from the xref:Ansible-paths_{context}[] on {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxy} that has Ansible enabled.
Ensure that the roles and variables that you import are located in the xref:Ansible-paths_{context}[] on all {SmartProxies} from where you want to use the roles.
Note that if some roles are not visible, it can be because some roles take longer to import than others.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Configure* > *Roles*.
. Click *Import* to select the {SmartProxy} from which you want to import.
. Select the roles that you want to import.
. Click *Submit*.

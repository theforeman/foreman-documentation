= Creating Hosts with UEFI HTTP Boot Provisioning

You can provision hosts from {Project} using the UEFI HTTP Boot.
This is the only method with which you can provision hosts in IPv6 network.

To use the CLI instead of the {ProjectWebUI}, see the xref:cli-creating-hosts-with-uefi-http-boot-provisioning_{context}[].

.Prerequisites
* Ensure that you meet the requirements for HTTP booting.
For more information, see {PlanningDocURL}http-booting-requirements[HTTP Booting Requirements] in _Planning for {Project}_.

.Procedure
. On {SmartProxy} that you use for provisioning, update the `grub2-efi` package to the latest version:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# {package-install-project} grub2-efi
----
. Enable `foreman-proxy-http`, `foreman-proxy-httpboot`, and `foreman-proxy-tftp` features.
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# {installer-scenario} \
--foreman-proxy-httpboot true \
--foreman-proxy-http true \
--foreman-proxy-tftp true
----
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Hosts* > *Create Host*.
. In the *Name* field, enter a name for the host.
. Click the *Organization* and *Location* tabs and change the context to match your requirements.
. From the *Host Group* list, select a host group that you want to use to populate the form.
. Click the *Interface* tab, and on the host's interface, click *Edit*.
. Verify that the fields are populated with values.
Note in particular:
+
* The *Name* from the *Host* tab becomes the *DNS name*.
* {ProjectServer} automatically assigns an IP address for the new host.
+
. In the *MAC address* field, enter a MAC address of the host's provisioning interface.
This ensures the identification of the host during the PXE boot process.
. Ensure that {ProjectServer} automatically selects the *Managed*, *Primary*, and *Provision* options for the first interface on the host.
If not, select them.
. Click *OK* to save.
To add another interface, click *Add Interface*.
You can select only one interface for *Provision* and *Primary*.
. Click the *Operating System* tab, and verify that all fields contain values.
Confirm each aspect of the operating system.
. From the *PXE Loader* list, select *Grub2 UEFI HTTP*.
. Optional: Click *Resolve* in *Provisioning template* to check the new host can identify the right provisioning templates to use.
+
For more information about associating provisioning templates, see xref:creating-provisioning-templates_provisioning[].

. Click the *Parameters* tab, and ensure that a parameter exists that provides an activation key.
If not, add an activation key.
endif::[]
ifdef::foreman-el,katello[]
. If you use the Katello plugin, click the *Parameters* tab, and ensure that a parameter exists that provides an activation key.
If not, add an activation key.
endif::[]
. Click *Submit* to save the host details.
+
For more information about network interfaces, see {ManagingHostsDocURL}Adding_Network_Interfaces[Adding network interfaces].
. Set the host to boot in UEFI mode from network.
. Start the host.
. From the boot menu, select *Kickstart default PXEGrub2*.

This creates the host entry and the relevant provisioning settings.
This also includes creating the necessary directories and files for UEFI booting the bare metal host.
When you start the physical host and set its boot mode to UEFI HTTP, the host detects the defined DHCP service, receives HTTP endpoint of {SmartProxy} with the Kickstart tree and installs the operating system.

ifdef::satellite,orcharhino[]
When the installation completes, the host also registers to {ProjectServer} using the activation key and installs the necessary configuration and management tools from the {project-client-name} repository.
endif::[]

ifdef::foreman-el,katello[]
If you use the Katello plug-in, when the installation completes, the host also registers to {ProjectServer} using the activation key and installs the necessary configuration and management tools from the {project-client-name} repository.

ifndef::satellite[]
In {Project}, you can import Ansible roles to help with automation of routine tasks.
To enable the Ansible plug-in in {Project}, enter the following command:

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
  # {foreman-installer} --enable-foreman-plugin-ansible \
  --enable-foreman-proxy-plugin-ansible
----

endif::[]


Complete this procedure to configure your {Project} deployment to run Ansible roles.

.Procedure

. Add the roles to the `/etc/ansible/roles` directory on the {Project} and all {SmartProxies} from where you want to use the roles.
If you want to use custom or third party Ansible roles, ensure to configure an external version control system to synchronize roles between {Project} and {SmartProxies}.

. On all {SmartProxies} that you want to use to run Ansible roles on hosts, enable the Ansible plug-in:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# {installer-scenario-smartproxy} \
--enable-foreman-proxy-plugin-ansible true
----

. Distribute SSH keys to enable {SmartProxies} to connect to hosts using SSH.
For more information, see {ManagingHostsDocURL}ssh-keys-for-remote-execution-overview_managing-hosts[Distributing SSH Keys for Remote Execution] in the _Managing Hosts_ guide.
{Project} runs Ansible roles the same way it runs remote execution jobs.

. Import the Ansible roles into {Project}.

. Proceed to {ConfiguringAnsibleDocURL}using-ansible-roles_ansible[Using Ansible Roles to Automate Repetitive Tasks on Satellite Hosts] in _Configuring {Project} To Use Ansible_.

[NOTE]
====
You can attach {FreeIPA} as an external authentication source with no single sign-on support.

.Prerequisites
* The base operating system of {ProjectServer} must be enrolled in the {FreeIPA} domain by the {FreeIPA} administrator of your organization.

The examples in this chapter assume separation between {FreeIPA} and {Project} configuration.

However, if you have administrator privileges for both servers, you can configure {FreeIPA} as described in {RHELDocsBaseURL}9/html-single/installing_identity_management/index[Installing Identity Management] for _{RHEL} 9_.
See {RHELDocsBaseURL}8/html-single/installing_identity_management/index[Installing Identity Management Guide] for _{RHEL} 8_.

= Using {FreeIPA}

This section shows how to integrate {ProjectServer} with a {FreeIPA} server and how to enable host-based access control.

[NOTE]
====
You can attach {FreeIPA} as an external authentication source with no single sign-on support.
For more information, see xref:Using_LDAP_{context}[].

.Prerequisites
* The base operating system of {ProjectServer} must be enrolled in the {FreeIPA} domain by the {FreeIPA} administrator of your organization.

The examples in this chapter assume separation between {FreeIPA} and {Project} configuration.

However, if you have administrator privileges for both servers, you can configure {FreeIPA} as described in https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html-single/installing_identity_management/index[{RHEL} 8 Installing Identity Management Guide].

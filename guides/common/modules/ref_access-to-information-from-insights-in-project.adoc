You can view the information available for hosts from {Insights} from the {ProjectWebUI}.

To review information from {Insights} for your hosts, navigate to the following pages in the {ProjectWebUI}:

* Navigate to *{Insights}* > *Recommendations* where the vertical ellipsis next to the *Remediate* button provides a *View in {Insights}* link to the general recommendations page.
On each recommendation line, the vertical ellipsis provides a *View in {Insights}* link to the recommendation rule, and, if one is available for that recommendation, a *Knowledgebase article* link.

* For additional information, navigate to *Hosts* > *All Hosts*.
If the host has recommendations listed, click on the number of recommendations.
On the *{Insights}* tab, the vertical ellipsis next to the *Remediate* button provides a *Go To {Project} {Insights} page* link to information for the system, and a *View in {Insights}* link to host details on the console.

| *Subscription manager name registration fact strict matching* | No | If this is enabled, and `register_hostname_fact` is set and provided, registration looks for a new host by name only using that fact, and skips all hostname matching.

| *Content View Dependency Solving Default* | No | The default dependency solving value for new content views.
| *Host Duplicate DMI UUIDs* | [] | If hosts fail to register because of duplicate _Desktop Management Interface_ (DMI) UUIDs, add their comma-separated values here.

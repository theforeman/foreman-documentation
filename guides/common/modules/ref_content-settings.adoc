A smaller number may lead to longer sync times.
A larger number will increase dynflow load.

Managed resources linked to the host such as virtual machines and DNS records might also be deleted.
| *Subscription manager name registration fact* | | When registering a host using subscription-manager, force use the specified fact for the host name (in the form of `fact.fact`).
| *Subscription manager name registration fact strict matching* | No | If this is enabled, and `register_hostname_fact` is set and provided, registration looks for a new host by name only using that fact, and skips all hostname matching.

| *Expire soon days* | 120 | The number of days remaining in a subscription before you are reminded about renewing it.
| *Content View Dependency Solving Default* | No | The default dependency solving value for new content views.
| *Host Duplicate DMI UUIDs* | [] | If hosts fail to register because of duplicate _Desktop Management Interface_ (DMI) UUIDs, add their comma-separated values here.

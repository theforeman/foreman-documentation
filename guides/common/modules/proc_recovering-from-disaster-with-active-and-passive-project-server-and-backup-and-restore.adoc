= Recovering from disaster with active and passive server and backup and restore

If your active {ProjectServer} fails, activate your passive secondary server.

.Procedure
. Verify that the failed active server is powered off and that backups are no longer being synchronized to your passive server.
. Switch DNS records of the active server with the DNS records of the passive server.
This ensures that hosts remain connected and you do not need to re-register them.
. Assess the functionality of your new active {ProjectServer}.

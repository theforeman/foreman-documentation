= Authenticating Hammer using CLI options

If you do not have your {Project} credentials saved in the `~/.hammer/cli.modules.d/foreman.yml` configuration file, hammer prompts you for them each time you enter a command.
You can specify your credentials when executing a command as follows:

[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
$ hammer -u _username_ -p _password_ _subcommands_
----

[NOTE]
====
Examples in this guide assume that you have saved credentials in the configuration file, or are using a hammer authentication session.

. In the *Name* field, enter a name for the profile.
. Click *Submit*. A new window opens with the name of the compute profile.
. In the new window, click the name of each compute resource and edit the attributes you want to set for this compute profile.

.For CLI Users

The compute profile CLI commands are not yet implemented in {ProjectName} {ProductVersion}.

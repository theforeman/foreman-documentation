= Creating Compute Profiles

You can use compute profiles to predefine virtual machine hardware details such as CPUs, memory, and storage.
A default installation of {ProjectName} contains three predefined profiles:

* `1-Small`
* `2-Medium`
* `3-Large`

You can apply compute profiles to all supported compute resources:

* xref:supported-cloud-providers_{context}[]
* xref:supported-virtualization-infrastructure_{context}[]

.Procedure

. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Infrastructure* > *Compute Profiles* and click *Create Compute Profile*.
. In the *Name* field, enter a name for the profile.
. Click *Submit*.
A new window opens with the name of the compute profile.
. In the new window, click the name of each compute resource and edit the attributes you want to set for this compute profile.

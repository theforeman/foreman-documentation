= Using Red{nbsp}Hat Insights with Hosts in {Project}

You can use Red{nbsp}Hat Insights to diagnose systems and downtime related to security exploits, performance degradation and stability failures.
You can use the dashboard to quickly identify key risks to stability, security, and performance.
You can sort by category, view details of the impact and resolution, and then determine what systems are affected.

To use Red{nbsp}Hat Insights to monitor hosts that you manage with {Project}, you must first install Red{nbsp}Hat Insights on your hosts and register your hosts with Red{nbsp}Hat Insights.

For new {Project} hosts, you can install and configure {Project} hosts with Insights during registration using the global registration template.
For more information, see {ManagingHostsDocURL}registering-a-host_managing-hosts[Registering a Host to {ProjectName} Using the Global Registration Template] in the _Managing Hosts_ guide.

To install and register your host using Puppet, or manually, see https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-insights/#getstarted[Red{nbsp}Hat Insights Getting Started].

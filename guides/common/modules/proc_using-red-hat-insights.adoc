= Using Red{nbsp}Hat Insights with Hosts in {Project}

You can use Red{nbsp}Hat Insights to diagnose systems and downtime related to security exploits, performance degradation and stability failures.
You can use the dashboard to quickly identify key risks to stability, security, and performance.
You can sort by category, view details of the impact and resolution, and then determine what systems are affected.

To use Red{nbsp}Hat Insights to monitor hosts that you manage with {Project}, you must first install Red{nbsp}Hat Insights on your hosts and register your hosts with Red{nbsp}Hat Insights.

For new {Project} hosts, you can install and configure {Project} hosts with Insights during registration using the global registration template.
For more information, see {ManagingHostsDocURL}Registering_Hosts_managing-hosts[Registering a Host to {ProjectName} Using the Global Registration Template] in _{ManagingHostsDocTitle}_.

To install and register your host using Puppet, or manually, see https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-insights/#getstarted[Red{nbsp}Hat Insights Getting Started].

.{Team} Insights Information Available for Hosts
Additional information is available about hosts through {Team} Insights.

You can find this information in two places:

* In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Configure > Insights* where the vertical ellipsis next to the *Remediate* button provides a *View in {Team} Insights* link to the general recommendations page.
On each recommendation line, the vertical ellipsis provide a *View in {Team} Insights* link to the recommendation rule, and, if one is available for that recommendation, a *Knowledgebase article* link.

* For additional information, navigate to *Hosts > All hosts*.
If the host has recommendations listed, click on the number of recommendations.
On the *Insights* tab, the vertical ellipsis next to the *Remediate* button provide a *Go To {Project} Insights page* link to information for the system, and a *View in {Team} Insights* link to host details on the console.

.Excluding hosts from rh-cloud and insights-client reports
You can set the `host_registration_insights` parameter to *False* to omit _rh-cloud_ and _insight-client_ reports.
{Project} will exclude the hosts from _rh-cloud_ reports and block _insight-client_ from uploading a report to the cloud.

You can also set this parameter at the organization, hostgroup, subnet, and domain level.
It automatically prevents new reports from being uploaded as long as they are associated with the entity.

If you set the parameter to false on a host that is already reported on the https://console.redhat.com/[Red Hat Hybrid Cloud], it will be still removed automatically from the inventory.
However, this process can take some time to complete.

.Deploying Red{nbsp}Hat Insights using the Ansible Role
You can automate the installation and registration of hosts with Red{nbsp}Hat Insights using the *RedHatInsights.insights-client* Ansible role.
For more information about adding this role to your {Project}, see {ManagingConfigurationsAnsibleDocURL}Getting_Started_with_Ansible_in_{project-context}_ansible[Getting Started with Ansible in {Project}] in _{ManagingConfigurationsAnsibleDocTitle}_.

. Add the *RedHatInsights.insights-client* role to the hosts.
+
For new hosts, see xref:Creating_a_Host_{context}[].
+
For existing hosts, see {ManagingConfigurationsAnsibleDocURL}Using_Ansible_Roles_to_Automate_Repetitive_Tasks_on_Clients_ansible[Using Ansible Roles to Automate Repetitive Tasks on Clients] in _{ManagingConfigurationsAnsibleDocTitle}_.
+
. To run the *RedHatInsights.insights-client* role on your host, navigate to *Hosts* > *All Hosts* and click the name of the host that you want to use.
. Click the *Run Ansible roles* button.

You must set up the API token for Insights before continuing.
For further information, see https://access.redhat.com/management/api[Red{nbsp}Hat API Tokens].

You can manually synchronize the recommendations using the following procedure:

. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Configure* *>* *Insights*.
. Click the *Start Recommendations Sync* button.

If you have not set up the API token, you are prompted to create one before using this page.

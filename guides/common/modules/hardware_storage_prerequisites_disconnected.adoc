= Storage Requirements and Guidelines

This section lists minimum storage requirements and provides storage guidelines for {ProjectServer} and {SmartProxyServer} installation.

== Storage Requirements

The following table details storage requirements for specific directories. These values are based on expected use case scenarios and can vary according to individual environments.

The runtime size was measured with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7, and 8 repositories synchronized.

== Storage Guidelines

Consider the following guidelines when installing {ProjectServer} to increase efficiency.


* Because most {Project} and {SmartProxyServer} data is stored within the `/var` directory, mounting `/var` on LVM storage can help the system to scale.

* Using the same volume for the `/var/cache/pulp/` and `/var/lib/pulp/` directories can decrease the time required to move content from `/var/cache/pulp/` to `/var/lib/pulp/` after synchronizing.

* Use high-bandwidth, low-latency storage for the `/var/lib/pulp/` and `/var/lib/mongodb/` directories. As {ProjectName} has many operations that are I/O intensive, using high latency, low-bandwidth storage causes performance degradation. Ensure your installation has a speed in the range 60 - 80 Megabytes per second. You can use the `fio` tool to get this data. See the Red{nbsp}Hat Knowledgebase solution https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3397771[Impact of Disk Speed on Satellite 6 Operations] for more information on using the `fio` tool.

* For improved performance, use solid state drives (SSD) rather than hard disk drives (HDD).

* The `/var/lib/qpidd/` directory uses slightly more than 2 MB per Content Host managed by the `goferd` service. For example, 10 000 Content Hosts require 20 GB of disk space in `/var/lib/qpidd/`.

.File System Guidelines

* Use the XFS file system for {ProjectNameX} because it does not have the inode limitations that `ext4` does. Because {Project} uses a lot of symbolic links it is likely that your system might run out of inodes if using `ext4` and the default number of inodes.

* Do not use NFS with MongoDB because MongoDB does not use conventional I/O to access data files and performance problems occur when both the data files and the journal files are hosted on NFS. If required to use NFS, mount the volume with the following options in the `/etc/fstab` file: `bg`, `nolock`, and `noatime`.

* Do not use NFS for Pulp data storage. Using NFS for Pulp has a negative performance impact on content synchronization.

* Do not use the GFS2 file system as the input-output latency is too high.

.Log File Storage

Log files are written to `/var/log/messages/,` `/var/log/httpd/`, and `/var/lib/foreman-proxy/openscap/content/`. You can manage the size of these files using *logrotate*. For more information, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/system_administrators_guide/s1-basic_configuration_of_rsyslog#s2-log_rotation[Log Rotation] in the System Administrator’s Guide.

The exact amount of storage you require for log messages depends on your installation and setup.

.SELinux Considerations for NFS Mount

When `/var/lib/pulp` directory is mounted using an NFS share, SELinux blocks the synchronization process. To avoid this, specify the SELinux context of the `/var/lib/pulp` directory in the file system table by adding the following lines to `/etc/fstab`:

----
nfs.example.com:/nfsshare  /var/lib/pulp/content  nfs  context="system_u:object_r:httpd_sys_rw_content_t:s0"  1 2
----

If NFS share is already mounted, remount it using the above configuration and enter the following command:

----
# chcon -R system_u:object_r:httpd_sys_rw_content_t:s0 /var/lib/pulp
----

.Duplicated Packages

Packages that are duplicated in different repositories are only stored once on the disk. Additional repositories containing duplicate packages require less additional storage. The bulk of storage resides in the `/var/lib/mongodb/` and `/var/lib/pulp/` directories. These end points are not manually configurable. Ensure that storage is available on the `/var` file system to prevent storage problems.

.Temporary Storage

The `/var/cache/pulp/` directory is used to temporarily store content while it is being synchronized. For content in RPM format, a maximum of 5 RPM files are stored in this directory at any time. After each file is synchronized, it is moved to the `/var/lib/pulp/` directory. Up to 8 RPM content synchronization tasks can run simultaneously by default, with each using up to 1 GB of metadata.


.ISO Images
For content in ISO format, all ISO files per synchronization task are stored in `/var/cache/pulp/` until the task is complete, after which they are moved to the `/var/lib/pulp/` directory.

If you plan to use ISO images for installing or updating, you must provide external storage or allow space in `/var/tmp` for temporarily storing ISO files.

For example, if you are synchronizing four ISO files, each 4 GB in size, this requires a total of 16 GB in the `/var/cache/pulp/` directory. Consider the number of ISO files you intend synchronizing because the temporary disk space required for them typically exceeds that of RPM content.

.Software Collections

Software collections are installed in the `/opt/rh/` and `/opt/theforeman/` directories.

Write and execute permissions by the root user are required for installation to the `/opt` directory.

.Symbolic links

You cannot use symbolic links for `/var/lib/pulp/` and `/var/lib/mongodb/`,

= Customizing registration by using snippets

You can customize the registration process without editing the *Global Registration* template by creating snippets that the template includes if they exist.
To add custom steps to registration, create one or both of the following snippets:

* `before_registration` {endash} This snippet will be loaded and executed by the *Global Registration* template at the beginning of registration.
* `after_registration` {endash} This snippet will be loaded and executed by the *Global Registration* template at the end of registration.

You have to name the snippets precisely.
Otherwise, they cannot be recognized.

.Prerequisites
* Your {Project} account has a role that grants the `view_provisioning_templates` and `create_provisioning_templates` permissions.
* You have to select a particular organization and location context.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Hosts* > *Templates* > *Provisioning Templates*.
. Click *Create Template*.
. In the *Name* field, enter the name of the required snippet.
. In the template editor, create your snippet.
. On the *Type* tab, select *Snippet*.
. Click *Submit*.

= Configuring Kerberos SSO for Active Directory users in {Project}

If the base system of your {ProjectServer} is connected directly to Active Directory (AD), you can configure AD as an external authentication source for {Project}.
Direct AD integration means that a Linux system is joined directly to the AD domain where the identity is stored.

AD users can log in using the following methods:

* Username and password
* Kerberos single sign-on

[NOTE]
====
You can also connect your {Project} deployment to AD in the following ways:

* By using indirect AD integration.
With indirect integration, your {ProjectServer} is connected to a {FreeIPA} server which is then connected to AD.
For more information, see xref:configuring-kerberos-sso-with-{Freeipa-context}-in-project_{context}[].
* By attaching the LDAP server of the AD domain as an external authentication source with no single sign-on support.
For more information, see xref:configuring-an-ldap-server-as-an-external-identity-provider-for-project_{context}[].

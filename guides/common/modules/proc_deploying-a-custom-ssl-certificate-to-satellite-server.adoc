[id="Deploying_a_Custom_SSL_Certificate_to_Server_{context}"]
= Deploying a Custom SSL Certificate to {ProjectServer}

Use this procedure to configure your {ProjectServer} to use a custom SSL certificate signed by a Certificate Authority.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not store the SSL certificates or .tar bundles in `/tmp` or `/var/tmp` directory.
The operating system removes files from these directories periodically.
As a result, `{foreman-installer}` fails to execute while enabling features or upgrading {ProjectServer}.

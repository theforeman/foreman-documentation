= Deploying a Custom SSL Certificate to {ProjectServer}

Use this procedure to configure your {ProjectServer} to use a custom SSL certificate signed by a Certificate Authority. The `katello-certs-check` command validates the input certificate files and returns the commands necessary to deploy a custom SSL certificate to {ProjectServer}.

.Procedure

To deploy a custom certificate on your {ProjectServer}, complete the following steps:

. Validate the custom SSL certificate input files. Note that for the `katello-certs-check` command to work correctly, Common Name (CN) in the certificate must match the FQDN of {ProjectServer}.

-b __/root/satellite_cert/ca_cert_bundle.pem__        <3>
----
<1> Path to the {ProjectServer} certificate file that is signed by a Certificate Authority.
<2> Path to the private key that was used to sign the {SmartProxyServer} certificate.
<3> Path to the Certificate Authority bundle.
+
If the command is successful, it returns two `{foreman-installer}` commands, one of which you must use to deploy a certificate to {ProjectServer}.

. From the output of the `katello-certs-check` command, depending on your requirements, enter the `{foreman-installer}` command that deploys a certificate to a new {Project} or updates a certificate on a currently running {Project}.
+
IMPORTANT: Do not delete the certificate archive file after you deploy the certificate. It is required, for example, when upgrading {ProjectServer}.

. On a computer with network access to {ProjectServer}, navigate to the following URL: `https://_{foreman.example.com}_`.

. In your browser, view the certificate details to verify the deployed certificate.

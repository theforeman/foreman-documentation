= Ansible variables for conversion

[role="_abstract"]
Before you run the Ansible role to generate conversion data, configure values of the following required Ansible variables.

{Project} imports most of the required Ansible variables from the `{ansible-namespace}.convert2rhel` role.
However, some variables are not imported.
These variables are marked with an asterisk `*` in the tables below.
You must create those additional variables manually and assign them to the `{ansible-namespace}.convert2rhel` role.

.Required variables for conversion
[cols="20%,5%,20%",options="header"]
|====
| Name | Type | Intent and value
| `{project-context}_server_url` * | string | URL of your {ProjectServer}, such as `\https://{foreman-example-com}`
| `{project-context}_username` * | string | Your user name
| `{project-context}_password` * | string | Your password
| `{project-context}_organization` * | string | Name of your organization
| `{project-context}_content_rhel_wait_for_syncs` * | boolean | Set to `false` if you do not want {ProjectServer} to wait until repository sync finishes before continuing with data generation. (default: `true`)
| `{project-context}_validate_certs` * | boolean | Set to `true` if you want to enable certificate checks in Ansible. (default: `true`)
| `{project-context}_convert2rhel_manage_subscription` | boolean | Set to `false` if you already have a manifest on your {ProjectServer}.
If you upload a new manifest from disk, the current manifest will be overwritten. (default: `true`)
| `{project-context}_content_rhel_enable_rhel7` * | boolean | Enables {RHEL} 7 repositories.
Set to `false` if you do not intend to convert hosts to {RHEL} 7. (default: `true`)
| `{project-context}_convert2rhel_enable_oracle7` | boolean | Set to `true` if you want to prepare conversion data for Oracle Linux 7.
Otherwise, you must set the value to `false`.
| `{project-context}_content_rhel_enable_rhel8` * | boolean | Enables {RHEL} 8 repositories.
Set to `false` if you do not intend to convert hosts to {RHEL} 8. (default: `true`)
| `{project-context}_convert2rhel_enable_oracle8` | boolean | Set to `true` if you want to prepare conversion data for Oracle Linux 8.
Otherwise, you must set the value to `false`.

.Optional variables for conversion
[cols="20%,5%,20%",options="header"]
|====
| Name | Type | Intent and value
| `{project-context}_manifest_path` * | string | Path to a manifest to upload from disk, such as `~/manifest.zip`.
You must set this path if you upload a new manifest from disk using `{project-context}_convert2rhel_manage_subscription`.
| `{project-context}_content_rhel_rhel8_releasever` * | string | Minor release version, such as `8.5`.
Set this variable if the minor release version of your system differs from the latest {RHEL} release to prevent conversion issues. (default: latest)

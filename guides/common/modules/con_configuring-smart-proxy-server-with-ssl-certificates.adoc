= Configuring {SmartProxyServer} with SSL certificates

[role="_abstract"]
{ProjectName} uses SSL certificates to enable encrypted communications between {ProjectServer}, {SmartProxyServers}, and all hosts.
Depending on the requirements of your organization, you must configure your {SmartProxyServer} with a default or custom certificate.

* If you use a default SSL certificate, you must also configure each {SmartProxyServer} with a distinct default SSL certificate.
For more information, see xref:configuring-capsule-default-certificate_{smart-proxy-context}[].
* If you use a custom SSL certificate, you must also configure each {SmartProxyServer} with a distinct custom SSL certificate.
For more information, see xref:configuring-capsule-custom-server-certificate_{smart-proxy-context}[].

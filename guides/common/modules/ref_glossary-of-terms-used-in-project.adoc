[[Activation_key]]
Activation key::
Activation keys are used by xref:Subscription-Manager[Subscription Manager] to register hosts to {Project}.
They define content view and lifecycle environment associations, content overrides, system purpose attributes, and other parameters to be associated with a newly created host.
+
// Reword when multi-CVs is part of Katello; see https://github.com/Katello/katello/pull/10296 and https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/35580
They are associated to exactly one lifecycle environment and exactly one content view, though this may be a composite content view.
You can use them on multiple machines and they behave like configuration information rather than traditional software license keys.
You can also use multiple activation keys with a single host.
When you register a host using an activation key, certain content from {Project} is provided to the host.
The content that is made available depends on the content in the activation key's content view and lifecycle environment, any content overrides present, any repository-level restrictions such as operating system or architecture, and system purpose attributes such as release version.

[[Compliance_policy]]
Compliance policy::
Compliance policies refer to the application of SCAP content to hosts by using {Project} with its OpenSCAP plugin.
You can create compliance policies by using the {ProjectWebUI}, Hammer CLI, or API.
A compliance policy requires the setting of a specific XCCDF profile from a SCAP content, optionally using a tailoring file.
You can set up scheduled tasks on {Project} that check your hosts for compliance against SCAP content.
When a compliance policy scan completes, the host sends an xref:ARF_report[ARF report] to {Project}.

[[Content]]
Content::
A general term for everything {Project} distributes to hosts.
Content includes software packages such as `.{client-pkg-ext}` packages, errata, or Docker images.
Content is synchronized into the Library and then promoted into lifecycle environments using content views so that they can be consumed by hosts.

[[Content_delivery_network_CDN]]
Content delivery network (CDN):: The mechanism used to deliver Red{nbsp}Hat content to {ProjectServer}.

[[Content_view]]
Content view::
Content views are named and versioned collections of repositories.
When you publish a content view, {Project} creates a new content view version.
This content view version is a frozen snapshot of the current state of the repositories within the content view.
Any subsequent changes to the underlying repositories will no longer affect the published content view version.
Once a content view is published, it can be promoted through the lifecycle environment path, or modified using incremental upgrades.

[[Composite_Content_View]]
Composite content view::
Composite content views contain content views, which allows for a more modular approach to manage and version content.
You can choose which version of each content view is used in a composite content view.

endif::[]

[[External_node_classifier_ENC]]
External node classifier (ENC)::
A construct that provides additional data for a server to use when configuring hosts.
When Puppet obtains information about nodes from an external source instead of its own database, the external source is called External node classifier.
If the Puppet plugin is installed, {ProjectName} can act as an External node classifier to Puppet servers in a {Project} deployment.

[[Facter]]
Facter:: A program that provides information (facts) about the system on which it is run; for example, Facter can report total memory, operating system version, architecture, and more.

ifdef::katello,orcharhino,satellite[]
[[Installation_Media]]
Installation Media::
Installation media are sets of installation files used to install the base operating system during the provisioning process.
An installation medium in {Project} represents the installation files for one or more operating systems, which must be accessible over the network, either through an URL or an NFS server location.
It is usually either a mirror or a CD or DVD image.
ifdef::orcharhino[]
Pointing the URL of the installation medium to a local copy, for example `http://{foreman-example-com}/pub/installation_media/`, can improve provisioning time and reduce network load.
endif::[]
+
Every operating system depends on exactly one path of an installation medium, whereas installation media paths may serve different operating systems at the same time.
You can use operating system parameters such as `$version`, `$major`, and `$minor` to parameterize the URL.

[[Lifecycle_environment]]
Lifecycle environment::
A lifecycle environment represents a step in the lifecycle environment path.
It defines the stage in which certain versions of content are available to hosts, such as _development_, _testing_, and _production_.

Content moves through lifecycle environments by publishing and promoting content views.

[[Lifecycle_environment_path]]
Lifecycle environment path::

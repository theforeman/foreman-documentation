= Backing Up {ProjectServer} and {SmartProxyServer}

You can back up your {Project} deployment to ensure the continuity of your {ProjectName} deployment and associated data in the event of a disaster.
If your deployment uses custom configurations, you must consider how to handle these custom configurations when you plan your backup and disaster recovery policy.

To create a backup of your {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer} and all associated data, use the `{foreman-maintain} backup` command.
Backing up to a separate storage device on a separate system is highly recommended.

{Project} services are unavailable during the backup.
Therefore, you must ensure that no other tasks are scheduled by other administrators.
You can schedule a backup using `cron`.
For more information, see the xref:Example_of_a_Weekly_Full_Backup_Followed_by_Daily_Incremental_Backups_{context}[].

During offline or snapshot backups, the services are inactive and {Project} is in a maintenance mode.
All the traffic from outside on port 443 is rejected by a firewall to ensure there are no modifications triggered.

A backup contains sensitive information from the `/root/ssl-build` directory.
For example, it can contain hostnames, ssh keys, request files and SSL certificates.
You must encrypt or move the backup to a secure location to minimize the risk of damage or unauthorized access to the hosts.

.Conventional Backup Methods
You can also use conventional backup methods.

[NOTE]
====
If you plan to use the `{foreman-maintain} backup` command to create a backup, do not stop {Project} services.
====

* When creating a snapshot or conventional backup, you must stop all services as follows:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} service stop
----
* Start the services after creating a snapshot or conventional backup:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} service start
----

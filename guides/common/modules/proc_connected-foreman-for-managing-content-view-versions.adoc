= Connected {ProjectServer} for managing Content View Versions

In this scenario, your connected {ProjectServer} is receiving content from an external source like the CDN.
The rest of your infrastructure is completely isolated, including a disconnected {ProjectServer}.
However, the connected {ProjectServer} is not only used as a content store, but also is used to manage content.
Updates coming from the CDN are curated into Content Views and Lifecycle Environments.
Once the content has been promoted to a designated Lifecycle Environment, the content can be exported and imported into the disconnected {ProjectServer}.

.On the connected {ProjectServer}
. Ensure that repositories are using the immediate download policy, either by:
.. For existing repos using *On Demand* change their download policy on the repository details page to *Immediate*.
.. For new repositories, ensure that the *Default Red Hat Repository download policy* setting is set to *Immediate* before enabling RH repos, and *Default download policy* is set to *Immediate* for custom repositories
see xref:Download_Policies_Overview[] for more information.
. Enable any content that you want to use (refer to xref:Enabling_Red_Hat_Repositories[].)
. Synchronize the enabled content.
. When you have new content republish the Content Views that include this content (see xref:Managing_Content_Views_{context}[].)
This should create a new Content View Version with the appropriate content to export.
. For the first export, perform a `complete version` export on the Content View Version that you want to export.
For more information see, xref:Exporting_a_Content_View_Version_{context}[].
This generates content archives that you can import into one or more disconnected {ProjectServer}s.
. Export all future updates in the connected {ProjectServer}s incrementally.
This generates leaner content archives that contain changes only from the recent set of updates.
For example, if your Content View has a new repository, this exported content archive  contains only the latest changes.
For more information on performing an incremental export on Content View Versions, see xref:Incremental-Export[].

.On the disconnected {ProjectServer}
. Copy the exported content archive from the connected {ProjectServer}.
. Import the content to the organization that you want.
For more information, see xref:Importing_a_Content_View_Version_{context}[].
This will create a content view version from the exported content archives and them import  content appropriately.

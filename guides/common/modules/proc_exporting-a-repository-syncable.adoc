* Update your CDN configuration to *Custom CDN*
* Set the CDN URL to point to the web server
* Optionally set a SSL CA Credential if the web server requires it
* Enable the Repository
* Synchronize the Repository.
endif::[]

You can use the generated content to create the same repository in another {ProjectServer} or in another {ProjectServer} organization via content import.
endif::[]

You can export the following content in a syncable format from {ProjectServer}:
* RPM repositories
* Kickstart repositories
* File repositories
You cannot export Ansible and Docker content.

= Adding a Red{nbsp}Hat subscription to {Project}

A Red{nbsp}Hat subscription manifest is a set of encrypted files that contains your subscription information.
{ProjectServer} uses this information to access the Red{nbsp}Hat CDN and find what repositories are available for the associated subscription.

[WARNING]

Deleting a subscription manifest removes all the subscriptions attached to running hosts and activation keys.

[id="Adding_a_Domain_to_Server_{context}"]
= Adding a Domain to {ProjectServer}

{ProjectServer} defines domain names for each host on the network.
{ProjectServer} must have information about the domain and {SmartProxyServer} responsible for domain name assignment.

.Checking for Existing Domains
{ProjectServer} might already have the relevant domain created as part of {ProjectServer} installation.
Switch the context to `Any Organization` and `Any Location` then check the domain list to see if it exists.

.DNS Server Configuration Considerations
During the DNS record creation, {Project} performs conflict DNS lookups to verify that the host name is not in active use.
This check runs against one of the following DNS servers:

* The system-wide resolver if *Administer*{nbsp}>{nbsp}*Settings* > *Query local nameservers* is set to *true*.
* The nameservers that are defined in the subnet associated with the host.
* The authoritative NS-Records that are queried from the SOA from the domain name associated with the host.

If you experience timeouts during DNS conflict resolution, check the following settings:

* The subnet nameservers must be reachable from {ProjectServer}.
* The domain name must have a Start of Authority (SOA) record available from {ProjectServer}.
* The system resolver in the `/etc/resolv.conf` file must have a valid and working configuration.

To use the CLI instead of the {ProjectWebUI}, see the xref:cli-adding-a-domain_{context}[].

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Infrastructure*{nbsp}>{nbsp}*Domains* and click *Create Domain*.
. In the *DNS Domain* field, enter the full DNS domain name.
. In the *Fullname* field, enter the plain text name of the domain.
. Click the *Parameters* tab and configure any domain level parameters to apply to hosts attached to this domain.
For example, user defined Boolean or string parameters to use in templates.
. Click *Add Parameter* and fill in the *Name* and *Value* fields.
. Click the *Locations* tab, and add the location where the domain resides.
. Click the *Organizations* tab, and add the organization that the domain belongs to.
. Click *Submit* to save the changes.

.CLI procedure
* Use the `hammer domain create` command to create a domain:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer domain create \
--description "_My_Domain_" \
--dns-id _My_DNS_ID_ \
--locations "_My_Location_" \
--name "_my-domain.tld_" \
--organizations "_My_Organization_"
----

In this example, the `--dns-id` option uses `1`, which is the ID of your integrated {SmartProxy} on {ProjectServer}.

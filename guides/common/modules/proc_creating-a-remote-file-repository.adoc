= Creating a Remote File Type Repository

You can create a {customfiletype} repository from a directory of files that is external to {ProjectServer} using the `pulp-manifest` command.
You can then synchronize the files into {ProjectServer} over HTTP or HTTPS.
When you add files to a file type repository, you can work with the files as with any other repository.

Use this procedure to configure a repository in a directory on a remote server.
To create a file type repository in a directory on the base system where {ProjectServer} is installed, see xref:Creating_a_Custom_File_Type_Repository_in_a_Local_Directory_{context}[].

.Prerequisites

Before you create a remote file type repository, ensure the following conditions exist:

* You have a {RHEL}{nbsp}7 server registered to your {Project} or the Red{nbsp}Hat CDN.
ifdef::satellite[]
* Your server has an entitlement to the {RHELServer} and {project-client-name} repositories.
endif::[]
* You have installed an HTTP server.
ifndef::orcharhino[]
For more information about configuring a web server, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/system_administrators_guide/ch-web_servers#s1-The_Apache_HTTP_Server[The Apache HTTP Server] in the {RHEL}{nbsp}7 _System Administrator's Guide_.
endif::[]

.Procedure

To create a file type repository in a remote directory, complete the following procedure:

ifdef::satellite[]
. On your machine, ensure that the right repositories are enabled.
** For {EL} 8:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# subscription-manager repos --enable={RepoRHEL8BaseOS} \
--enable={RepoRHEL8AppStream} \
--enable={RepoRHEL8ServerSatelliteUtils}
----
** For {EL} 7:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# subscription-manager repos --enable={RepoRHEL7Server} \
--enable={RepoRHEL7ServerSatelliteUtils}
----
endif::[]
. Install the Pulp Manifest package:
** For {EL} 8:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# dnf install python3-pulp_manifest
----
** For {EL} 7:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# yum tfm-pulpcore-python3-pulp_manifest
----
. Create a directory that you want to use as the file type repository in the HTTP server's public folder:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# mkdir /var/www/html/pub/__my_file_repo__
----
. Add files to the directory or create a test file:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# touch /var/www/html/pub/__my_file_repo/test.txt__
----
. Enter the Pulp Manifest command to create the manifest:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# pulp-manifest /var/www/html/pub/__my_file_repo__
----
. Verify the manifest was created:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# ls /var/www/html/pub/__my_file_repo__
PULP_MANIFEST test.txt
----

.Importing Files from a Remote a File Type Repository

To import files from a remote file type repository, complete the following procedure:

. Ensure a {customproduct} exists in {ProjectServer}, or create a {customproduct}.
For more information see xref:Creating_a_Custom_File_Type_Repository_{context}[]
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Content* > *Products*.
. Select the name of a product.
. Click the *Repositories* tab and select *New Repository*.
. In the *Name* field, enter a name for the repository.
{ProjectName} automatically completes this field based on what you enter for *Name*.
. From the *Type* list, select *file*.
. In the *Upstream URL* field, enter the URL of the upstream repository to use as a source.
. Select the *Verify SSL* checkbox if you want to verify that the upstream repository's SSL certificates are signed by a trusted CA.
. Optional: In the *Upstream Username* field, enter the user name for the upstream repository if required for authentication.
Clear this field if the repository does not require authentication.
. Optional: In the *Upstream Password* field, enter the corresponding password for the upstream repository.
Clear this field if the repository does not require authentication.
. Optional: In the *Upstream Authentication Token* field, provide the token of the upstream repository user for authentication.
Leave this field empty if the repository does not require authentication.
. From the *Mirroring Policy* list, select the type of content synchronization {ProjectServer} performs.
For more information, see xref:Mirroring_Policies_Overview_{context}[].
. Optional: In the *HTTP Proxy Policy* field, select the desired HTTP proxy.
The default value is `Global Default`.
. Optional: You can clear the *Unprotected* checkbox to require a subscription entitlement certificate for accessing this repository.
By default, the repository is published through HTTP.
. Optional: In the *GPG Key* field, select the GPG key for the repository.
. Optional: In the *SSL CA Cert* field, select the SSL CA Certificate for the repository.
. Optional: In the *SSL Client cert* field, select the SSL Client Certificate for the repository.
. Optional: In the *SSL Client Key* field, select the SSL Client Key for the repository.
. Click *Save*.
. To update the file type repository, navigate to *Content* > *Products*.
Select the name of a product that contains the repository that you want to update.
. In the product's window, select the name of the repository you want to update.
. From the *Select Action* menu, select *Sync Now*.

Visit the URL where the repository is published to view the files.

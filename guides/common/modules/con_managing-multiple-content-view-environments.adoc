= Managing multiple content view environments

You can manage multiple content views in different environments by organizing, promoting, and maintaining them effectively.

You can assign multiple content view environments to hosts from the server using Hammer or from the host using Subscription Manager. 
You can also view content view environment assignments, understand environment ordering and priority, and compare multiple content view environments with composite content views.

You also have the option to assign multiple content view environments to an activation key to give hosts access to content from each environment.
For more information about managing multiple content view environments with activation keys, see xref:Assigning_multiple_content_view_environments_to_activation_keys_{context}[].

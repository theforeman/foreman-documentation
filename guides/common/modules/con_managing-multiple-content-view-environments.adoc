= Managing multiple content view environments

You can assign hosts and activation keys to one or more content view environments instead of assigning lifecycle environments and content views separately.
A content view environment combines a specific lifecycle environment with a content view, streamlining the assignment process.
When you assign a host to multiple content view environments, the host gains access to the combined repositories from all its associated content view environments.

The `allow_multiple_content_views` setting controls whether hosts and activation keys can be assigned to multiple content view environments.
By default, this feature is disabled, limiting assignments to a single content view environment.
Enabling the setting allows you to assign multiple content view environments to both hosts and activation keys.
For more information on general settings, see {AdministeringDocURL}general_settings_information_[General settings] in _{AdministeringDocTitle}_.

When `allow_multiple_content_views` is enabled:

* Hosts and activation keys can be assigned to one or more content view environments.
* Hosts registered with multiple activation keys handle content view environment assignments based on the key order and settings configuration.

When `allow_multiple_content_views` is disabled:

* Existing multi-environment hosts continue to be assigned to multiple content view environments and retain access to all their content.
* Existing multi-environment activation keys remain associated with multiple content view environments.
* Multi-environment hosts and activation keys are still visible in the web UI and accessible through the Hammer CLI.
* Registration fails if you attempt to assign a host to multiple content view environments.
* Registration fails if you attempt to use a multi-environment activation key during host registration.
* Assigning multiple content view environments to a host or activation key results in an error.

When `allow_multiple_content_views` is disabled, it remains possible to:

* Reassign a multi-environment host to a single content view environment.
* Reassign a multi-environment activation key to a single content view environment or remove all content view environments from the key.

This setting provides flexibility in managing how content view environments are applied to hosts and activation keys while ensuring consistent behavior when disabled.

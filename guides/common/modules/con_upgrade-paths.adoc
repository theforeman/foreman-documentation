[NOTE]
====
Although upgrading the operating system of your {ProjectServer} and {SmartProxyServers} to {EL}{nbsp}9 is an optional part of the upgrade process, you will need to upgrade to {EL}{nbsp}9 before you can upgrade to the next {Project} version after {ProjectVersion}.

{SmartProxies} at version {ProjectVersionPrevious} will keep working with your upgraded {ProjectServer} {ProjectVersion}.
After you upgrade {ProjectServer} to {ProjectVersion}, you can upgrade your {SmartProxies} separately over multiple maintenance windows.

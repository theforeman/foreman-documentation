== Upgrade paths

You can upgrade to {ProjectName} {ProjectVersion} from {ProjectName} {ProjectVersionPrevious}.
For complete instructions on how to upgrade, see xref:Upgrading_{project-context}_{context}[].

The high-level steps in upgrading {Project} to {ProjectVersion} are as follows:

ifdef::satellite[]
. Ensure that your {ProjectServer}s and {SmartProxyServers} have been upgraded to {Project} {ProjectVersionPrevious}.
For more information, see {UpgradingPreviousDocURL}[_{UpgradingPreviousDocTitle}_] or {UpgradingDisconnectedPreviousDocURL}[_{UpgradingDisconnectedPreviousDocTitle}_].

{SmartProxies} at version {ProjectVersionPrevious} will keep working with your upgraded {ProjectServer} {ProjectVersion}.
endif::[]
ifndef::orcharhino[]
{SmartProxies} at version {ProjectVersionPrevious} and {ProjectVersionPrevious-Previous} will keep working with your upgraded {ProjectServer} {ProjectVersion}.

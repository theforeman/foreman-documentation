= Preparing {Project} for using external databases

By default, the {Project} installation process includes installing a PostgreSQL database on the same host as {ProjectServer}.
However, in certain {Project} deployments, using external databases instead of the default local databases can help with the server load or have other benefits.

.Procedure
* Install PostgreSQL on an external database host you prepared.

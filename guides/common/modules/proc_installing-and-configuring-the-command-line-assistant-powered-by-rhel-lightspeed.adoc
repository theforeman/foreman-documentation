= Installing and configuring the command-line assistant powered by RHEL Lightspeed

You can install the command-line assistant on your {RHEL} hosts and proxy the assistant traffic through your {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer}.

The command-line assistant powered by RHEL Lightspeed is an optional AI tool available within the RHEL command-line interface trained on Red Hat knowledge from Knowledge Centered Service (KCS) articles, RHEL documentation, and other Red{nbsp}Hat resources.
The command-line assistant provides you with interactive workflows to solve issues, implement new RHEL features, find information, and more.

You have several options how you can install the command-line assistant:

During host registration::
You can run the installation and configuration commands in a snippet that is executed after the host is registered by using global registration.
For more information, see xref:customizing-host-registration-by-using-snippets_{context}[].

REX-enabled registered hosts::
On hosts with remote execution (REX) enabled, you can run the installation and configuration commands by using a REX job, such as *Commands* / *Run Command*.

Manually::
You can run the installation and configuration commands on your host manually.

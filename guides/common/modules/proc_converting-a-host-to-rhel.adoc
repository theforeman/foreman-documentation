[id="converting-a-host-to-rhel"]
= Converting a host to {RHEL}

[role="_abstract"]
The *Convert2RHEL* utilities in {Project} contain an Ansible role and Ansible Playbook.
You use the Ansible role to generate conversion data on {ProjectServer}, which includes enabling required repositories and creating products, activation keys, and host groups.
Then you perform the actual conversion on the host by using the Ansible Playbook, which installs the Convert2RHEL CLI tool on the host and runs it.

.Prerequisites
* Review {RHELDocsBaseURL}8/html-single/converting_from_a_linux_distribution_to_rhel_using_the_convert2rhel_utility/index#con_supported-conversion-paths_converting-from-a-linux-distribution-to-rhel[Supported conversion paths] in _{RHEL}{nbsp}8 Converting from a Linux distribution to RHEL using the Convert2RHEL utility_.
* Ensure you have a subscription manifest uploaded to your {Project} and that there are sufficient {RHEL} entitlements allocated for the conversions you intend.
Alternatively, you can use Ansible variables to tell the role to import the manifest from disk.
The manifest must be imported to the organization to which you will register hosts for conversion.
+
You can update your allocations and download the updated manifest from the https://access.redhat.com[Red Hat Customer Portal].
For more information, see {RHDocsBaseURL}subscription_central/1-latest/html-single/creating_and_managing_manifests_for_a_connected_satellite_server/index#proc-exporting-downloading-manifest-satellite-connected[Exporting and downloading a manifest] in _Creating and managing manifests for a connected Satellite Server_.
* Ensure that you have enabled and synchronized Red Hat repositories in {Project} for the minor {RHEL} version to which you convert your hosts.
For more information, see {ContentManagementDocURL}Enabling_Red_Hat_Repositories_content-management[Enabling Red Hat Repositories] and {ContentManagementDocURL}Synchronizing_Repositories_content-management[Synchronizing Repositories] in _{ContentManagementDocTitle}_.

.Procedure
. Import the `{ansible-namespace}.convert2rhel` Ansible role and variables.
For more information, see {ManagingConfigurationsAnsibleDocURL}Importing_Ansible_Roles_and_Variables_ansible[Importing Ansible Roles and Variables] in _{ManagingConfigurationsAnsibleDocTitle}_.
. Configure Ansible variables for generation of conversion data.
For more information, see xref:ansible-variables-for-conversion_{context}[].
. Assign the `{ansible-namespace}.convert2rhel` role to the host that represents {ProjectServer}.
For more information, see {ManagingConfigurationsAnsibleDocURL}Assigning_Ansible_Roles_to_an_Existing_Host_ansible[Assigning Ansible Roles to an Existing Host] in _{ManagingConfigurationsAnsibleDocTitle}_.
. Run the Ansible role on {ProjectServer}.
For more information, see {ManagingConfigurationsAnsibleDocURL}running-ansible-roles-on-a-host_ansible[Running Ansible Roles on a Host] in _{ManagingConfigurationsAnsibleDocTitle}_.
+
The Ansible role generates data required for host conversion, that is, repositories, certificates, activation keys, and host groups.
The role enables the `{RepoRHEL7Server}` repository with the *7Server* release and *x86_64* architecture, or `{RepoRHEL8BaseOS}` and `{RepoRHEL8AppStream}`, or both, depending on which variables you have set in the previous steps.
. Register a host for conversion by using a generated host group.
+
Use the global registration template to register and subscribe your host before the conversion.
Select the host group that was generated for the conversion you intend, such as `CentOS 7 converting` if you convert the host from CentOS{nbsp}7.

. Run the pre-conversion analysis on the host group to verify if your hosts are ready for the conversion.
Execute a remote job with the following settings:
* **Job category**: `Convert 2 RHEL`
* **Job template**: `Convert2RHEL analyze`
* If you want to use an Extended Lifecycle Support add-on subscription, set the **ELS** option to `yes`.

+
For more information, see xref:executing-a-remote-job_{context}[].

+
Review pre-conversion analysis reports and resolve all issues that are blocking the conversion.
Repeat this step until you resolve all blocking issues.

. Run the Convert2RHEL playbook on the host group.
Execute a remote job with the following settings:
* **Job category**: `Convert 2 RHEL`
* **Job template**: `Convert to RHEL`
* **Activation key**:
** `convert2rhel_rhel7` if you convert to {RHEL} 7
** `convert2rhel_rhel8` if you convert to {RHEL} 8
* If you want to use an Extended Lifecycle Support add-on subscription, set the **ELS** option to `yes`.

[id="system-requirements_{context}"]

= System Requirements

The following requirements apply to the networked base system:

* x86_64 architecture
ifeval::["{context}" == "satellite"]
* The latest version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Server
endif::[]
* 4-core 2.0 GHz CPU at a minimum


ifeval::["{context}" == "satellite"]
* A minimum of 20 GB memory is required for {ProjectServer} to function. In addition, a minimum of 4 GB of swap space is also recommended. {Project} running with less memory than the minimum value might not operate correctly.
endif::[]

ifeval::["{context}" == "capsule"]
* A minimum of 12 GB memory is required for {SmartProxyServer} to function. In addition, a minimum of 4 GB of swap space is also recommended. {SmartProxy} running with less memory than the minimum value might not operate correctly.
endif::[]

* A unique host name, which can contain lower-case letters, numbers, dots (.) and hyphens (-)
* A current {ProjectName} subscription
* Administrative user (root) access
* A system umask of 0022
* Full forward and reverse DNS resolution using a fully-qualified domain name


Before you install {ProductName}, ensure that your environment meets the requirements for installation.

{ProductName} must be installed on a freshly provisioned system that serves no other function except to run {ProductName}. The freshly provisioned system must not have the following users provided by external identity providers to avoid conflicts with the local users that {ProductName} creates:

* postgres
* mongodb
* apache
* tomcat
* foreman
* foreman-proxy
* qpidd
* qdrouterd
* squid
* puppet

NOTE: The {ProjectName} Server and {SmartProxyServer} versions must match. For example, a {ProjectXY} Server cannot run a {ProductVersion} {SmartProxyServer} and a {Project} {ProductVersion} Server cannot run a 6.2 {SmartProxyServer}. Mismatching {ProjectServer} and {SmartProxyServer} versions results in the {SmartProxyServer} failing silently.

For more information on scaling your {SmartProxyServer}s, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_satellite/{ProductVersion}/html/installing_capsule_server/capsule_server_scalability[{SmartProxyServer} Scalability Considerations].

.Certified hypervisors
{ProductName} is fully supported on both physical systems and virtual machines that run on hypervisors that are supported to run Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise Linux. For more information about certified hypervisors, see https://access.redhat.com/certified-hypervisors[Which hypervisors are certified to run Red Hat Enterprise Linux?]

.FIPS Mode
You can install {ProductName} on a Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise Linux system that is operating in FIPS mode. For more information, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/security_guide/chap-federal_standards_and_regulations#sec-Enabling-FIPS-Mode[Enabling FIPS Mode] in the _Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise Linux Security Guide_.

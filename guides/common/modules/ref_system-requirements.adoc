[id="system-requirements_{context}"]

= System Requirements

The following requirements apply to the networked base system:

* x86_64 architecture
* The latest version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Server
* 4-core 2.0 GHz CPU at a minimum

ifeval::["{context}" == "satellite"]
* A minimum of 20 GB memory is required for Satellite Server to function. In addition, a minimum of 4 GB of swap space is also recommended. Satellite running with less memory than the minimum value might not operate correctly.
endif::[]

ifeval::["{context}" == "capsule"]
* A minimum of 12 GB memory is required for Capsule Server to function. In addition, a minimum of 4 GB of swap space is also recommended. Capsule running with less memory than the minimum value might not operate correctly.
endif::[]

* A unique host name, which can contain lower-case letters, numbers, dots (.) and hyphens (-)
* A current Red Hat Satellite subscription
* Administrative user (root) access
* A system umask of 0022
* Full forward and reverse DNS resolution using a fully-qualified domain name


Before you install {ProductName}, ensure that your environment meets the requirements for installation.

{ProductName} must be installed on a freshly provisioned system that serves no other function except to run {ProductName}. The freshly provisioned system must not have the following users provided by external identity providers to avoid conflicts with the local users that {ProductName} creates:

* postgres
* mongodb
* apache
* tomcat
* foreman
* foreman-proxy
* qpidd
* qdrouterd
* squid
* puppet

NOTE: The Red Hat Satellite Server and Capsule Server versions must match. For example, a Satellite 6.2 Server cannot run a {ProductVersion} Capsule Server and a Satellite {ProductVersion} Server cannot run a 6.2 Capsule Server. Mismatching Satellite Server and Capsule Server versions results in the Capsule Server failing silently.

ifeval::["{context}" == "capsule"]
For more information on scaling your Capsule Servers, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_satellite/{ProductVersion}/html/installing_capsule_server/capsule_server_scalability[Capsule Server Scalability Considerations].

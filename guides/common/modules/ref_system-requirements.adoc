{ProductName} is fully supported on both physical systems and virtual machines that run on hypervisors that are supported to run {RHEL}.
For more information about certified hypervisors, see https://access.redhat.com/articles/certified-hypervisors[Certified Guest Operating Systems in Red Hat OpenStack Platform, Red Hat Virtualization, Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization and Red Hat Enterprise Linux with KVM].

Follow these system requirements when installing {ProductName}:

* Install {ProductName} on a freshly provisioned system that serves no other function except to run {ProductName}.
Do not use an existing system because the {Project} installer will affect the configuration of several components.
* Ensure you have administrative user (root) access to the system.
* Ensure the system meets the following requirements:
** 4-core 2.0 GHz CPU or higher

ifeval::["{context}" == "{project-context}"]
** {project-minimum-memory} RAM or higher
endif::[]
ifeval::["{context}" == "{smart-proxy-context}"]
** {smart-proxy-minimum-memory} or higher
endif::[]
ifdef::katello,satellite[]
** 4 GB RAM of swap space or higher
endif::[]

** A unique host name, which can contain lower-case letters, numbers, dots (.) and hyphens (-)

* Ensure that the system does not have the following users provided by external identity providers.
These user accounts can cause conflicts with the local users that {ProductName} creates:
** {apache-user}
ifeval::["{context}" == "{project-context}"]
** foreman
endif::[]
** foreman-proxy
** postgres
ifdef::katello,satellite,orcharhino[]
** pulp
endif::[]
** puppet
** redis
ifdef::katello,satellite,orcharhino[]
ifeval::["{context}" == "{project-context}"]
** tomcat
endif::[]
endif::[]

* If you use custom certificates, ensure that the Common Name (CN) of the custom certificate is a fully qualified domain name (FQDN).
{ProjectServer} and {SmartProxyServer} do not support shortnames in the hostnames.

* Ensure that SELinux is enabled, either in enforcing or permissive mode.
Installation with disabled SELinux is not supported.
For more information, see {PlanningDocURL}security-considerations[Security considerations] in _{PlanningDocTitle}_.
endif::[]

* Ensure that the system clock on the system is synchronized across the network.
If the system clock is not synchronized, SSL certificate verification might fail.

For example, you can use the Chrony suite for timekeeping.

ifeval::["{context}" == "{project-context}"]
* If you are installing in an environment with air-gapped {ProjectServer}s, ensure that all your {ProjectServer}s are on the same {Project} version for ISS Export Sync to work.
ISS Network Sync works across all {Project} versions that support it.
For more information, see {ContentManagementDocURL}Synchronizing_Content_Between_Servers_content-management[Synchronizing Content Between {Project} Servers] in _{ContentManagementDocTitle}_.
endif::[]
endif::[]

* Ensure the system uses the `UTF-8` encoding.
If your territory is USA and your language is English, set `en_US.utf-8` as the system-wide locale settings.

[WARNING]
====
The version of {SmartProxy} must match the version of {Project} installed.
For example, the {SmartProxy} version {ProjectVersion} cannot be registered with the {Project} version {ProjectVersionPrevious}.

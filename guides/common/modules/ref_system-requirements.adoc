= System Requirements

The following requirements apply to the networked base operating system:

* x86_64 architecture
ifdef::satellite[]
* The latest version of {RHEL} 8 Server or {RHEL} 7 Server
endif::[]
* 4-core 2.0 GHz CPU at a minimum

ifdef::foreman-el,foreman-deb[]
ifeval::["{context}" == "{project-context}"]
* A minimum of 4 GB RAM is required for {ProjectServer} to function.
{Project} running with less RAM than the minimum value might not operate correctly.
endif::[]
endif::[]

ifdef::katello,satellite[]
ifeval::["{context}" == "{project-context}"]
* A minimum of 20 GB RAM is required for {ProjectServer} to function.
In addition, a minimum of 4 GB RAM of swap space is also recommended.
{Project} running with less RAM than the minimum value might not operate correctly.
endif::[]

ifeval::["{context}" == "{smart-proxy-context}"]
* A minimum of 12 GB RAM is required for {SmartProxyServer} to function.
In addition, a minimum of 4 GB RAM of swap space is also recommended.
{SmartProxy} running with less RAM than the minimum value might not operate correctly.
endif::[]
endif::[]

ifdef::katello,satellite[]
* A unique host name, which can contain lower-case letters, numbers, dots (.) and hyphens (-)
endif::[]

ifdef::satellite[]
* A current {ProjectName} subscription
endif::[]
* Administrative user (root) access
* A system umask of 0022
* Full forward and reverse DNS resolution using a fully-qualified domain name

{ProjectServer} and {SmartProxyServer} do not support shortnames in the hostnames.
When using custom certificates, the Common Name (CN) of the custom certificate must be a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) instead of a shortname.
This does not apply to the clients of a {Project}.

Before you install {ProductName}, ensure that your environment meets the requirements for installation.

{ProductName} must be installed on a freshly provisioned system that serves no other function except to run {ProductName}.
The freshly provisioned system must not have the following users provided by external identity providers to avoid conflicts with the local users that {ProductName} creates:

* apache
* foreman
* foreman-proxy
* postgres
ifdef::katello,satellite[]
* pulp
endif::[]
* puppet
* puppetserver
ifdef::katello,satellite[]
* qdrouterd
endif::[]
ifdef::katello,satellite[]
ifeval::["{context}" == "{project-context}"]
* qpidd
endif::[]
endif::[]
ifdef::katello,satellite[]
ifeval::["{context}" == "{project-context}"]
* tomcat
endif::[]
endif::[]

.Certified hypervisors
{ProductName} is fully supported on both physical systems and virtual machines that run on hypervisors that are supported to run {RHEL}.
For more information about certified hypervisors, see https://access.redhat.com/certified-hypervisors[Which hypervisors are certified to run {RHEL}?].

endif::[]

ifdef::foreman-el,katello,satellite[]
.SELinux Mode
SELinux must be enabled, either in enforcing or permissive mode.
Installation with disabled SELinux is not supported.

.FIPS Mode
You can install {ProductName} on a {RHEL} system that is operating in FIPS mode.
ifndef::satellite[]
{RHEL} clones are not being actively tested in FIPS mode. If you require FIPS, consider using {RHEL}.

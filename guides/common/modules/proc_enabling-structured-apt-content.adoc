= Enabling structured APT content

You can enable structured APT content on your {Project} to use the same Deb repository structure as the remote repositories they are synchronized from.

.Procedure
. Backup your {ProjectServer}.

For more information, see {AdministeringDocURL}backing-up-{project-context}-server-and-{smart-proxy-context}_admin[Backing Up {ProjectServer} and {SmartProxyServer}] in _{AdministeringDocTitle}_.
. Ensure that there are no running tasks:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} health check --label foreman-tasks-not-running
----
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Administer* > *Settings*.
. On the *Content* tab, set the *Enable structured APT for deb content* setting to `Yes`.
. On your {ProjectServer}, start {Project} maintenance mode:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} maintenance-mode start
----
. Migrate your Deb content:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# foreman-rake katello:migrate_structure_content_for_deb
----
+
On {Project} with 40 Deb repositories published to many content view versions and promoted to multiple lifecycle environments each, this step took 15 minutes.
The amount of time depends on the number of packages, repositories, content view versions, and other tasks running on your {ProjectServer}.
. Stop {Project} maintenance mode:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} maintenance-mode stop
----
. Perform a complete sync of your {SmartProxyServers} that provide Deb content to hosts.

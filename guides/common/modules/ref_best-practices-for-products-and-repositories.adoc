= Best practices for products and repositories

* Use one content type per product and content view, for example, {client-content-type} content only.

* Use file repositories for installation media.
File repositories require a `PULP_MANIFEST` file that you can create using `pulp-manifest /path/to/files`.
Use local repositories with `\file:///path/to/files` as *Upstream URL* in {Project}, for example, for installation media.
Alternatively, place the installation media file repositories on a web server that is accessible to the hosts during provisioning.

* Make file repositories available over HTTP.
If you set *Protected* to true, you can only download content using a global debugging certificate.
* Automate the creation of multiple products and repositories by using a Hammer script or an {ansible-docs-url}[Ansible Playbook].

* For Red Hat content, import your Red Hat manifest into {Project}.
For more information, see xref:Managing_Red_Hat_Subscriptions_{context}[].

ifdef::katello,suse_linux_enterprise_server[]
* For SUSE content, use the SCC Manager plugin.
For more information, see xref:Managing_SUSE_Content_{context}[].

* Avoid uploading content to repositories with an *Upstream URL*.
Instead, create a repository to synchronize content and upload content to without setting an *Upstream URL*.
+
If you upload content to a repository that already synchronizes another repository, the content might be overwritten, depending on the mirroring policy and content type.

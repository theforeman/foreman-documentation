= Examining the Exports of Content View Versions

When importing content to several {ProjectServer}s, the `--destination-server` option is especially useful for keeping track of which content was exported and to where.

You can use this flag to let the exporting {ProjectServer} keep track of content in specific servers.
The `--destination-server` option functions to indicate the destination server that your content is imported to.
The following example uses `--destination-server=mirror1` to export content to `mirror1`.
The archive is created on the exporting {ProjectServer}.
However, a record of each export is also maintained.
This can be very useful when incrementally exporting.

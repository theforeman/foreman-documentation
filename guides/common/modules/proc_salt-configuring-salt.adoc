= Configuring Salt

After you have installed the Salt plugin, you need to connect it to a Salt Master.
This is required when adding Salt support to an existing {Project} installation, when adding an existing Salt Master to {Project}, or when setting up Salt on {SmartProxy}.

ifdef::orcharhino[]
[NOTE]
====
If you select Salt during the xref:sources/installation_and_maintenance/installing_orcharhino_server.adoc#Main_Installation_Steps[main orcharhino installation steps], the installer automatically performs those steps on your {Project}.
Use the following sections as a reference for installing Salt manually on your {Project} or {SmartProxy}.
====
endif::[]

Perform all actions on your Salt Master unless noted otherwise.
This is either your {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer} with Salt enabled.

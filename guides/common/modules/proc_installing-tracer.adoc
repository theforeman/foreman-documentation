= Installing Tracer

Use this procedure to install Tracer on {ProjectName} and access Traces.
Tracer displays a list of services and applications that are outdated and need to be restarted.
Traces is the output generated by Tracer in the {ProjectWebUI}.

.Prerequisites
* The host must be registered to {ProjectName}.
* The {Team} {project-client-name} repository must be enabled and synchronized on {ProjectServer}, and enabled on the host.

.Procedure
. On the content host, install the `katello-host-tools-tracer` RPM package:
+
----
# yum install katello-host-tools-tracer
----
. Enter the following command:
+
----
# katello-tracer-upload
----
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Hosts > All hosts*, then click the required host name.
. Click the *Traces* tab to view Traces.
If it is not installed, an *Enable Traces* button initiates a remote execution job that installs the package.

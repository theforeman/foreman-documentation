= Overview of hosts in {Project}

A host is any Linux client that {ProjectName} manages.
Hosts can be physical or virtual.

You can deploy virtual hosts on any platform supported by {ProjectName},

With {Project}, you can manage hosts at scale, including monitoring, provisioning, remote execution, configuration management, software management, and subscription management.

Host groups::
A host group acts as a template for common host settings.

With host groups, you can define many settings for hosts, such as lifecycle environment, content view, or Ansible roles that are available to the hosts.

ifdef::foreman-el,foreman-deb[]
With host groups, you can define many settings for hosts, such as host parameters or operating system settings that are available to the hosts.
endif::[]
Instead of defining the settings individually for each host, you can use host groups to define common settings once and apply them to multiple hosts.
+
You can create nested host groups.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
When you change the settings of an existing host group, the new settings do not propagate to the hosts assigned to the host group.
Only Puppet class settings get updated on hosts after you change them in the host group.
====

Host collections::
A host collection is a group of content hosts.
+
With host collections, you can perform the same action on multiple hosts at once.
These actions include installing, removing, and updating packages and errata, and assigning content view environments.
+
For example, you can use host collections to group hosts by function, department, or business unit.

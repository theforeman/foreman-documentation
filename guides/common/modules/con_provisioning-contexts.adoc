= Provisioning Contexts

A provisioning context is the combination of an organization and location that you specify for {Project} components.
The organization and location that a component belongs to sets the ownership and access for that component.

Organizations divide {ProjectName} components into logical groups based on ownership, purpose, content, security level, and other divisions.
You can create and manage multiple organizations through {ProjectName} and assign components to each individual organization.
This ensures {ProjectServer} provisions hosts within a certain organization and only uses components that are assigned to that organization.

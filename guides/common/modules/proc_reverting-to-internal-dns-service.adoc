= Reverting to Internal DNS Service

You can revert to using {ProjectServer} and {SmartProxyServer} as your DNS providers.
You can use a backup of the answer file that was created before configuring external DNS, or you can create a backup of the answer file.
For more information about answer files, see {InstallingServerDocURL}configuring-server_{project-context}[Configuring {ProjectServer}].


.Procedure
On the {Project} or {SmartProxyServer} that you want to configure to manage DNS service for the domain, complete the following steps:

.Configuring {Project} or {SmartProxy} as a DNS Server
* If you have created a backup of the answer file before configuring external DNS, restore the answer file and then enter the `{foreman-installer}` command:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,attributes"]
-----
# {foreman-installer}
-----
+
* If you do not have a suitable backup of the answer file, create a backup of the answer file now.
To configure {Project} or {SmartProxy} as DNS server without using an answer file, enter the following `{foreman-installer}` command on {Project} or {SmartProxy}:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-installer} \
--foreman-proxy-dns=true \
--foreman-proxy-dns-managed=true \
--foreman-proxy-dns-provider=nsupdate \
--foreman-proxy-dns-server="127.0.0.1"  \
--foreman-proxy-dns-tsig-principal="foremanproxy/_{foreman-example-com}@EXAMPLE.COM_" \
--foreman-proxy-dns-tsig-keytab=/etc/foreman-proxy/dns.keytab
----
+
For more information,see {InstallingSmartProxyDocURL}configuring-dns-dhcp-and-tftp_{smart-proxy-context}[Configuring DNS, DHCP, and TFTP on {SmartProxyServer}].

After you run the `{foreman-installer}` command to make any changes to your {SmartProxy} configuration, you must update the configuration of each affected {SmartProxy} in the {ProjectWebUI}.


.Updating the Configuration in the {ProjectWebUI}

. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Infrastructure* > *{SmartProxies}*.
. For each {SmartProxy} that you want to update, from the *Actions* list, select *Refresh*.

. Configure the domain:

.. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Infrastructure* > *Domains* and click the domain name that you want to configure.
.. In the *Domain* tab, set *DNS {SmartProxy}* to the {SmartProxy} where the subnet is connected.

. Configure the subnet:

.. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Infrastructure* > *Subnets* and select the subnet name.
.. In the *Subnet* tab, set *IPAM* to *DHCP* or *Internal DB*.
.. In the *Domains* tab, select the domain that you want to manage using {Project} or {SmartProxy}.
.. In the *{SmartProxies}* tab, set *Reverse DNS {SmartProxy}* to the {SmartProxy} where the subnet is connected.
.. Click *Submit* to save the changes.

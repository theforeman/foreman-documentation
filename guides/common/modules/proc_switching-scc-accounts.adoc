= Switching SCC Accounts

You can switch your SCC account by changing the SCC credentials saved on {Project}.

[WARNING]
====
The SCC Manager plug-in does not support multiple SCC accounts.

If you want to switch your SCC account and retain the synchronized content, do not immediately delete your old SCC account, even if it is expired.
If you delete your old SCC account, you cannot reuse existing repositories, products, Content Views, and composite Content Views.
====

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Content > SUSE Subscriptions*.
. Select your SCC account.
. Enter a new *Login* and *Password*.
. Click *Submit* to change your SCC account.

Your new SCC account reuses existing products and repositories from SUSE.
Content that is no longer available for your new SCC account cannot be synchronized anymore.

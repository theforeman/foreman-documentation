= Switching SCC accounts

[role="_abstract"]
You can switch your SCC account by changing the SCC credentials saved on {Project}.

Your new SCC account reuses existing products and repositories from SUSE.
Content that is no longer available for your new SCC account cannot be synchronized anymore.

[WARNING]
====
The SCC Manager plugin does not support multiple SCC accounts within one organization, except for when switching SCC accounts.

If you want to switch your SCC account and retain the synchronized content, do not immediately delete your old SCC account, even if it is expired.
If you delete your old SCC account, you cannot reuse existing repositories, products, content views, and composite content views.

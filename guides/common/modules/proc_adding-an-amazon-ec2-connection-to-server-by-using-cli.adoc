[id="adding-an-amazon-ec2-connection-to-server-by-using-cli"]
= Adding an Amazon EC2 connection to the {ProjectServer} by using Hammer CLI

[role="_abstract"]
Use this procedure to add the Amazon EC2 connection in {ProjectServer}'s compute resources.

.Prerequisites
* An AWS EC2 user performing this procedure needs the `AmazonEC2FullAccess` permissions.
You can attach these permissions from AWS.
* Amazon Web Services uses time settings as part of the authentication process. Provide the correct time to Amazon Web Services to prevent authentication failures:
** Ensure that {ProjectServer}'s time is correctly synchronized.
** Ensure that an NTP service, such as `ntpd` or `chronyd`, is running properly on {ProjectServer}.

.Procedure
* Create the connection with the `hammer compute-resource create` command.
Use `--user` and `--password` options to add the access key and secret key respectively.

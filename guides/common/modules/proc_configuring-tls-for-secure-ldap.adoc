= Configuring TLS for secure LDAP

If {Project} uses TLS to establish a secure LDAP connection (LDAPS), you must obtain the CA certificates  of your LDAP server and add them to the trusted CA list on the base operating system of your {ProjectServer}.

If your LDAP server uses a certificate chain with intermediate certificate authorities,  you must obtain all root and intermediate certificates and add them to the trusted CA list.

.Procedure
. Obtain the CA certificate from the LDAP Server:
.. If you use Active Directory Certificate Services, export the Enterprise PKI CA Certificate using the Base-64 encoded X.509 format.

See https://access.redhat.com/solutions/1498773[How to configure Active Directory authentication with `TLS` on {Project}] for information on creating and exporting a CA certificate from an Active Directory server.
endif::[]
.. Download the LDAP server certificate to a temporary location on the {ProjectServer}, such as `/tmp/_example.crt_`.
You will remove the certificate when finished.
+
The filename extensions `.cer` and `.crt` are only conventions and can refer to DER binary or PEM ASCII format certificates.
. Add the LDAP certificate to your CA trust list:
.. Install the LDAP certificate in the `/etc/pki/tls/certs/` directory with the correct permissions:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# install /tmp/_example.crt_ /etc/pki/tls/certs/
----
+
LDAP certificates must be individual files.
.. Create a symbolic link to the LDAP certificate:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# ln -s _example.crt_ /etc/pki/tls/certs/$(openssl \
x509 -noout -hash -in \
/etc/pki/tls/certs/_example.crt_).0
----
.. Restart the `httpd` service:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# systemctl restart httpd
----
. Delete the downloaded LDAP certificate from the temporary location on your {ProjectServer}.

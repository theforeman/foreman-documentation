[id="Configuring_TLS_for_Secure_LDAP_{context}"]
= Configuring TLS for secure LDAP

If {Project} uses TLS to establish a secure LDAP connection (LDAPS), you must obtain the CA certificates  of your LDAP server and add them to the trusted CA list on the base operating system of your {ProjectServer}.

If your LDAP server uses a certificate chain with intermediate certificate authorities,  you must obtain all root and intermediate certificates and add them to the trusted CA list.

.Procedure
. Obtain the CA certificate from the LDAP Server:
.. If you use Active Directory Certificate Services, export the Enterprise PKI CA Certificate using the Base64 encoded X.509 format.

See https://access.redhat.com/solutions/1498773[How to configure Active Directory authentication with `TLS` on {Project}] for information on creating and exporting a CA certificate from an Active Directory server.
endif::[]
.. Download the LDAP server certificate to a temporary location on the {ProjectServer}, such as `/tmp/_example.crt_`.
You will remove the certificate when finished.
+
The filename extensions `.cer` and `.crt` are only conventions and can refer to DER binary or PEM ASCII format certificates.
. Add the LDAP server certificate to the system truststore:
.. Import the certificate:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# cp /tmp/_example.crt_ /etc/pki/tls/source/anchors
----
.. Update the certificate authority truststore:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# update-ca-trust extract
----
. Delete the downloaded LDAP certificate from the temporary location on your {ProjectServer}.

= Assigning resource quotas to users

You can assign resource quotas to users or user groups.
A user can select one of their assigned resource quotas during host provisioning.
If `Resource Quota optional assignment` is set to *No*, a user does not have to assign a resource quota.
You can use the `resource_quota` filter in the {ProjectWebUI} to view users or user groups with assigned resource quotas.

If you want to introduce resource quotas to your organization, set `Global Resource Quota no action` to *Yes* to allow users to provision hosts even if they exceed their resource quotas.

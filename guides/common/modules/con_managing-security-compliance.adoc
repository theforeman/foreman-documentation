= Managing Security Compliance

Security compliance management is the ongoing process of defining security policies, auditing for compliance with those policies and resolving instances of non-compliance.
Any non-compliance is managed according to the organization's configuration management policies.
Security policies range in scope from host-specific to industry-wide, therefore, flexibility in their definition is required.

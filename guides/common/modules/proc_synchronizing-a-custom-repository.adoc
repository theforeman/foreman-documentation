= Synchronizing a Custom Repository

When using {ISS} Network Sync, Red Hat repositories are configured automatically, but custom repositories are not.
Use this procedure to synchronize content from a custom repository on a connected {ProjectServer} to a disconnected {ProjectServer} through {ISS} (ISS) Network Sync.

Follow the procedure for the connected {ProjectServer} before completing the procedure for the disconnected {ProjectServer}.

.Connected {ProjectServer}
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Content* > *Products*.
. Click on the custom product.
. Click on the custom repository.
. Copy the *Published At:* URL.
. Continue with the procedure on disconnected {ProjectServer}.

.Disconnected {ProjectServer}

+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# curl http://{foreman-example-com}/pub/katello-server-ca.crt
----
. Create an SSL Content Credential with the contents of `katello-server-ca.crt`.
For more information on creating an SSL Content Credential, see xref:Importing_Custom_SSL_Certificates_{context}[].
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Content* > *Products*.

* *Upstream URL*: Paste the link that you copied earlier.
* *SSL CA Cert*: Select the SSL certificate that was transferred from your connected {ProjectServer}.

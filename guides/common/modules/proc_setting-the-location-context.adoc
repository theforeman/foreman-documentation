= Setting the Location Context

A location context defines the location to use for a host and its associated resources.

.Procedure

The location menu is the second menu item in the menu bar, on the upper left of the {ProjectWebUI}.
If you have not selected a current location, the menu displays *Any Location*.
Click *Any location* and select the location to use.

.CLI procedure

While using the CLI, include either `--location "_My_Location_"` or `--location-id "_My_Location_ID_"` as an option.
For example:

[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# hammer host list --location "_My_Location_"
----

This command lists hosts associated with the _My_Location_ location.

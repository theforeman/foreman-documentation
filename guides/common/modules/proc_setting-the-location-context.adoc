= Setting the Location Context

A location context defines the location to use for a host and its associated resources.

.Procedure

The location menu is the second menu item in the menu bar, on the upper left of the {ProjectWebUI}.
If you have not selected a current location, the menu displays *Any Location*.
Click *Any location* and select the location to use.

.CLI procedure

While using the CLI, include either `--location "_your_location_name_"` or `--location-id "_your_location_id_"` as an option.
For example:

[subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer subscription list --location "Default_Location"
----

This command outputs subscriptions allocated for the _Default_Location_.

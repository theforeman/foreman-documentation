= Configuring an alternate CNAME for {Project}

You can configure an alternate CNAME for {Project}.
This might be useful if you want to deploy the {ProjectWebUI} on a different domain name than the one that is used by hosts to connect to {Project}.
You must plan the alternate CNAME configuration in advance before installing {SmartProxyServers} and registering hosts to {Project} to avoid redeploying new certificates to hosts.

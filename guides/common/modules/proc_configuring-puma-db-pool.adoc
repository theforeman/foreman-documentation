= Configuring Puma DB Pool

The effective value of `$db_pool` is automatically set to equal `$foreman::foreman_service_puma_threads_max`.
It is the maximum of `$foreman::db_pool` and `$foreman::foreman_service_puma_threads_max` but both have default value 5, so any increase to the max threads above 5 automatically increases the database connection pool by the same amount

Tuning number of workers is the more important aspect here and in some case we have seen up to 52% performance increase.
Although installer uses 5 min/max threads by default, we recommend 16 threads in with all the tuning profiles in the table above.
That is because we have seen up to 23% performance increase with 16 threads (14% for 8 compared and 10% for 32 compared) when compared to setup with 4 threads.

To get these numbers we used concurrent registrations test case which is a very specific use-case.
It can be different on your {Project} which might have more balanced use-case (not only registrations).
Keeping default 5 min/max threads is a good choise as well.

These are our some measurements that lead us to these recommendations:

Use 4 - 6 workers on a default setup (4 CPUs) - we have seen about 25% higher performance with 5 workers when compared to 2 workers, but 8% lower performance with 8 workers when compared to 2 workers - see table below:

Use 8 - 12 workers on a medium setup (8 CPUs) - see table below:

Use 16 - 24 workers on a 32 CPUs setup (this was tested on a 90 GiB RAM machine and memory turned out to be a factor here as system started swapping - proper _extra-large_ should have 128 GiB), higher number of workers was problematic for higher registration concurrency levels we tested, so we cannot recommend it.

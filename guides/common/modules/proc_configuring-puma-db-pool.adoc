= Configuring Puma DB Pool

The effective value of `$db_pool` is automatically set to equal `$foreman::foreman_service_puma_threads_max`.
It is the maximum of `$foreman::db_pool` and `$foreman::foreman_service_puma_threads_max` but both have default value 5, so any increase to the max threads above 5 automatically increases the database connection pool by the same amount.

If you encounter `ActiveRecord::ConnectionTimeoutError: could not obtain a connection from the pool within 5.000 seconds (waited 5.006 seconds); all pooled connections were in use` error in `/var/log/foreman/production.log`, you might want to increase this value.

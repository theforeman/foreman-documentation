= Monitoring Jobs

You can monitor the progress of a job while it is running.
This can help in any troubleshooting that may be required.

Ansible jobs run on batches of 100 hosts, so you cannot cancel a job running on a specific host.
A job completes only after the Ansible playbook runs on all hosts in the batch.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Monitor > Jobs*.
This page is automatically displayed if you triggered the job with the `Execute now` setting.
To monitor scheduled jobs, navigate to *Monitor* > *Jobs* and select the job run you wish to inspect.
. On the Job page, click the *Hosts* tab.
This displays the list of hosts on which the job is running.
. In the *Host* column, click the name of the host that you want to inspect.
This displays the *Detail of Commands* page where you can monitor the job execution in real time.
. Click *Back to Job* at any time to return to the *Job Details* page.

= Monitoring Jobs

You can monitor the progress of the job while it is running. This can help in any troubleshooting that may be required.

Ansible jobs run on batches of 100 hosts, so you cannot cancel a job running on a specific host. A job completes only after the Ansible playbook runs on all hosts in the batch.

.Procedure

. Navigate to the Job page. This page is automatically displayed if you triggered the job with the `Execute now` setting. To monitor scheduled jobs, navigate to *Monitor* > *Jobs* and select the job run you wish to inspect.
. On the Job page, click the *Hosts* tab. This displays the list of hosts on which the job is running.
. In the *Host* column, click the name of the host that you want to inspect. This displays the *Detail of Commands* page where you can monitor the job execution in real time.
. Click *Back to Job* at any time to return to the *Job Details* page.

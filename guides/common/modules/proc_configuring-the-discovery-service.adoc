= Configuring the Discovery Service

{ProjectName} can detect hosts on a network that are not in your {Project} inventory.
These hosts boot the discovery image that performs hardware detection and relays this information back to {ProjectServer}.
This method creates a list of ready-to-provision hosts in {ProjectServer} without needing to enter the MAC address of each host.

When you boot a blank bare-metal host, the boot menu has two options: `local` and `discovery`.
If you select `discovery` to boot the Discovery image, after a few minutes, the Discovery image completes booting and a status screen is displayed.

The Discovery service is enabled by default on {ProjectServer}.
However, the default setting of the global templates is to boot from the local hard drive.
To change the default setting, in the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Administer* *>* *Settings*, and click the *Provisioning* tab.
Locate the *Default PXE global template entry* row, and in the *Value* column, enter *discovery*.

Ensure that the DHCP range of all subnets that you plan to use for discovery do not intersect with the DHCP lease pool configured for the managed DHCP service.
The DHCP range is set in the {ProjectWebUI}, while the lease pool range is set using the `{foreman-installer}` command.
For example, in a 10.1.0.0/16 network range 10.1.0.0 to 10.1.127.255 could be allocated for leases and 10.1.128.0 to 10.1.255.254 could be allocated for reservations.

hosts or virtual machines can be created with incorrect network configurations. On Dell servers, the new naming scheme can be disabled via `biosdevname=1` kernel command line option, for other hardware or virtual machines, the new naming scheme can be completely turned off via `net.ifnames=1`.

.Procedure
. Install Discovery on {ProjectServer}:
ifdef::satellite,orcharhino[]
+
The `{fdi-package-name}` package installs the Discovery ISO to the `/usr/share/foreman-discovery-image/` directory.
You can build a PXE boot image from this ISO using the `livecd-iso-to-pxeboot` tool.
The tool saves this PXE boot image in the `/var/lib/tftpboot/boot` directory.
For more information, see xref:Building_a_Discovery_Image_{context}[].

= Calling the API in curl

You can use `curl` with the {Project} API to perform various tasks.

{ProjectName} requires the use of HTTPS, and by default a certificate for host identification.
If you have not added the {ProjectServer} certificate as described in xref:ssl-authentication-overview[], then you can use the `--insecure` option to bypass certificate checks.

For user authentication, you can use the `--user` option to provide {Project} user credentials in the form `--user _username:password_` or, if you do not include the password, the command prompts you to enter it.
To reduce security risks, do not include the password as part of the command, because it then becomes part of your shell history.
Examples in this section include the password only for the sake of simplicity.

Be aware that if you use the `--silent` option, `curl` does not display a progress meter or any error messages.

Examples in this chapter use the Python `json.tool` module to format the output.

= Reverting {Project} to Download Content from Red Hat CDN

If your environment changes from disconnected to connected, you can reconfigure a disconnected {Project} to download content directly from the Red Hat CDN.

.Procedure

. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Content* > *Subscriptions*.

. Click *Manage Manifest*.

. Edit the *Red Hat CDN URL* field to point to the Red Hat CDN URL:
+
`https://cdn.redhat.com`

. Click *Save*.

{ProjectServer} is now configured to download content from the CDN the next time that it synchronizes repositories.

= Configuring Networking

Each provisioning type requires some network configuration.
Use this chapter to configure network services in your integrated {SmartProxy} on {ProjectServer}.

New hosts must have access to your {SmartProxyServer}.
{SmartProxyServer} can be either your integrated {SmartProxy} on {ProjectServer} or an external {SmartProxyServer}.
You might want to provision hosts from an external {SmartProxyServer} when the hosts are on isolated networks and cannot connect to {ProjectServer} directly, or when the content is synchronized with {SmartProxyServer}.
Provisioning using the external {SmartProxyServer} can save on network bandwidth.

Configuring {SmartProxyServer} has two basic requirements:

. Configuring network services.
This includes:
** Content delivery services
** Network services (DHCP, DNS, and TFTP)
** Puppet configuration
. Defining network resource data in {ProjectServer} to help configure network interfaces on new hosts.

The following instructions have similar applications to configuring standalone {SmartProxies} managing a specific network.
To configure {Project} to use external DHCP, DNS, and TFTP services, see {InstallingServerDocURL}configuring-external-services[Configuring External Services] in _{InstallingServerDocTitle}_.

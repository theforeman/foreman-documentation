= Adding the {oVirt} Connection to {ProjectServer}

Use this procedure to add {oVirt} as a compute resource in {Project}.
To use the CLI instead of the web UI, see the xref:cli-adding-rhv-connection_{context}[].

.Procedure

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Infrastructure* > *Compute Resources* and click *Create Compute Resource*.
. In the *Name* field, enter a name for the new compute resource.
. From the *Provider* list, select *{oVirtShort}*.
. In the *Description* field, enter a description for the compute resource.
. In the *URL* field, enter the connection URL for the {oVirtEngine}'s API in the following form: `\https://{ovirt-example-com}/ovirt-engine/api/v4`.
. In the *User* field, enter the name of a user with permissions to access {oVirtEngine}'s resources.
. In the *Password* field, enter the password of the user.
. Click *Load Datacenters* to populate the *Datacenter* list with data centers from your {oVirt} environment.
. From the *Datacenter* list, select a data center.
. From the *Quota ID* list, select a quota to limit resources available to {Project}.
. In the *X509 Certification Authorities* field, enter the certificate authority for SSL/TLS access.
Alternatively, if you leave the field blank, a self-signed certificate is generated on the first API request by the server.
. Click the *Locations* tab and select the location you want to use.
. Click the *Organizations* tab and select the organization you want to use.
. Click *Submit* to save the compute resource.

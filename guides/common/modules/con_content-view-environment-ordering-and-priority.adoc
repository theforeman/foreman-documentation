The order of content view environments assigned to a host or activation key determines content priority.
During host registration, an activation key assigns content view environments in the order in which they are stored.

.General rules for content view environment priority
A host pulls content from the first assigned content view environment that contains the repository.
If `Library` is first in the list, it overrides other content view environments because it contains all repositories.

.Importance of content view environment order
Content view environment order is critical when repository conflicts occur.
A repository conflict occurs when multiple content view environments contain a repository with the same label.
For example:
A host assigned to the content view environments `Library/cv1, dev/cv1` uses the following configuration:

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
$ hammer host update \
--content-view-environments "Library/cv1,dev/cv1" \
--name "{server-example-com}" \
--organization-id _My_Organization_ID_
----

Both content view environments include the `{example-repo-id}` repository.
Log in as a `root` user, then run `subscription-manager repos` to inspect the available repositories on the host. 
The output reflects the `Library/cv1` content view environment:

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# subscription-manager repos
----

This results in the following output:

[source, none, options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
+----------------------------------------------------------+
    Available Repositories in /etc/yum.repos.d/redhat.repo
+----------------------------------------------------------+
Repo ID:   {example-repo-id}
Repo Name: {example-repo-name}
ifdef::satellite[]
Repo URL:  https://{foreman-example-com}/pulp/content/_My_Organization_/Library/cv1/content/dist/layered/rhel9/x86_64/_My_Product_/_My_Repository_ID_/os
endif::[]
ifndef::satellite[]
Repo URL:  https://{foreman-example-com}/pulp/content/_My_Organization_/Library/cv1/content/dist/layered/{project-context}-client/x86_64/_My_Product_/_My_Repository_ID_/os
endif::[]
Enabled:   0

[NOTE]
====
The `Repo URL` reflects the `Library/cv1` content view environment, meaning the system uses content from `Library/cv1` and ignores `dev/cv1`.
====

.Reordering content view environments
To change priority, reorder the content view environments.
To prioritize `dev/cv1` over `Library/cv1`, update the host settings:

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
$ hammer host update \
--content-view-environments "dev/cv1,Library/cv1" \
--name "{server-example-com}" \
--organization-id _My_Organization_ID_
----

After reordering, inspecting the repositories again shows the `dev/cv1` content view environment:

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# subscription-manager repos
----

This results in the following output:

[source, none, options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
+----------------------------------------------------------+
    Available Repositories in /etc/yum.repos.d/redhat.repo
+----------------------------------------------------------+
Repo ID:   {example-repo-id}
Repo Name: {example-repo-name}
ifdef::satellite[]
Repo URL:  https://{foreman-example-com}/pulp/content/_My_Organization_/dev/cv1/content/dist/layered/rhel9/x86_64/_My_Product_/_My_Repository_ID_/os
endif::[]
ifndef::satellite[]
Repo URL:  https://{foreman-example-com}/pulp/content/_My_Organization_/dev/cv1/content/dist/layered/{project-context}-client/x86_64/_My_Product_/_My_Repository_ID_/os
endif::[]
Enabled:   0
----

The `Repo URL` now reflects the `dev/cv1` content view environment, meaning the system uses content from `dev/cv1` and ignores `Library/cv1`.

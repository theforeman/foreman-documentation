= Performing Discovery in PXE-less mode
[[Implementing_PXE_less_Discovery_{context}]]

Discovery in PXE-less mode uses the Discovery ISO and requires you to attend to the process.

.Prerequisites
ifdef::satellite,orcharhino[]
* You have installed the Foreman Discovery image.
For more information, see xref:Installing_the_Discovery_Service_{context}[].
endif::[]
ifndef::satellite,orcharhino[]
* You have installed the Foreman Discovery image or built a custom Discovery image ISO.
For more information, see one of the following resources:
** xref:Installing_the_Discovery_Service_{context}[]
** xref:Building_a_custom_Discovery_Image_{context}[]
endif::[]

.Procedure
. Copy the Discovery ISO to either a CD, DVD, or a USB stick.
For example, to copy to a USB stick at `/dev/sdb`:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# dd bs=4M \
if=/usr/share/foreman-discovery-image/foreman-discovery-image-_version_.iso \
of=/dev/sdb
----
. Insert the Discovery boot media into a bare-metal host, start the host, and boot from the media.
The Discovery Image displays an option for either *Manual network setup* or *Discovery with DHCP*:
+

* If you select *Manual network setup*, the Discovery image requests a set of network options.
This includes the primary network interface that connects to {ProjectServer}.
This Discovery image also asks for network interface configuration options, such as an *IPv4 Address*, *IPv4 Gateway*, and an *IPv4 DNS* server.
+
After entering these details, select *Next*.
* If you select *Discovery with DHCP*, the Discovery image requests only the primary network interface that connects to {ProjectServer}.
It attempts to automatically configure the network interface using a DHCP server, such as one that a {SmartProxyServer} provides.
. After the primary interface configuration, the Discovery image requests the *Server URL*, which is the URL of {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer} offering the Discovery service.
For example, to use the integrated {SmartProxy} on {ProjectServer}, use the following URL:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
https://{foreman-example-com}:{smartproxy_port}
----
. Set the *Connection type* to `Proxy`, then select *Next*.
. Optional: The Discovery image also provides a set of fields to input *Custom facts* for the Facter tool to relay back to {ProjectServer}.
These are entered in a *name*-*value* format.
Provide any custom facts you require and select *Confirm* to continue.

.Verification
* {ProjectWebUI} displays a notification about a new discovered host.

.Next steps
* In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Hosts* > *Discovered Hosts* and view the newly discovered host.
For more information about provisioning discovered hosts, see xref:Creating_Hosts_from_Discovered_Hosts_{context}[].

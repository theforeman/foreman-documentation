= Performing Discovery in PXE-less mode
[[Implementing_PXE_less_Discovery_{context}]]

Discovery in PXE-less mode uses the Discovery ISO and requires you to attend to the process.

.Prerequisites
ifdef::satellite,orcharhino[]
* You have installed the Foreman Discovery image.
For more information, see xref:Installing_the_Discovery_Service_{context}[].
endif::[]
ifndef::satellite,orcharhino[]
* You have installed the Foreman Discovery image or built a custom Discovery image ISO.
For more information, see one of the following resources:
** xref:Installing_the_Discovery_Service_{context}[]
** xref:Building_a_custom_Discovery_Image_{context}[]
endif::[]

.Procedure
. Copy the Discovery ISO to a CD, DVD, or a USB flash drive.
For example, to copy to a USB drive at `/dev/sdb`:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# dd bs=4M \
if=/usr/share/foreman-discovery-image/foreman-discovery-image-_version_.iso \
of=/dev/sdb
----
. Insert the Discovery boot media into a host, start the host, and boot from the media.
. The Discovery image displays options for either *Manual network setup* or *Discovery with DHCP*:

* *Manual network setup*:
include::snip_step-discovery-pxeless-primary-interface.adoc[]
.. On the *Network configuration* screen, enter the *Address*, *Gateway*, and *DNS*.
Hit *Next* to continue.
* *Discovery with DHCP*:
include::snip_step-discovery-pxeless-primary-interface.adoc[]
.. The Discovery image attempts to automatically configure the network interface by using a DHCP server, such as one that a {SmartProxyServer} provides.
. On the *Credentials* screen, enter the following options:
+
** In the *Server URL* field, enter the URL of {ProjectServer} or Discovery {SmartProxyServer}.
If you refer to a {SmartProxyServer}, include the {SmartProxy} port number.
** In the *Connection type* field, select the connection type: `Server` for {ProjectServer} or `Foreman Proxy` for {SmartProxyServer}.

+
Hit *Next* to continue.
. Optional: On the *Custom facts* screen, enter custom facts for the Facter tool to relay back to {ProjectServer}.
Enter a name and value for each custom fact you need.
. Hit *Confirm* to proceed.

.Verification
* {ProjectWebUI} displays a notification about a new discovered host.

.Next steps
* In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Hosts* > *Discovered Hosts* and view the newly discovered host.

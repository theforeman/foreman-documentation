[id="provisioning-from-a-builder-image-on-{smart-proxy-context}"]
= Provisioning from a {LoraxCompose} image on {SmartProxy}

You can upload a {LoraxCompose} image to {Project} and use this image to provision hosts by using network boot.

[NOTE]

This feature is available for {EL} hosts only.

When you provision from a {LoraxCompose} image, Anaconda installer partitions disks, downloads and mounts the image, and copies files over to a host.

.Prerequisites
* An existing TAR image created by using {LoraxCompose} in {the-Cockpit}.
Ensure that your blueprint to build the image includes the xref:packages-required-in-a-builder-image[required packages].
* If you want to use {SmartProxyServer} URL, then the referenced lifecycle environment, such as Library, must be synchronized to that {SmartProxyServer}.
For more information, see {InstallingSmartProxyDocURL}Adding_Lifecycle_Environments_{smart-proxy-context}[Adding lifecycle environments to {SmartProxyServers}] in _{InstallingSmartProxyDocTitle}_.

.Procedure
. On {Project}, create a {customproduct}, add a {customfiletype} repository to this product, and upload the image to the repository.
For more information, see {ContentManagementDocURL}Importing_Individual_ISO_Images_and_Files_content-management[Importing individual ISO images and files] in _{ContentManagementDocTitle}_.
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Configure* > *Host Groups*.
. Select the host group that you want to use.
. Click the *Parameters* tab, and then click *Add Parameter*.
. Create a parameter named `kickstart_liveimg` with type *string* and set the value to the URL or a relative path of the image location, for example:
* URL: `https://_{smartproxy-example-com}_/pulp/content/_My_Organization_Label_/Library/custom/_My_Product_Label_/_My_Repository_Label_/_My_Image_Name_.tar`
* Relative path: `custom/_My_Product_Label_/_My_Repository_Label_/_My_Image_Name_.tar`
. Click *Submit* to save your changes.

= Exporting a Content View Version in a Syncable Format

You can export a version of a Content View to a syncabe format that you can use to create your custom CDN and synchronize the content from the custom CDN over HTTP/HTTPS.

ifdef::satellite[]
You can then serve the generated content via a local webserver on the importing {ProjectServer} or in another {ProjectServer} organization.

You cannot directly import Syncable Format exports. Instead, on the importing {ProjectServer} you must:

* Copy the generated content to an HTTP/HTTPS webserver that is accessible to importing {ProjectServer}
* Update your CDN configuration to *Custom CDN*
* Set the CDN URL to point to the web server
* Optionally set a SSL CA Credential if the web server requires it
* Enable the Repository
* Synchronize the Repository.
endif::[]

ifndef::satellite[]
You can use the generated content to create the same repository in another {ProjectServer} or in another {ProjectServer} organization using content import.
On importing the exported archive, a regular Content View is created or updated on your downstream {ProjectServer}.
For more information, see xref:Importing_a_Content_View_Version_{context}[].
endif::[]

You can export the following content in a syncable format from {ProjectServer}:
* File repositories
* Kickstart repositories
* RPM repositories

You cannot export Ansible and Docker content.

ifndef::satellite[]
You cannot export DEB repositories.
endif::[]

The export contains the following data:

* Directories containing the rpms, *listing* files and metadata of each repository in yum format that could then be used synchronize in the importing {ProjectServer}.

.Prerequisites
* Ensure that you set download policy to *Immediate* for all repositories within the Content View you export.
For more information, see xref:Download_Policies_Overview_{context}[].
* Ensure that you synchronize Products that you export to the required date.
* Ensure that the user exporting the content has the `Content Exporter` role.

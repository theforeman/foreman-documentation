= Configuring Puppet intervals of automatic enforcement

[role="_abstract"]
Tune enforcement frequency and reporting by configuring intervals of automatic enforcement for Puppet.

{Project} considers hosts to be out of sync if the last Puppet report is older than the combined values of `outofsync_interval` and `puppet_interval` set in minutes.

Default values for automatic enforcement are as follows:

* The Puppet agent on your hosts runs every 30 minutes
* The `puppet_interval` value is 35 minutes
* The global `outofsync_interval` value is 30 minutes

.Procedure
. Set the interval when the Puppet agent runs and sends reports to {Project}:
.. Connect to your host using SSH.
.. Add the Puppet agent run interval to `/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/puppet.conf`, for example, `runinterval = 1h`:
. Set the global out-of-sync interval:
.. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Administer* > *Settings*.
.. On the *General* tab, edit *Out of sync interval*.
Set a duration, in minutes, after which hosts are considered to be out of sync.
. Set the Puppet out-of-sync interval:
.. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Administer* > *Settings*.
.. Select the *Config Management* tab.
.. In the *Puppet interval* field, set the value to the duration, in minutes, after which hosts reporting using Puppet are considered to be out of sync.

.Example automatic enforcement values
====
The effective time after which hosts are considered out of sync is the sum of `outofsync_interval` and `puppet_interval`.
For example, setting the global `outofsync_interval` to 30 and the `puppet_interval` to 60 results in a total of 90 minutes after which the host status changes to `out of sync`.

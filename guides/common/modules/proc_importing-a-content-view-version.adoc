= Importing a content view version

You can import an exported content view version to create a version with the same content in an organization on another {ProjectServer}.
For more information about exporting a content view version, see xref:Exporting_a_Content_View_Version_{context}[].

When you import a content view version, it has the same major and minor version numbers and contains the same repositories with the same packages and errata.
endif::[]
Custom repositories, products and content views are automatically created if they do not exist in the importing organization.

.Prerequisites
* The exported files must be in a directory under `/var/lib/pulp/imports`.
ifdef::client-content-dnf[]
* If there are any Red Hat repositories in the exported content, the importing organization's manifest must contain subscriptions for the products contained within the export.
endif::[]
* The user importing the content view version must have the _Content Importer_ Role.

.Procedure
. Copy the exported files to a subdirectory of `/var/lib/pulp/imports` on {ProjectServer} where you want to import.
. Set the ownership of the import directory and its contents to `pulp:pulp`.

. To import the content view version to {ProjectServer}, enter the following command:

[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# hammer content-import version \
--organization=_My_Organization_ \
--path=/var/lib/pulp/imports/2021-02-25T21-15-22-00-00/
----
+
Note that you must enter the full path `/var/lib/pulp/imports/_My_Exported_Version_Dir_`.
Relative paths do not work.
. To verify that you imported the content view version successfully, list content view versions for your organization:

----
# hammer content-view version list \
--organization-id=_My_Organization_ID_

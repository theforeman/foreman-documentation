= Importing a content view version

[role="_abstract"]
You can import an exported content view version to create a version with the same content in an organization on another {ProjectServer}.
For more information about exporting a content view version, see xref:Exporting_a_Content_View_Version_{context}[].

ifdef::debian,ubuntu[]
When you import a content view version, it has the same major and minor version numbers and contains the same repositories with the same packages.
endif::[]
ifndef::debian,ubuntu[]
When you import a content view version, it has the same major and minor version numbers and contains the same repositories with the same packages and errata.
endif::[]
Custom repositories, products and content views are automatically created if they do not exist in the importing organization.

.Prerequisites
* The exported files must be in a directory under `/var/lib/pulp/imports`.
ifdef::client-content-dnf[]
* If there are any Red Hat repositories in the exported content, the importing organization's manifest must contain subscriptions for the products contained within the export.
endif::[]
* The user importing the content view version must have the _Content Importer_ Role.

.Procedure
. Copy the exported files to a subdirectory of `/var/lib/pulp/imports` on {ProjectServer} where you want to import.
. Set the ownership of the import directory and its contents to `pulp:pulp`:
+
[subs="+quotes"]
----
# chown -R pulp:pulp /var/lib/pulp/imports/2021-02-25T21-15-22-00-00/
----
. Verify that the ownership is set correctly:
+
[subs="+quotes"]
----
# ls -lh /var/lib/pulp/imports/2021-02-25T21-15-22-00-00/
----
. Import the content view version to {ProjectServer}:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
$ hammer content-import version \
--organization=_My_Organization_ \
--path=/var/lib/pulp/imports/2021-02-25T21-15-22-00-00/
----
+
You must specify the absolute path as in the example: `/var/lib/pulp/imports/2021-02-25T21-15-22-00-00/`.
Relative paths do not work.
. Verify that you imported the content view version successfully by listing the content view versions for your organization:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
$ hammer content-view version list \
--organization-id=_My_Organization_ID_
----
+
The importing {ProjectServer} extracts the `/var/lib/pulp/imports` directory to `/var/lib/pulp/`.
. Delete the import files after a successful import:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# rm -fr /var/lib/pulp/imports/2021-02-25T21-15-22-00-00/
----

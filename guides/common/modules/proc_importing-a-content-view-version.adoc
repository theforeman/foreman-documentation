= Importing a Content View Version

You can use the archive that the `hammer content-export` command outputs to create a version of a Content View with the same content as the exported Content View version.
For more information about exporting a Content View version, see xref:Exporting_a_Content_View_Version[].

When you import a Content View version, it has the same major and minor version numbers and contains the same repositories with the same packages and errata.
The Custom Repositories, Products and Content Views are automatically created if they do not exist in the importing organization.

.Prerequisites

To import a Content View, ensure that {ProjectServer} where you want to import meets the following conditions:

. The exported archive must be in a directory under `/var/lib/pulp/imports`.
. The directory must have `pulp:pulp` permissions so that Pulp can read and write the `.json` files in that directory.
. If there are any Red Hat repositories in the export archive, the importing organization's manifest must contain subscriptions for the products contained within the export.
. The user importing the content view version must have the 'Content Importer' Role.

.Procedure
. Copy the archived file with the exported Content View version to the `/var/lib/pulp/imports` directory on {ProjectServer} where you want to import.
. Set the user:group permission of the archive files to `pulp:pulp`.

# hammer content-import version --organization=import-20639 \
                                --path=/var/lib/pulp/imports/2021-02-25T21-15-22-00-00/
----

Note that you must enter the full path `/var/lib/pulp/imports/<path>`. Relative paths do not work.
. To verify that you import the Content View version successfully, list Content Views for your organization:

# hammer content-view version list --content-view=view \

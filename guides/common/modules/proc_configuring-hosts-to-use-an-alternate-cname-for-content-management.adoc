= Configuring hosts to use an alternate {Project} CNAME for content management

[role="_abstract"]
If {Project} is configured with an alternate CNAME, you can configure hosts to use the alternate {Project} CNAME for content management.
To do this, you must point hosts to the alternate {Project} CNAME prior to registering the hosts to {Project}.
You can do this using the bootstrap script or manually.

Perform these steps on the hosts you want to configure.

.Procedure
* If you want to configure the host with the bootstrap script, run the bootstrap script with the `--server _My-Alternate-FQDN.example.com_` option to register the host to the alternate {Project} CNAME:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# ./bootstrap.py --server _My-Alternate-FQDN.example.com_
----
* If you want to configure the host manually, edit the `/etc/rhsm/rhsm.conf` file to update `hostname` and `baseurl` settings to point to the alternate host name, for example:
+
[source, none, options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
[server]
# Server hostname:
hostname = _My-Alternate-FQDN.example.com_

_content omitted_

[rhsm]
# Content base URL:
baseurl=https://_My-Alternate-FQDN.example.com_/pulp/content/
----

.Next steps
* Now you can register the host with the `subscription-manager`.

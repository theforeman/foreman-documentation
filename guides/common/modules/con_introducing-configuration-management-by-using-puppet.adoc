= Introducing configuration management by using Puppet

[role="_abstract"]
You can use Puppet to manage and automate configurations of hosts.
Puppet uses a declarative language to describe the _desired state_ of hosts.

Puppet increases your productivity as you can administer multiple hosts simultaneously.
At the same time, it decreases your configuration effort as Puppet makes it easy to verify and possibly correct the state of the hosts.

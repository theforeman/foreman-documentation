= Exporting an Increment of a Content View Version

Exporting complete versions can be a very expensive operation on storage space and resources.
ifdef::orcharhino[]
The size of the exported Content View versions depends on the number of products.
endif::[]
Content View versions that have multiple {RHEL} trees can occupy several gigabytes of the space on {ProjectServer}.

You can use the *Incremental Export* functionality to help reduce demands on your infrastructure.
*Incremental Export* exports only the content that changed from the previously exported version.
Generally, incremental changes are smaller than full exports.

ln the following example, the command targets version 2.0 for export, because the version `1.0` has already been exported.

.Prerequisites
* You did a complete export previously.

.Procedure
* Run content export with the `incremental` argument:

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]

= Delegating Permissions for Remote Execution

You can control which users can run which jobs within your infrastructure, including which hosts they can target. The remote execution feature provides two built-in roles:

* *Remote Execution Manager*: This role allows access to all remote execution features and functionality.

* *Remote Execution User*: This role only allows running jobs; it does not provide permission to modify job templates.

You can clone the Remote Execution User role and customize its filter for increased granularity. If you adjust the filter with the `view_job_templates` permission, the user can only see and trigger jobs based on matching job templates. You can use the `view_hosts` and `view_smart_proxies` permissions to limit which hosts or {SmartProxies} are visible to the role.

The `execute_template_invocation` permission is a special permission that is checked immediately before execution of a job begins. This permission defines which job template you can run on a particular host. This allows for even more granularity when specifying permissions. For more information on working with roles and permissions see link:{BaseURL}administering_red_hat_satellite/chap-red_hat_satellite-administering_red_hat_satellite-users_and_roles#sect-{Project_Link}-Administering_{Project_Link}-Users_and_Roles-Creating_and_Managing_Roles[Creating and Managing Roles] in the _Administering {ProjectName}_.

The following example shows filters for the `execute_template_invocation` permission:

[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
name = Reboot and host.name = staging.example.com
name = Reboot and host.name ~ *.staging.example.com
name = "Restart service" and host_group.name = webservers
----

The first line in this example permits the user to apply the *Reboot* template to one selected host. The second line defines a pool of hosts with names ending with *.staging.example.com*. The third line binds the template with a host group.

[NOTE]
====
Permissions assigned to users can change over time. If a user has already scheduled some jobs to run in the future, and the permissions have changed, this can result in execution failure because the permissions are checked immediately before job execution.

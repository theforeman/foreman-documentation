[id="virt-who-does-not-report-to-{project-context}-server"]
= virt-who does not report to {ProjectServer}

virt-who might not report to {ProjectServer} if {ProjectServer} is configured to use a proxy server in `rhsm.conf` while virt-who is configured not to use a proxy server in `/etc/sysconfig/virt-who`.

The virt-who setting is ignored by the Subscription Manager. As a result, virt-who attempts to connect to {ProjectServer} through a proxy server and fails.

To work around this problem, add the following parameter to the `/etc/rhsm/rhsm.conf` file:

[source,text]
----
no_proxy = server.example.com
----

= Decreasing Performance Impact of the Pull-Based REX Transport

When {ProjectServer} is configured with the pull-based transport mode for remote execution jobs using the Script provider, {SmartProxyServer} sends notifications about new jobs to clients through MQTT.
This notification does not include the actual workload that the client is supposed to execute.
After a client receives a notification about a new remote execution job, it queries {SmartProxyServer} for its actual workload.
During the job, the client periodically sends outputs of the job to {SmartProxyServer}, further increasing the number of requests to {SmartProxyServer}.

These requests to {SmartProxyServer} together with high concurrency allowed by the MQTT protocol can cause exhaustion of available connections on {SmartProxyServer}.
Some requests might fail, making some child tasks of remote execution jobs unresponsive. 
This also depends on actual job workload, as some jobs are causing additional load to {ProjectServer}, making it compete for resources if clients are registered to {ProjectServer}.

To avoid this, configure your {ProjectServer} and {SmartProxyServer} with the following parameters:

* MQTT Time To Live {endash} Time interval in seconds given to the host to pick up the job before considering the job undelivered
* MQTT Resend Interval {endash} Time interval in seconds at which the notification should be re-sent to the host until the job is picked up or cancelled
* MQTT Rate Limit {endash} Number of jobs that are allowed to run at the same time.
You can limit the concurrency of remote execution by tuning the rate limit which means you are going to put more load on {Project}.

.Procedure
* Tune the MQTT parameters on your {ProjectServer}:

{SmartProxyServer} logs are in `/var/log/foreman-proxy/proxy.log`. 
{SmartProxyServer} uses Webrick HTTP server (no httpd or Puma involved), so there is no simple way to increase its capacity.

[NOTE]
====
Depending on the workload, number of hosts, available resources, and applied tuning, you might hit the https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2244811[Bug 2244811], which causes {SmartProxy} to consume too much memory and eventually be killed, making the rest of the job fail. 
At the moment there is no universally applicable workaround.

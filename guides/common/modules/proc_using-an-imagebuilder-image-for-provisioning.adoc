= Using a {LoraxCompose} Image for Provisioning

In {Project}, you can integrate with {Cockpit} to perform actions and monitor your hosts.
Using {Cockpit}, you can access {LoraxCompose} and build images that you can then upload to a HTTP server and use this image to provision hosts.
When you configure {Project} for image provisioning, Anaconda installer partitions disks, downloads and mounts the image and copies files over to a host.
The preferred image type is TAR.

You can use this image for bare metal provisioning and provisioning using a compute resource.
For more information about bare metal provisioning, see xref:Using_PXE_to_Provision_Hosts_{context}[].
For more information about provisioning with different compute resources, see the relevant chapter for the compute resource that you want to use.

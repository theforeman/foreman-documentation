= Using a {LoraxCompose} image for provisioning

In {Project}, you can enable integration with {CockpitL} to perform actions and monitor your hosts.
Using {CockpitL}, you can access {LoraxCompose} and build images that you can then upload to an HTTP server and use this image to provision hosts.
When you configure {Project} for image provisioning, Anaconda installer partitions disks, downloads and mounts the image and copies files over to a host.
The preferred image type is TAR.

Ensure that your blueprint to build the TAR image includes a kernel package.

.Prerequisites
* An existing TAR image created using {LoraxCompose}.

.Procedure
ifdef::katello,satellite,orcharhino[]
. On {Project}, create a custom product, add a custom file repository to this product, and upload the image to the repository.

. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Configure* > *Host Groups*, and select the host group that you want to use.
. Click the *Parameters* tab, and then click *Add Parameter*.
. In the *Name* field, enter `kickstart_liveimg`.
. From the *Type* list, select *string*.
. In the *Value* field, enter the absolute path or a relative path in the following format `custom/_product_/_repository_/_image_name_` that points to the exact location where you store the image.
. Click *Submit* to save your changes.

You can use this image for bare-metal provisioning and provisioning using a compute resource.
For more information about bare-metal provisioning, see xref:Using_PXE_to_Provision_Hosts_{context}[].
For more information about provisioning with different compute resources, see the relevant chapter for the compute resource that you want to use.

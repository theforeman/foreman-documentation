= Using a {LoraxCompose} Image for Provisioning

In {Project}, you can integrate with {Cockpit} to perform actions and monitor your hosts.
Using {Cockpit}, you can access {LoraxCompose} and build images that you can then upload to a HTTP server and use this image to provision hosts.
When you configure {Project} for image provisioning, Anaconda installer partitions disks, downloads and mounts the image and copies files over to a host.
The preferred image type is TAR.

.Prerequisites
. An existing TAR image created via {LoraxCompose}.

.Procedure
ifdef::satellite,orcharhino[]
. On {Project}, create a custom product, add a custom file repository to this product, and upload the image to the repository.
For more information, see {ContentManagementDocURL}importing_individual_iso_images_and_files[Importing Individual ISO Images and Files] in the _Content Management Guide_.
endif::[]
ifdef::foreman-el,katello[]
. If you use the Katello plug-in, on {Project}, create a custom product, add a custom file repository to this product, and upload the image to the repository.
For more information, see {ContentManagementDocURL}importing_individual_iso_images_and_files[Importing Individual ISO Images and Files] in the _Content Management Guide_.

. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Configure* > *Host Groups*, and select the host group that you want to use.
. Click the *Parameters* tab, and then click *Add Parameter*.
. In the *Name* field, enter `kickstart_liveimg`.
. From the *Type* list, select *string*.

. Click *Submit* to save your changes.

You can use this image for bare metal provisioning and provisioning using a compute resource.
For more information about bare metal provisioning, see xref:Using_PXE_to_Provision_Hosts_{context}[].
For more information about provisioning with different compute resources, see the relevant chapter for the compute resource that you want to use.

= Registering a host to the load balancer using API

[role="_abstract"]
After setting the load balancer for host registration, you can register a host to a load-balanced {SmartProxy}.

.Procedure
. Generate the host registration command using the {Project} API:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# curl -X POST https://{foreman-example-com}/api/registration_commands \
--user "_My_User_Name_" \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{ "registration_command": { "activation_keys": ["_My_Activation_Key_1_, _My_Activation_Key_2_"] }}'
----
+
If your hosts do not trust the SSL certificate of {ProjectServer}, you can disable SSL validation by adding the `--insecure` flag to the registration command.
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# curl -X POST https://{foreman-example-com}/api/registration_commands \
--user "_My_User_Name_" \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{ "registration_command": { "activation_keys": ["_My_Activation_Key_1_, _My_Activation_Key_2_"], "insecure": true }}'
----
+
Use an activation key to simplify specifying the environments.
For more information, see {ContentManagementDocURL}Managing_Activation_Keys_content-management[Managing Activation Keys] in _{ContentManagementDocTitle}_.
+
Include `{ "smart_proxy_id": __My_{smart-proxy-context-titlecase}_ID__ }`.
You can use the ID of any {SmartProxyServer} that you configured for host registration load balancing.
{Project} will apply the load balancer to the registration command automatically.
+
Include `{ "force": true }` to register a host that has been previously registered to a {SmartProxyServer}.
+
To enter a password as a command line argument, use `username:password` syntax.
Keep in mind this can save the password in the shell history.
Alternatively, you can use a temporary personal access token instead of a password.
To generate a token in the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *My Account* > *Personal Access Tokens*.
. Connect to your host using SSH and run the registration command.

All operators that can be used between _parameter_ and _value_ are listed in the following table.
Other symbols and special characters that might appear in a prediction-built query, such as colons, do not have special meaning and are treated as free text.

.Comparison Operators Accepted by Search
[cols="2,2,4,4a",options="header"]
|====
|Operator |Short Name |Description |Example
| = | EQUALS .2+| Accepts numerical, temporal, or text values.
For text, exact case sensitive matches are returned. .2+| `hostgroup = RHEL7`
| != | NOT EQUALS
| ~ | LIKE .2+| Accepts text or temporal values.
Returns case insensitive matches.
Accepts the following wildcards: _ for a single character, % or * for any number of characters including zero.
If no wildcard is specified, the string is treated as if surrounded by wildcards: %rhel7% .2+| `hostgroup ~ rhel%`
| !~ | NOT LIKE
| &gt; | GREATER THAN .2+| Accepts numerical or temporal values.
For temporal values, the operator &gt; is interpreted as "later than", and &lt; as "earlier than".
Both operators can be combined with EQUALS: &gt;= &lt;= .2+| `registered_at &gt; 10-January-2017`
 +
The search will return hosts that have been registered after the given date, that is, between 10th January 2017 and now.

`registered_at &lt;= Yesterday`
 +
The search will return hosts that have been registered yesterday or earlier.
| &lt; | LESS THAN
| ^ | IN .2+| Compares an expression against a list of values, as in SQL.
Returns matches that contain or not contain the values, respectively. .2+| `release_version !^ 7`
| !^ | NOT IN
| HAS or set? | {nbsp} .2+| Returns values that are present or not present, respectively. .2+| `has hostgroup` or `set? hostgroup`
 +
On the Puppet Classes page, the search will return classes that are assigned to at least one host group.

`not has hostgroup` or `null? hostgroup`
 +
On the Dashboard with an overview of hosts, the search will return all hosts that have no assigned host group.
| NOT HAS or null? | {nbsp}

Simple queries that follow the described syntax can be combined into more complex ones using logical operators AND, OR, and NOT.
Alternative notations of the operators are also accepted:

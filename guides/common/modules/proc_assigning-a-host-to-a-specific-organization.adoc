[NOTE]
====
A mismatch happens if there is a resource associated with a host, such as a domain or subnet, and at the same time not associated with the organization you want to assign the host to.
The option *Fix Organization on Mismatch* will add such a resource to the organization, and is therefore the recommended choice.
The option *Fail on Mismatch* will always result in an error message.
For example, reassigning a host from one organization to another will fail, even if there is no actual mismatch in settings.
====
. Click *Submit*.

= Configuring how many processes can be launched by Apache httpd

By default, HTTPD uses event request handling mechanism.
When the number of requests to httpd exceed the maximum number of child processes that can be launched to handle the incoming connections, httpd raises an HTTP 503 Service Unavailable error.
Amidst httpd running out of processes to handle, the incoming connections can also result in multiple component failure on your Foreman side due to the dependency of components like Pulp on the availability of httpd processes.

You can adapt the configuration of HTTPD event to handle more concurrent requests based on your expected peak load.

. You can modify these values in /etc/foreman-installer/custom-hiera.yaml by changing or adding these lines:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
apache::mod::event::serverlimit: 64
apache::mod::event::maxrequestworkers: 1024
apache::mod::event::maxrequestsperchild: 4000
----
+
These are the numbers installer will apply when using option --tuning=medium.

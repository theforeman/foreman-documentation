= {SmartProxy} networking

The communication between {ProjectServer} and hosts registered to a {SmartProxyServer} is routed through that {SmartProxyServer}.
{SmartProxyServer} also provides {Project} services to hosts.

Integrated {SmartProxy}::
Integrated {SmartProxy} is the {SmartProxy} contained in a {ProjectServer}.
A host that is directly connected to a {ProjectServer} is considered a client of its integrated {SmartProxy}.
This includes the base operating system where the server is running.
These clients need direct network access to {ProjectServer}.

External {SmartProxies}::
External {SmartProxies} are {SmartProxies} not integrated with the {ProjectServer}.
Hosts that are clients of external {SmartProxies} do not need direct access to the Foreman server itself.

Many of the services that {SmartProxyServer} manages use dedicated network ports.
However, {SmartProxyServer} ensures that all communications from the host to {ProjectServer} use a single source IP address, which simplifies firewall administration.

[NOTE]
====
Some outgoing traffic returns to {Project} to enable internal communication and security operations.

{SmartProxy} provides a single endpoint for all host network communications so that in remote network segments, only firewall ports to the {SmartProxy} itself must be open.

hosts connect to {ProjectServer} rather than a {SmartProxy}.
This applies also to {SmartProxies} themselves because the {SmartProxyServer} is a host of {ProjectServer}.

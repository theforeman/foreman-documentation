[id="{smart-proxy-context}-networking"]
= {SmartProxy} networking

The communication between {ProjectServer} and hosts registered to a {SmartProxyServer} is routed through that {SmartProxyServer}.
{SmartProxyServer} also provides {Project} services to hosts.

{SmartProxyServer} provides a single endpoint for all host network communications so that in remote network segments, only firewall ports to the {SmartProxyServer} itself must be open.
Hosts do not need direct access to {ProjectServer}.

hosts need direct network access to {ProjectServer}.
This applies to all {SmartProxyServers} because they are hosts of {ProjectServer}.

= Using container registries

You can use Podman and Docker to fetch content from container registries and push the content to the {Project} container registry.
The {Project} registry follows the Open Containers Initiative (OCI) specification, so you can push content to {Project} by using the same methods that apply to other registries.
For more information about OCI, see link:https://opencontainers.org/[Open Container Initiative Distribution Specification].

.Prerequisites
* To push content to {Project}, ensure your {Project} account has the `edit_products` permission.
* Ensure that a product exists before pushing a repository.
For more information, see xref:Creating_a_Custom_Product_{context}[].
* To pull content from {Project}, ensure that your {Project} account has the `view_lifecycle_environments`, `view_products`, and `view_content_views` permissions, unless the lifecycle environment allows unauthenticated pull.

.Container registries on {SmartProxies}
On {SmartProxies} with content, the https://github.com/Katello/smart_proxy_container_gateway[Container Gateway] {SmartProxy} plugin acts as the container registry.
It caches authentication information from Katello and proxies incoming requests to Pulp.
The Container Gateway is available by default on {SmartProxies} with content.

.Considerations for pushing content to the {Project} container registry
* You can only push content to the {ProjectServer} itself.
If you need pushed content on {SmartProxyServers} as well, use {SmartProxy} syncing.
* The pushed container registry name must contain only lowercase characters.
* Unless pushed repositories are published in a content view version, they do not follow the registry name pattern.
For more information, see xref:Managing_Container_Name_Patterns_{context}[].
This is to ensure that users can push and pull from the same path.
* Users are required to push and pull from the same path.
If you use the label-based schema, pull using labels.
If you use the ID-based schema, pull using IDs.

.Procedure
* Logging in to the container registry:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# podman login {foreman-example-com}
----

* Listing container images:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# podman search {foreman-example-com}/
----

* Pulling container images:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# podman pull {foreman-example-com}/my-image:<optional_tag>
----

* Pushing container images to the {Project} container registry:
- To indicate which organization, product, and repository the container image belongs to, include the organization and product in the container registry name.
- You can address the container destination by using one of the following schemas:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
$ podman push _My_Container_Image_Hash_ _{foreman-example-com}_/_My_Organization_Label_/_My_Product_Label_/_My_Repository_Name_[:_My_Tag_]
$ podman push _My_Container_Image_Hash_ _{foreman-example-com}_/id/_My_Organization_ID_/_My_Product_ID_/_My_Repository_Name_[:_My_Tag_]
----
- After the content push has completed, a repository is created in {Project}.

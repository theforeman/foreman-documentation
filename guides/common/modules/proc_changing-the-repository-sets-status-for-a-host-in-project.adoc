. You can override the default status by using the action menus on each table row by changing the status to *Override to disabled*, *Override to enabled*, or *Reset to default*.

For hosts not in the default content view environment, the *Repository sets* tab shows a toggle group with two options, *Limit to environment* and *Show all*.
The *Limit to environment* option shows only repositories that are relevant to the host.
The *Show all* option shows all available repositories, including those that may not be included in the content view environments of the host.

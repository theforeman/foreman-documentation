= Changing the Repository Sets Status for a Host in {Project}

Repository sets show repositories available to each host.
A host will be able to access content from a given repository if that repository is enabled.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Hosts* > *All Hosts* and select a host.
. Select the *Content* tab, then select the *Repository sets* subtab.
On the tab, there is a set of repositories available to each host with a status of *Enabled* or *Disabled*.
. You can override the default status by using the action menus on each table row by changing the status to *Override to disabled*, *Override to enabled*, or *Reset to default*.
. You can also bulk select the checkboxes on each table row, and use the vertical ellipsis icon at the top.

[NOTE]
====
For hosts not in the default Content View and lifecycle environment, the *Repository sets* tab shows a toggle group with two options, *Limit to environment* and *Show all*.
The *Limit to environment* option shows only repositories that are relevant to the host.
The *Show all* option shows all available repositories including those that may not be in the host's Content View and lifecycle environment.
On the *Overview* tab, click *Content view details* to view the environment for the host.

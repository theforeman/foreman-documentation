|====
| Setting | Default Value | Description
| *Create new host when facts are uploaded* | Yes | {Project} creates the host when new facts are received.
| *Location fact* | {project-context}_location | Hosts created after a Puppet run are placed in the location specified by this fact.
| *Organization fact* | {project-context}_organization | Hosts created after a Puppet run are placed in the organization specified by this fact.
The content of this fact should be the full label of the organization.
| *Default location* | Default Location | Hosts created after a Puppet run that did not send a location fact are placed in this location.
| *Default organization* | Default Organization | Hosts created after a Puppet run that did not send an organization fact are placed in this organization.
| *Update hostgroup from facts* | Yes | {Project} updates a host's hostgroup from its facts.
| *Ignore facts for operating system* | No | Stop updating operating system from facts.
| *Ignore facts for domain* | No | Stop updating domain values from facts.
| *Update subnets from facts* | None | {Project} updates a host's subnet from its facts.
| *Ignore interfaces facts for provisioning* | No | Stop updating IP and MAC address values from facts (affects all interfaces).
| *Ignore interfaces with matching identifier* | [`lo`, `en*v*`, `usb*`, `vnet*`, `macvtap*`, `;vdsmdummy;`, `veth*`, `tap*`, `qbr*`, `qvb*`, `qvo*`, `qr-\*`, `qg-*`, `vlinuxbr*`, `vovsbr*`, `br-int`] | Skip creating or updating host network interfaces objects with identifiers matching these values from incoming facts.
You can use a * wildcard to match identifiers with indexes, e.g. `macvtap*`.
The ignored interface raw facts are still stored in the database, see the *Exclude pattern* setting for more details.
| *Exclude pattern for facts stored in {Project}* | [`lo`, `en*v*`, `usb*`, `vnet*`, `macvtap*`, `;vdsmdummy;`, `veth*`, `tap*`, `qbr*`, `qvb*`, `qvo*`, `qr-\*`, `qg-*`, `vlinuxbr*`, `vovsbr*`, `br-int`, `load_averages::*`, `memory::swap::available*`, `memory::swap::capacity`, `memory::swap::used*`, `memory::system::available*`, `memory::system::capacity`, `memory::system::used*`, `memoryfree`, `memoryfree_mb`, `swapfree`, `swapfree_mb`, `uptime_hours`, `uptime_days`] | Exclude pattern for all types of imported facts (Puppet, Ansible, rhsm).
Those facts are not stored in the {project-context} database.
You can use a * wildcard to match names with indexes, e.g. `ignore*` filters out ignore, ignore123 as well as a::ignore or even a::ignore123::b.
ifndef::satellite[]
| *Default Puppet environment* | production | {Project} defaults to this puppet environment if it cannot auto detect one.
| *ENC environment* | Yes | {Project} explicitly sets the puppet environment in the ENC yaml output.
This avoids conflicts between the environment in `puppet.conf` and the environment set in {Project}.
| *Update environment from facts* | No | {Project} updates a host's environment from its facts.

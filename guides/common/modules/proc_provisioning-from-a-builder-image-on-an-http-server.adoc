When you provision from a {LoraxCompose} image, Anaconda installer partitions disks, downloads and mounts the image, and copies files over to a host.

.Prerequisites
* An existing TAR image created by using {LoraxCompose} in {the-Cockpit}.
Ensure that your blueprint to build the image includes the xref:packages-required-in-a-builder-image[required packages].

.Procedure
. Copy the image to an existing HTTP server that your hosts can reach.
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Configure* > *Host Groups*.
. Select the host group that you want to use.
. Click the *Parameters* tab, and then click *Add Parameter*.
. Create a parameter named `kickstart_liveimg` with type *string* and set the value to the URL of the image location, such as `https://_webserver.example.com_/_path_/_My_Image_Name_.tar`.
. Click *Submit* to save your changes.

When you provision from a {LoraxCompose} image, Anaconda installer partitions disks, downloads and mounts the image, and copies files over to a host.

.Prerequisites
* An existing ISO image created by using {LoraxCompose}.
Ensure that your blueprint to build the image includes a kernel package.

.Procedure
. Copy the ISO image to an existing HTTP server which installed hosts can reach.
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Configure* > *Host Groups*.
. Select the host group that you want to use.
. Click the *Parameters* tab, and then click *Add Parameter*.
. In the *Name* field, enter `kickstart_liveimg`.
. From the *Type* list, select *string*.
. In the *Value* field, enter the URL of the image location, such as `https://_webserver.example.com_/_path_/_image_name.iso_`.
. Click *Submit* to save your changes.

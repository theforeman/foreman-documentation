There are three different ways to use Puppet classes within {Project}.
You can assign Puppet classes to either a single host or multiple hosts using host groupings such as a location based context or Puppet config groups in combination with host groups.

A Puppet module typically consists of several Puppet classes.
You can only assign Puppet classes to hosts.

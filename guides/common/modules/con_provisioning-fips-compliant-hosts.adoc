= Provisioning FIPS-compliant hosts

{Project} supports provisioning hosts that comply with the National Institute of Standards and Technology's https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/fips/140/2/final[Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules] standard, reference number FIPS 140-2, referred to here as FIPS.

To enable the provisioning of hosts that are FIPS-compliant, complete the following tasks:

* Change the provisioning password hashing algorithm for the operating system
* Create a host group and set a host group parameter to enable FIPS

For more information, see {ManagingHostsDocURL}Working_with_Host_Groups_managing-hosts[Creating a Host Group] in _{ManagingHostsDocTitle}_.

The provisioned hosts have the FIPS-compliant settings applied.
To confirm that these settings are enabled, complete the steps in xref:Verifying_FIPS_Mode_Is_Enabled_{context}[].

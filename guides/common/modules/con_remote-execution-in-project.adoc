= Remote execution in {ProjectName}

[role="_abstract"]
With remote execution, you can run jobs on hosts from {SmartProxies} by using shell scripts or Ansible roles and playbooks.

Use remote execution for the following benefits in {Project}:

* Run jobs on multiple hosts at once.
* Use variables in your commands for more granular control over the jobs you run.
* Use host facts and parameters to populate the variable values.
* Specify custom values for templates when you run the command.

Communication for remote execution occurs through {SmartProxyServer}, which means that {ProjectServer} does not require direct access to the target host, and can scale to manage many hosts.

To use remote execution, you must define a job template.
A job template is a command that you want to apply to remote hosts.
You can execute a job template multiple times.

{Project} uses ERB syntax job templates.

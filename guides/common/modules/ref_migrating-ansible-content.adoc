= Migrating Ansible Content

The upgrade from {EL} 7 to {EL} 8 includes an upgrade from Ansible Engine 2.9 to Ansible Core 2.12.

If you have custom Ansible content such as playbooks, job templates inside REX, roles and collections on disk, and you rely on modules being delivered by the Ansible RPM on {Project}, you have to take additional steps to adapt your Ansible installation or migrate your Ansible content.

Ansible Core contains only essential modules.
In terms of FQCN notation `namespace.collection.module`, you can continue to use `ansible.builtin.*`, but everything else is missing in Ansible Core.
That means you will be no longer able to use non-builtin Ansible modules as you were used to and you have to get them from another source, eventually.

You have the following options to handle your Ansible content after the upgrade:

* You can obtain additional community-maintained collections that provide the non-essential functionality from Ansible Galaxy.
For more information, see https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/galaxy/user_guide.html#installing-collections[Installing collections] in the _Galaxy User Guide_.

Note that {Team} does not provide support for this content.
* If you have a subscription for https://www.ansible.com/products/automation-hub[Red Hat Automation Hub], you can configure your `ansible-galaxy` to talk to Automation Hub server and download content from there.
That content is supported by {Team}.
For more information on configuring Automation Hub connection for `ansible-galaxy`, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.1/html/getting_started_with_automation_hub/proc-configure-automation-hub-server-cli[Configuring Red Hat automation hub as the primary source for content].

* You can rewrite your Ansible roles, templates and other affected content.

Note that {Team} does not provide support for content that you maintain yourself.

[NOTE]
====
If you want to download and install Ansible content on {SmartProxy} that does not have a connection to an external Ansible Galaxy server, then you must pass the content through {ProjectServer} instead of using the URL of the Ansible Galaxy server in the configuration on the {SmartProxy} directly:

. Sync the content from a Ansible Galaxy server to a custom repository on your {ProjectServer}.
. Configure Ansible on your {SmartProxy} to download the content from {ProjectServer}.

// Not packaged with RHEL8 yet
To find out what content is affected after the upgrade, you can run:

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# ansible-lint --enable-list only-builtins -p _path/to/your/playbook/play.yml_

You need `ansible-lint` 6.1.0 or newer.
You can install it from https://pypi.org/project/ansible-lint/[pypi.org].

= Creating hosts on {CRname} by using {ProjectWebUI}

[role="_abstract"]
In {Project}, you can use {CRname} provisioning to create hosts over a network connection or from an existing image.

.Prerequisites
* For network-based provisioning, if you use a virtual network on the {CRname} server for provisioning, select a network that does not provide DHCP assignments.
* This causes DHCP conflicts with {ProjectServer} when booting new hosts.
* If you want to create a host over a network connection, the new host must be able to access your {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServers} on a {CRname} virtual network, so that the host has access to PXE provisioning services.
This new host entry triggers the {CRname} server to create and start a virtual machine.
If the virtual machine detects the defined {SmartProxyServer} through the virtual network, the virtual machine boots to PXE and begins to install the chosen operating system.

* If you want to create a host with an existing image, the new host entry triggers the {CRname} server to create the virtual machine using a pre-existing image as a basis for the new volume.

.Procedure

. From the *Deploy on* list, select the {CRname} connection.
. From the *Compute Profile* list, select a profile to use to automatically populate virtual machine settings.
The {CRname}-specific fields are populated with settings from your compute profile.
Modify these settings if required.

. Click the *Operating System* tab, and confirm that all fields automatically contain values.
. Select the *Provisioning Method* that you want to use:
* For network-based provisioning, click *Network Based*.
* For image-based provisioning, click *Image Based*.
. Click *Resolve* in *Provisioning templates* to check the new host can identify the right provisioning templates to use.
. Click the *Virtual Machine* tab and confirm that these settings are populated with details from the host group and compute profile.
Modify these settings to suit your needs.

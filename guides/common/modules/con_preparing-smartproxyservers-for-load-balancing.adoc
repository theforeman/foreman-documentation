= Preparing {SmartProxyServers} for load balancing

[role="_abstract"]
Before you can configure load balancing in your {Project} environment, you must install a new {SmartProxyServer}.
This is the {SmartProxyServer} that you will later configure for load balancing.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{Project} does not support configuring existing {SmartProxyServers} for load balancing.
You must create a new {SmartProxyServer} for this purpose.

= Configuring {SmartProxy} for Host Registration and Provisioning

Use this procedure to configure {SmartProxy} so that you can register and provision hosts using your {SmartProxyServer} instead of your {ProjectServer}.

.Procedure
ifdef::foreman-deb,foreman-el[]
. Enable the Registration and Templates features on your {SmartProxyServer} and set the template URL:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# {installer-scenario-smartproxy} \
--foreman-proxy-registration true \
--foreman-proxy-templates true \
--foreman-proxy-template-url "https://_{smartproxy-example-com}_:8000"
----
. On your {SmartProxyServer}, open the corresponding ports:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=8000/tcp
# firewall-cmd --reload
----
. On {ProjectServer}, add the {SmartProxy} to the list of trusted proxies.
endif::[]
ifndef::foreman-deb,foreman-el[]
* On {ProjectServer}, add the {SmartProxy} to the list of trusted proxies.
endif::[]
+
This is required for {Project} to recognize hosts' IP addresses forwarded over the `X-Forwarded-For` HTTP header set by {SmartProxy}.
For security reasons, {Project} recognizes this HTTP header only from localhost by default.
You can enter trusted proxies as valid IPv4 or IPv6 addresses of {SmartProxies}, or network ranges.
+
WARNING: Do not use a network range that is too wide, because this poses a potential security risk.
+
Enter the following command.
Note that the command overwrites the list that is currently stored in {Project}.
Therefore, if you have set any trusted proxies previously, you must include them in the command as well:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-installer} \
--foreman-trusted-proxies "127.0.0.1/8" \
--foreman-trusted-proxies "::1" \
--foreman-trusted-proxies "_My_IP_address_" \
--foreman-trusted-proxies "_My_IP_range_"
----
+
The localhost entries are required, do not omit them.

.Verification
. List the current trusted proxies using the full help of {Project} installer:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-installer} --full-help | grep -A 2 "trusted-proxies"
----
. The current listing contains all trusted proxies you require.

= HTTP authentication overview

All requests to the {Project} API require a valid {Project} user name and password.
The API uses Basic HTTP authentication to encode these credentials and add to the `Authorization` header.
For more information about Basic authentication, see http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2617[RFC 2617 HTTP Authentication: Basic and Digest Access Authentication].
If a request does not include an appropriate `Authorization` header, the API returns a `401 Authorization Required` error.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Basic authentication involves potentially sensitive information, for example, it sends passwords as plain text.
The REST API requires HTTPS for transport-level encryption of plain text requests.
====

Some base64 libraries break encoded credentials into multiple lines and terminate each line with a newline character.
This invalidates the header and causes a faulty request.
The `Authorization` header requires the encoded credentials to be on a single line within the header.

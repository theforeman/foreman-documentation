= Lifecycle status of RHEL hosts

{Project} provides multiple mechanisms to display information about upcoming End of Support (EOS) events for your {RHEL} hosts:

* Notification banner
* A column on the Hosts index page
* Alert on the Hosts index page for each host that runs {RHEL} with an upcoming EOS event in a year as well as when support has ended
* Ability to *Search* for hosts by EOS on the Hosts index page
* *Host status* card on the host details page

For any hosts that are not running {RHEL}, {Project} displays *Unknown* in the *RHEL Lifecycle status* and *Last report* columns.

.EOS notification banner
When either the end of maintenance support or the end of extended lifecycle support approaches in a year, you will see a notification banner in the {ProjectWebUI} if you have hosts with that {RHEL} version.
The notification provides information about the {RHEL} version, the number of hosts running that version in your environment, the lifecycle support, and the expiration date.
Along with other information, the {RHEL} lifecycle column is visible in the notification.

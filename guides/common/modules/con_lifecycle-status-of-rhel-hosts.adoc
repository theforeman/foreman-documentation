= Lifecycle status of RHEL hosts

[role="_abstract"]
With {Project}, you can monitor the lifecycle status of your hosts by displaying upcoming End of Support (EOS) events.
This is useful so that you can quickly identify which hosts require an update or action to maintain support.

{Project} provides multiple mechanisms to display information about upcoming EOS events for your {RHEL} hosts:

* Notification banner
* A column on the Hosts index page
* Alert on the Hosts index page for each host that runs {RHEL} with an upcoming EOS event in a year as well as when support has ended
* Ability to *Search* for hosts by EOS on the Hosts index page
* *Host status* card on the host details page

For any hosts that are not running {RHEL}, {Project} displays *Unknown* in the *RHEL Lifecycle status* and *Last report* columns.

When either the end of maintenance support or the end of extended lifecycle support approaches in a year, you will see a notification banner in the {ProjectWebUI} if you have hosts with that {RHEL} version.
The notification provides information about the {RHEL} version, the number of hosts running that version in your environment, the lifecycle support, and the expiration date.
Along with other information, the {RHEL} lifecycle column is visible in the notification.

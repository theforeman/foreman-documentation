= Managing content view environments

A content view environment combines a specific lifecycle environment with a content view and describes which version of the content view to use.
You can assign hosts and activation keys to one or more content view environments instead of assigning lifecycle environments and content views separately.
When you assign a host to multiple content view environments, the host gains access to the combined repositories from all its associated content view environments.

You can assign multiple content view environments to hosts from the server using Hammer or from the host using Subscription Manager.
You can also view content view environment assignments in both Hammer and the web UI.

You also have the option to assign multiple content view environments to an activation key to give hosts access to content from each environment.

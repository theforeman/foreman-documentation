= Managing content view environments

[role="_abstract"]
A content view environment combines a specific lifecycle environment with a content view and describes which version of the content view to use.
You can assign hosts and activation keys to one or more content view environments instead of assigning lifecycle environments and content views separately.
When you assign a host to multiple content view environments, the host gains access to the combined repositories from all its associated content view environments.

You can also assign multiple content view environments to an activation key to give hosts access to content during host registration.

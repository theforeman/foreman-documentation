[id="Configuring_FreeIPA_Authentication_on_Server_{context}"]
= Configuring {FreeIPA} Authentication on {ProjectServer}

In the {Project} CLI, configure {FreeIPA} authentication by first creating a host entry on the {FreeIPA} server.

.Procedure
. On the {FreeIPA} server, to authenticate, enter the following command and enter your password when prompted:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# kinit _admin_
----
. To verify that you have authenticated, enter the following command:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# klist
----
. On the {FreeIPA} server, create a host entry for {ProjectServer} and generate a one-time password, for example:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# ipa host-add --random _hostname_
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The generated one-time password must be used on the client to complete {FreeIPA}-enrollment.

endif::[]
. Create an HTTP service for {ProjectServer}, for example:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# ipa service-add HTTP/_hostname_
----
+

. On {ProjectServer}, install the IPA client:

[WARNING]
====
This command might restart {Project} services during the installation of the package.
For more information about installing and updating packages on {Project}, see {AdministeringDocURL}Managing_Packages_on_the_Base_Operating_System_admin[Managing Packages on the Base Operating System of {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer}] in _{AdministeringDocTitle}_.

[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# {package-install-project} ipa-client
----
. On {ProjectServer}, enter the following command as root to configure {FreeIPA}-enrollment:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# ipa-client-install --password _OTP_
----
+
Replace _OTP_ with the one-time password provided by the {FreeIPA} administrator.
ifdef::foreman-deb[]
. Ensure that the hostname is set to the fully qualified domain name (FQDN); the short name is not sufficient:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# hostname
{foreman-example-com}
----
+
Otherwise, {foreman-installer} cannot generate the right principal name that is needed to join the realm.
endif::[]
. Set {FreeIPA} as the authentication provider, using one of the following commands:
** If you only want to enable access to the {ProjectWebUI} but not the {Project} API, enter:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-installer} \
--foreman-ipa-authentication=true
----
** If you want to enable access both to the {ProjectWebUI} and the {Project} API, enter:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-installer} \
--foreman-ipa-authentication-api=true \
--foreman-ipa-authentication=true
----
+
[WARNING]
====
Enabling access to both the {Project} API and the {ProjectWebUI} can lead to security problems.
After an IdM user receives a Kerberos ticket-granting ticket (TGT) by entering `kinit _user_name_`, an attacker can obtain an API session.
The attack is possible even if the user did not previously enter the {Project} login credentials anywhere, for example in the browser.
====
. Restart {Project} services:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} service restart
----

External users can now log in to {Project} using their {FreeIPA} credentials.
They can now choose to either log in to {ProjectServer} directly using their username and password or take advantage of the configured Kerberos single sign-on and obtain a ticket on their client machine and be logged in automatically.
The two-factor authentication with one-time password (2FA OTP) is also supported.

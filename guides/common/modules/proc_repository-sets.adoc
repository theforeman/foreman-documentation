[id="Repository_Sets_{context}"]
= Repository Sets in {Project}

Repository sets show available repositories to each host. If your host is subscribed to a particular Content View and Lifecycle environment, the default repository set is limited to the repositories that are specifically available to that host.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Hosts* to choose from a list of available hosts.
. Select a host and navigate to the *Repository sets* tab.
. On the *Repository sets* tab, there is a set of available repositories available to each host with a default status of *Enabled* and *Disabled*.
. You can override the default status by using the action menus on each table row by changing the status to *Override to disabled*, *Override to enabled*, or *Reset to default*.
. Navigate to the *Overview* tab to *Content view details* to view the environment for the host.
[NOTE]
====
For hosts not in a default view or a lifecycle environment, the repository tab looks different.
It will default to showing only the repositories that are relevant to the host.

. Select *Show all* or *Limit to environment* to view available repositories.

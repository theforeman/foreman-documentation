endif::[]

ifndef::satellite[]
DEB Packages::
Import DEB packages from repositories, for example for Debian or Ubuntu.
You can also import single DEB packages or synchronize custom repositories.

endif::[]

Kickstart Trees::
Import the kickstart trees for creating a system.
New systems access these kickstart trees over a network to use as base content for their installation.
{ProjectNameX} also contains some predefined kickstart templates as well as the ability to create your own, which are used to provision systems and customize the installation.

You can also manage other types of {customcontent} in {Project}.
For example:

ISO and KVM Images::
Download and manage media for installation and provisioning.
For example, {Project} downloads, stores, and manages ISO images and guest images for specific {RHEL} and non-Red Hat operating systems.

You can use the procedure to add {customcontent} for any type of content you require, for example, SSL certificates and OVAL files.

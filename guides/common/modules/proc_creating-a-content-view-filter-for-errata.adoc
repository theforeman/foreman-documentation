= Creating a Content View Filter for Errata

You can use content filters to limit errata.
Such filters include:

* *ID* - Select specific erratum to allow into your resulting repositories.
* *Date Range* - Define a date range and include a set of errata released during that date range.
* *Type* - Select the type of errata to include such as bug fixes, enhancements, and security updates.

Create a content filter to exclude errata after a certain date.
This ensures your production systems in the application life cycle are kept up to date to a certain point.
Then you can modify the filter's start date to introduce new errata into your testing environment to test the compatibility of new packages into your application life cycle.

To use the CLI instead of the {ProjectWebUI}, see the xref:cli-creating-a-content-view-filter-for-errata[].

.Prerequisites
* A Content View with the repositories that contain required errata is created.
For more information, see xref:Creating_a_Content_View_{context}[].

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Content* > *Content Views* and select a Content View that you want to use for applying errata.
. Select *Yum Content* > *Filters* and click *New Filter*.
. In the *Name* field, enter `Errata Filter`.
. From the *Content Type* list, select *Erratum - Date and Type*.
. From the *Inclusion Type* list, select *Exclude*.
. In the *Description* field, enter `Exclude errata items from YYYY-MM-DD`.
. Click *Save*.
. For *Errata Type*, select the checkboxes of errata types you want to exclude.
For example, select the *Enhancement* and *Bugfix* checkboxes and clear the *Security* checkbox to exclude enhancement and bugfix errata after certain date, but include all the security errata.
. For *Date Type*, select one of two checkboxes:
+
* *Issued On* for the issued date of the erratum.
+
* *Updated On* for the date of the erratumâ€™s last update.

. Select the *Start Date* to exclude all errata on or after the selected date.
. Leave the *End Date* field blank.
. Click *Save*.
. Click *Publish New Version* to publish the resulting repository.
. Enter `Adding errata filter` in the *Description* field.
. Click *Save*.
+
When the Content View completes publication, notice the *Content* column reports a reduced number of packages and errata from the initial repository.
This means the filter successfully excluded the all non-security errata from the last year.

. Click the *Versions* tab.
. Click *Promote* to the right of the published version.
. Select the environments you want to promote the Content View version to.
. In the *Description* field, enter the description for promoting.
. Click *Promote Version* to promote this Content View version across the required environments.

.CLI procedure

. Create a filter for the errata:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer content-view filter create --name "_Filter Name_" \
--description "Exclude errata items from the _YYYY-MM-DD_" \
--content-view "_CV Name_" --organization "_Default Organization_" \
--type "erratum"
----
. Create a filter rule to exclude all errata on or after the _Start Date_ that you want to set:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer content-view filter rule create --start-date "_YYYY-MM-DD_" \
--content-view "_CV Name_" --content-view-filter="_Filter Name_" \
--organization "_Default Organization_" --types=security,enhancement,bugfix
----
. Publish the Content View:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer content-view publish --name "_CV Name_" \
--organization "_Default Organization_"
----
. Promote the Content View to the lifecycle environment so that the included errata are available to that lifecycle environment:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer content-view version promote \
--content-view "_CV Name_" \
--organization "_Default Organization_" \
--to-lifecycle-environment "_Lifecycle Environment Name_"

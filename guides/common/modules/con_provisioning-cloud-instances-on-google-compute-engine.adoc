include::snip_common-compute-resource-prereqs.adoc[]
* In your GCE project, configure a service account with the necessary IAM Compute role.
For more information, see https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/iam[Compute Engine IAM roles] in the GCE documentation.
* In your GCE project-wise metadata, set the `enable-oslogin` to `FALSE`.
For more information, see https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/managing-instance-access#enable_oslogin[Enabling or disabling OS Login] in the GCE documentation.
* Optional: If you want to use Puppet with GCE hosts, navigate to *Administer*{nbsp}>{nbsp}*Settings* > *Puppet* and enable the `Use UUID for certificates` setting to configure Puppet to use consistent Puppet certificate IDs.
* Based on your needs, associate a `finish` or `user_data` provisioning template with the operating system you want to use.

= SCAP Content

SCAP content is a SCAP data-stream file that contains implementation of compliance, configuration, or security baselines.
A single data stream usually includes multiple XCCDF profiles.
An XCCDF profile defines an industry standard or custom security standard against which you can evaluate compliance of host configuration in {Project}.
You can adapt existing XCCDF profiles according to your requirements using _tailoring files_.

In {Project}, you use an XCCDF profile from SCAP content and, eventually, a tailoring file, to define a _compliance policy_.
{Project} includes default SCAP contents from SCAP Security Guide provided by the https://www.open-scap.org/[OpenSCAP project].

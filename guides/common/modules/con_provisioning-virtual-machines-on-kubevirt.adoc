[id="Provisioning_Virtual_Machines_Kubevirt_{context}"]
= Provisioning virtual machines on {KubeVirt}

{KubeVirt} addresses the needs of development teams that have adopted or want to adopt {Kubernetesfirst} but possess existing virtual machine (VM) workloads that cannot be easily containerized.
This technology provides a unified development platform where developers can build, modify, and deploy applications residing in application containers and VMs in a shared environment.
These capabilities support rapid application modernization across the open hybrid cloud.

With {Project}, you can create a compute resource for {KubeVirt} so that you can provision and manage virtual machines in {Kubernetes} by using {Project}.

Note that template provisioning is not supported for this release.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The {KubeVirt} compute resource is a Technology Preview feature only.
Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete.
Red Hat does not recommend using them in production.
These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.
For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/.

.Prerequisites
include::snip_prerequisites-common-compute-resource.adoc[]
* You must have `cluster-admin` permissions for the {Kubernetes} cluster.
* A {SmartProxyServer} managing a network on the {Kubernetes} cluster.
Ensure that no other DHCP services run on this network to avoid conflicts with {SmartProxyServer}.
For more information about network service configuration for {SmartProxyServers}, see {ProvisioningDocURL}Configuring_Networking_provisioning[Configuring Networking] in _{ProvisioningDocTitle}_.

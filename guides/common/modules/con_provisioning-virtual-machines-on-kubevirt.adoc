[id="Provisioning_Virtual_Machines_Kubevirt_{context}"]
= Provisioning virtual machines on {KubeVirt}

{KubeVirt} addresses the needs of development teams that have adopted or want to adopt {Kubernetesfirst} but possess existing virtual machine (VM) workloads that cannot be easily containerized.
This technology provides a unified development platform where developers can build, modify, and deploy applications residing in application containers and VMs in a shared environment.
These capabilities support rapid application modernization across the open hybrid cloud.

You can create a compute resource for {KubeVirt} so that you can provision and manage virtual machines in {Kubernetes} by using {Project}.

.Prerequisites
include::snip_prerequisites-common-compute-resource.adoc[]
* You must have `cluster-admin` permissions for the {Kubernetes} cluster.
* A {SmartProxyServer} managing a network on the {Kubernetes} cluster.
Ensure that no other DHCP services run on this network to avoid conflicts with {SmartProxyServer}.
For more information about network service configuration for {SmartProxyServers}, see {ProvisioningDocURL}preparing-networking[Preparing networking] in _{ProvisioningDocTitle}_.

.Additional resources
* For a list of permissions a non-admin user requires to provision hosts, see xref:permissions-required-to-provision-hosts_provisioning[].

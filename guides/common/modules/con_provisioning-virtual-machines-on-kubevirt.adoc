= Provisioning virtual machines on {KubeVirt}

[role="_abstract"]
{KubeVirt} addresses the needs of development teams that have adopted or want to adopt {Kubernetesfirst} but possess existing virtual machine (VM) workloads that cannot be easily containerized.
This technology provides a unified development platform where developers can build, modify, and deploy applications residing in application containers and VMs in a shared environment.
These capabilities support rapid application modernization across the open hybrid cloud.

You can create a compute resource for {KubeVirt} so that you can provision and manage virtual machines in {Kubernetes} by using {Project}.

Note that template provisioning is not supported for this release.

Before you start provisioning virtual machines on {KubeVirt}, ensure that your environment meets the following requirements:
 
include::snip_prerequisites-common-compute-resource.adoc[]
* You must have the `get`, `delete`, `create`, `update`, `patch`, `list`, and `watch` permissions for VMs and other {KubeVirt} resources for the {Kubernetes} cluster in the specified namespace.
You can get these permissions with the `kubevirt.io:edit` cluster role.
For more information on {KubeVirt} cluster roles, see

* To use auto-completion for network selection, you must have the `get` and `list` permissions for `network-attachment-definitions.k8s.cni.cncf.io`.
* A {SmartProxyServer} managing a network on the {Kubernetes} cluster.
Ensure that no other DHCP services run on this network to avoid conflicts with {SmartProxyServer}.
For more information about network service configuration for {SmartProxyServers}, see {ProvisioningDocURL}preparing-networking[Preparing networking] in _{ProvisioningDocTitle}_.
* Ensure the provisioning user has the required permissions to provision hosts.
For more information, see xref:permissions-required-to-provision-hosts[].

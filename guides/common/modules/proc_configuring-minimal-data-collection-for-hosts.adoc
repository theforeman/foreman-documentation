= Configuring Minimal data collection for hosts

You can configure a host in {Project} to use minimal reporting if you want to limit the data sent to Subscription Watch and disable Insights integration.
This option allows you to limit the amount of system data sent to Red{nbsp}Hat while still supporting Subscription Watch.

.Prerequisites
* Ensure existing data in Insights Inventory is deleted before switching a host to minimal reporting.
* You have selected an organization and location.       

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Insights* > *Inventory Upload*.
. Select the *Minimal data collection* setting from the dropdown menu under *Settings*. 
The settings cannot be changed for *Minimal data collection*.
+
[NOTE]
====
Switching from *Minimal data collection* to *Optional data collection* enables all of the settings. 
Review and adjust these settings as needed if you do not want to share certain types of host data.
====
. Click the *Generate and upload report* button.
+
[NOTE]
====
When you configure a host to use *Minimal data collection*, Red{nbsp}Hat Insights is disabled and does not receive any data.  
Only Subscription Watch continues to operate with reports processed once every day during the midnight synchronization cycle.
====
+
[WARNING]
====
If *Automatic mismatch deletion* is enabled, {Project} removes any hosts from the {RHCloud} that are not registered in {Project}. 
Enable this setting only when all hosts are registered through {Project}. 
If any hosts are registered through other {Project} instances or directly to the {RHCloud}, {Project} deletes them.

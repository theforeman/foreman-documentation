= Configuring Minimal data collection for hosts

You can configure a host in {Project} to use minimal reporting if you want to limit the data sent to subscriptions service and disable Insights integration.
This option allows you to limit the amount of system data sent to Red{nbsp}Hat while still supporting subscriptions service.

.Prerequisites
* Ensure existing data in Insights Inventory is deleted before switching a host to minimal reporting.
To remove the system, go to *Inventory* > *Systems* in the {RHCloud}, select the systems, and click *Delete*.
* You have selected an organization and location.       

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Insights* > *Inventory Upload*.
. Select the *Minimal data collection* setting from the dropdown menu under *Settings*.
When you select this option, {Project} also updates the corresponding setting on the *Insights* tab under *Administer* > *Settings*. 
You can also enable this setting by navigating to *Administer* > *Settings*, and on the *Insights* tab, setting *Minimal data collection* to *Yes*. 
When you select *Minimal data collection*, {Project} does not include hostnames or IP addresses in the report, so the settings to obfuscate this information do not apply. 
{Project} also ignores the setting to exclude installed packages, as it always excludes them from reports at this level.

[NOTE]
====
Switching from *Minimal data collection* to *Optional data collection* enables all of the settings. 
Review and adjust these settings as needed if you do not want to share certain types of host data.
====
. Click the *Generate and upload report* button.
+
[NOTE]
====
When you configure a host to use *Minimal data collection*, only the subscriptions service remains active, with reports processed daily during the midnight synchronization cycle. 
Other Insights services are disabled because they require installed package data, which minimal reports do not include.
====

[WARNING]
====
If *Automatic mismatch deletion* is enabled, {Project} removes any hosts from the {RHCloud} that are not registered in {Project}. 
Enable this setting only when all hosts are registered through {Project}. 
If any hosts are registered through other {Project} instances or directly to the {RHCloud}, {Project} deletes them.

= Inclusion of Remote SCAP Resources

SCAP data streams can reference remote resources, such as OVAL files, that the SCAP client fetches over the internet when it runs on hosts.
If a data stream requires a remote resource, you can see a warning from the OpenSCAP Scanner tool on your {ProjectServer}, such as:

[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# oscap info _/usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-rhel8-ds.xml_ | grep "WARNING"
WARNING: Datastream component 'scap_org.open-scap_cref_security-data-oval-com.redhat.rhsa-RHEL8.xml.bz2'
points out to the remote 'https://access.redhat.com/security/data/oval/com.redhat.rhsa-RHEL8.xml.bz2'.
Use '--fetch-remote-resources' option to download it.
WARNING: Skipping 'https://access.redhat.com/security/data/oval/com.redhat.rhsa-RHEL8.xml.bz2' file
which is referenced from datastream
----

By default, the SCAP client is configured to ignore the remote resources and skip the XCCDF rules that rely on the resources.
The skipped rules then result in the `notchecked` status.
In a connected network environment, you can enable the download of remote resources on hosts in {Project}.

Using the Ansible deployment method::
Override the following Ansible variable:

* Name: `foreman_scap_client_fetch_remote_resources`
* Type: `boolean`
* Value: `true`

+

Using the Puppet deployment method::
Configure the following Puppet Smart Class Parameter:

* Name: `fetch_remote_resources`
* Type: `boolean`
* Value: `true`

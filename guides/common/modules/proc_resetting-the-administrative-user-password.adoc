= Resetting the administrative user password

[role="_abstract"]
You can reset the administrative password to randomly generated characters or set a new administrative password.
This might be useful when you forget the password or when the administrative user is deleted.

.Procedure
* To reset the administrative user password:
.. Log in to the base operating system where {ProjectServer} is installed.
.. Reset the password for the `admin` user:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# foreman-rake permissions:reset
Reset to user: admin, password: qwJxBptxb7Gfcjj5
----
.. Use this password to reset the password in the {ProjectWebUI}.
.. To use the new password with the Hammer CLI, add the password to the `~/.hammer/cli.modules.d/foreman.yml` file on {ProjectServer}:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# vi ~/.hammer/cli.modules.d/foreman.yml
----

* To set a new administrative user password:
.. Log in to the base operating system where {ProjectServer} is installed.
.. To set the password for a user, enter the following command:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# foreman-rake permissions:reset username=_user_ password=_new_password_
----
+
Replace `_user_` with the username whose password you want to reset.

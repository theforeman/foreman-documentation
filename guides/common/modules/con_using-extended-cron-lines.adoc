= Using Extended Cron Lines

When scheduling a cron job with remote execution, you can use an extended cron line to specify the cadence of the job.
The standard cron line contains five fields that specify minute, hour, day of the month, month, and day of the week.
For example, `0 5 * * *`` stands for every day at 5 AM.

The extended cron line provides the following features:

You can use `#` to specify a concrete week day in a month::
For example:
+
* `0 0 * * mon#1` specifies first Monday of the month
* `0 0 * * fri#3,fri#4` specifies 3rd and 4th Fridays of the month
* `0 7 * * fri#-1` specifies the last Friday of the month at 07:00
* `0 7 * * fri#L` also specifies the last Friday of the month at 07:00
* `0 23 * * mon#2,tue` specifies the 2nd Monday of the month and every Tuesday, at 23:00

You can use `%` to specify every n-th day of the month::
For example:
+
* `9 0 * * sun%2` specifies every other Sunday at 00:09
* `0 0 * * sun%2+1` specifies every odd Sunday
* `9 0 * * sun%2,tue%3` specifies every other Sunday and every third Tuesday

You can use `&` to specify that the day of the month has to match the day of the week::
For example:
+
* `0 0 30 * 1&` specifies 30th day of the month, but only if it is Monday

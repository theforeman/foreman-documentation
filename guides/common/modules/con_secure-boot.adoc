= Secure Boot

When {Project} is installed on {EL} using `{foreman-installer}`, grub2 and shim boot loaders that are signed by Red Hat are deployed into the TFTP and HTTP UEFI Boot directory.
PXE loader options named "SecureBoot" configure hosts to load `shim.efi`.

On Debian and Ubuntu operating systems, the grub2 boot loader is created using the `grub2-mkimage` unsigned.
To perform the Secure Boot, the boot loader must be manually signed and key enrolled into the EFI firmware.
Alternatively, grub2 from Ubuntu or {EL} can be copied to perform booting.

Grub2 in {EL} 8.0-8.3 were updated to mitigate https://access.redhat.com/security/vulnerabilities/grub2bootloader[Boot Hole Vulnerability] and keys of existing {EL} kernels were invalidated.
To boot any of the affected {EL} kernel (or operating system installer), you must enroll keys manually into the EFI firmware for each host:

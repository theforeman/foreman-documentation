= Creating a Content View

Use this procedure to create a simple Content View.
To use the CLI instead of the {ProjectWebUI}, see the xref:cli-creating-a-content-view_{context}[].

.Prerequisites

While you can stipulate whether you want to resolve any package dependencies on a Content View by Content View basis, you might want to change the default {Project} settings to enable or disable package resolution for all Content Views.
For more information, see xref:Resolving_Package_Dependencies_{context}[].

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Content* > *Content Views* and click *Create content view*.
. In the *Name* field, enter a name for the view.
{Project} automatically completes the *Label* field from the name you enter.
. In the *Description* field, enter a description of the view.
. In the *Type* field, select a *Content view* or a *Composite content view*.
. Optional: If you want to solve dependencies automatically every time you publish this Content View, select the *Solve dependencies* checkbox.
Dependency solving slows the publishing time and might ignore any Content View filters you use.
This can also cause errors when resolving dependencies for errata.
. Optional: If you want to designate this Content View for importing from an upstream server, select the *Import only* checkbox.
Import-only content views cannot be published directly.
. Click *Create content view*.

.Content View Steps
. Click *Create content view* to create the Content View.
. In the *Repositories* tab, select the repository from the *Type* list that you want to add to your Content View, select the checkbox next to the available repositories you want to add, then click *Add repositories*.
. Click *Publish new version* and in the *Description* field, enter information about the version to log changes.
. Optional: You can enable a promotion path by clicking *Promote* to *Select a lifecycle environment from the available promotion paths to promote new version*.
. Click *Next*.
. On the *Review* page, you can review the environments you are trying to publish.
. Click *Finish*.
+
[NOTE]
*Remove* and *Delete* are similar but the *Delete* option deletes an entire Content View and the versions associated with that lifecycle environment.
The *Remove* option allows you to choose which version you want removed from the lifecycle environment.

You can view the Content View in the Content Views window.
To view more information about the Content View, click the Content View name.
To register a host to your Content View, see {ManagingHostsDocURL}Registering_Hosts_managing-hosts[Registering Hosts] in _{ManagingHostsDocTitle}_.

.CLI procedure
. Obtain a list of repository IDs:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# hammer repository list --organization "_My_Organization_"
----
. Create the Content View and add repositories:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# hammer content-view create \
--description "_My_Content_View_" \
--name "_My_Content_View_" \
--organization "_My_Organization_" \
--repository-ids 1,2

For the `--repository-ids` option, you can find the IDs in the output of the `hammer repository list` command.
. Publish the view:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# hammer content-view publish \
--description "_My_Content_View_" \
--name "_My_Content_View_" \
--organization "_My_Organization_"
----
. Optional: To add a repository to an existing Content View, enter the following command:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
#Â hammer content-view add-repository \
--name "_My_Content_View_" \
--organization "_My_Organization_" \
--repository-id _repository_ID_
----

{ProjectServer} creates the new version of the view and publishes it to the Library environment.

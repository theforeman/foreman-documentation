= Including Power Actions in Templates

This example shows how to set up a job template for performing power actions, such as reboot. This procedure prevents {Project} from interpreting the disconnect exception upon reboot as an error, and consequently, remote execution of the job works correctly.

Create a new template as described in xref:setting-up-job-templates_{context}[], and specify the following string in the template editor:

[source, Ruby]
----
<%= render_template("Power Action - SSH Default", :action => "restart") %>
----

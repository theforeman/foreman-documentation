= Limitations of {Project} Installation in an IPv6 Network

{Project} installation in an IPv6 network has the following limitations:

* You can install {Project} and {SmartProxies} in IPv6-only systems, dual-stack installation is not supported.

* Although {Project} provisioning templates include IPv6 support for PXE and HTTP (iPXE) provisioning, the only tested and certified provisioning workflow is the UEFI HTTP Boot provisioning.
This limitation only relates to users who plan to use {Project} to provision hosts.

* {Project} does not support configuring an HTTP proxy using a direct IPv6 address.
Instead, configure the HTTP proxy with a FQDN that resolves to the IPv6 address.
Using an IPv6 address as the HTTP proxy URL causes it to fail.

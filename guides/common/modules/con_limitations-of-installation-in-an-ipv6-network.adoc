= Limitations of {Project} Installation in an IPv6 Network 

{Project} installation in an IPv6 network has the following limitations:

* You can install {Project} and {SmartProxies} in IPv6-only systems, dual-stack installation is not supported.

* Although {Project} provisioning templates include IPv6 support for PXE and HTTP (iPXE) provisioning, the only tested and certified provisioning workflow is the UEFI HTTP Boot provisioning. This limitation only relates to users who plan to use {Project} to provision hosts.

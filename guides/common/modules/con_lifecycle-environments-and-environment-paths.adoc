= Lifecycle environments and environment paths

Application lifecycles are divided into lifecycle environments which represent each stage of the application lifecycle.
By linking lifecycle environments, you create an environment path.

You can promote content along the environment path to the next lifecycle environment when required.
When you promote a content view from one environment to the next environment in the application lifecycle, {Project} updates the repository and publishes the packages.
For example, if development ends on a particular version of an application, you can promote this version to the testing environment and start development on the next version.

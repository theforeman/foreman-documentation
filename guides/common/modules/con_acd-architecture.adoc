ACD uses {SmartProxies} and a remote execution provider called `acd`.

Ansible playbooks are downloaded from {ProjectServer} to {SmartProxyServer} before being executed.
Submit any Ansible playbooks that you want to use to {ProjectServer}.
You do not have to manually add Ansible playbooks to {SmartProxyServers}.

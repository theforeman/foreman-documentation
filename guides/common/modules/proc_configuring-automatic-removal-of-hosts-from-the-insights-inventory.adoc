= Configuring Automatic Removal of Hosts from the Insights Inventory

When hosts are removed from {Project}, they can also be removed from the inventory of Red{nbsp}Hat Insights, either automatically or manually.
You can configure automatic removal of hosts from the Insights Inventory during {RHCloud} synchronization with {Project} that occurs daily by default.
If you leave the setting disabled, you can still remove the bulk of hosts from the Inventory manually.

.Prerequisite
* Your user account must have a role assigned that grants the `view_settings` and `edit_settings` permissions.

[NOTE]
====
These permissions can be set from the Settings page or from the Inventory Upload page in {ProjectWebUI}.
If you choose the latter, you must have the permission of `view_foreman_rh_cloud` to access it.
====

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Configure* > *Inventory Upload*.
. Enable the *Automatic Mismatch Deletion* setting.

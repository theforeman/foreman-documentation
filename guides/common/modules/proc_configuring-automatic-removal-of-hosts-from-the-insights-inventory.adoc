= Configuring Automatic Removal of Hosts from the Insights Inventory

When hosts are removed from {Project}, they can also be removed from the inventory of Red{nbsp}Hat Insights, either automatically or manually.
You can configure automatic removal of hosts from the Insights Inventory during {RHCloud} synchronization with {Project} that occurs daily by default.
If you leave the setting disabled, you can still remove the bulk of hosts from the Inventory manually.

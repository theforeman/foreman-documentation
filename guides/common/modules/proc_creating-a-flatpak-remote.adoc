= Creating a Flatpak remote

You can create a Flatpak remote to access and manage Flatpak repositories in {Project}.

.Prerequisites
 * Your {Project} account has a role that grants the permissions `view_flatpak_remotes`, `create_flatpak_remotes`, `edit_flatpak_remotes`, and `destroy_flatpak_remotes`. 

* Set up Flatpak. 
For more information, see {RHELDocsBaseURL}9/html/administering_the_system_using_the_gnome_desktop_environment/assembly_installing-applications-using-flatpak_administering-the-system-using-the-gnome-desktop-environment#setting-up-flatpak_assembly_installing-applications-using-flatpak[Setting up Flatpak].

* Flatpak applications rely on Flatpak runtimes. 
For example, `rhel9/firefox-flatpak` depends on `rhel9/flatpak-runtime`. 
* Ensure that runtime repositories are available to clients alongside application repositories for installations to work.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Content* > *Flatpak Remotes*.
. Click *Create new*.
. In the *Name* field, enter a name for the Flatpak remote.
. In the *URL* field, enter the URL of the Flatpak remote.
  For example, to use the Red{nbsp}Hat Flatpak index, enter: `https://flatpaks.redhat.io/rhel/`.
. If the Flatpak remote requires authentication, enter the required credentials.
For example, synchronizing Red{nbsp}Hat Flatpaks from `registry.redhat.io` requires authentication. 
For more information, see https://access.redhat.com/articles/RegistryAuthentication#creating-registry-service-accounts-6[Creating Registry Service Accounts].

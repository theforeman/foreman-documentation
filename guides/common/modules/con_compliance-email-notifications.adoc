= Compliance email notifications

[role="_abstract"]
You can configure email notifications on your {ProjectServer} to stay informed about compliance policy changes.

{ProjectServer} sends an OpenSCAP Summary email to all users who subscribe to the *Compliance policy summary* email notifications.
For more information on subscribing to email notifications, see {AdministeringDocURL}Configuring_Email_Notification_Preferences_admin[Configuring Email Notification Preferences] in _{AdministeringDocTitle}_.

Each time a policy is run, {Project} checks the results against the previous run, noting any changes between them.
The email is sent according to the frequency requested by each subscriber, providing a summary of each policy and its most recent result.

= Adding {CRname} Images to {ProjectServer}

To create hosts using image-based provisioning, you must add information about the image, such as access details and the image location, to your {ProjectServer}.

ifeval::["{context}" == "kvm-provisioning"]
.Supported Storage Types
Note that you can manage only directory pool storage types through {ProjectX}.

.Procedure

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Infrastructure* > *Compute Resources* and click the name of your {CRname} connection.
. Click *Create Image*.
. In the *Name* field, enter a name for the image.
. From the *Operating System* list, select the image's base operating system.
. From the *Architecture* list, select the operating system architecture.
. In the *Username* field, enter the SSH user name for image access. This is normally the `root` user.
. In the *Password* field, enter the SSH password for image access.

ifeval::["{context}" == "kvm-provisioning"]
. In the *Image path* field, enter the full path that points to the image on the KVM server. For example:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
 /var/lib/libvirt/images/TestImage.qcow2
----
endif::[]

. Optional: Select the *User Data* check box if the image supports user data input, such as `cloud-init` data.
. Click *Submit* to save the image details.

.For CLI Users

* Create the image with the `hammer compute-resource image create` command.
ifeval::["{context}" == "kvm-provisioning"]
Use the `--uuid` field to store the full path of the image location on the KVM server.

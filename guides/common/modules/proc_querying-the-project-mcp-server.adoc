[id="querying-the-{project-context}-mcp-server"]
= Querying the {Project} MCP server

Users submit queries in natural language in an AI application, and the application retrieves and processes the relevant data from the {Project} inventory.

[WARNING]
====
Always review content generate by AI before using it in production.
====

[NOTE]
====
While {Team} provides examples of prompts and responses, some LLMs might process these queries differently.
Results in your environments might vary depending on the capabilities of the LLM your MCP client supports.
====

.Prerequisites
* You have configured the {Project} MCP server.
* Your MCP client is connected to the {Project} MCP server.
* You have registered multiple hosts.

.Procedure
* Type a query into your AI application.
For example:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
Show a list of hosts that require patching.
----
+
The AI application interprets the query and asks the MCP client to retrieve the relevant data from {Project} inventory through the MCP server.
The MCP client fetches the data and returns it to the AI application, which then processes it to provide an answer to the user.

[id="Extra_SCAP_Content_{context}"]
= Extra SCAP Content

You can upload extra SCAP content into {ProjectServer}, either content created by yourself or obtained elsewhere.
SCAP content must be imported into {ProjectServer} before being applied in a policy.

For example, the `scap-security-guide` RPM package available in the {EL} repositories includes a profile for the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) version 3.
You can upload this content into a {ProjectServer} even if it is not running {EL} as the content is not specific to an operating system version.

= Content promotion across the application lifecycle

[role="_abstract"]
In the application lifecycle chain, when content moves from one environment to the next, this is called _promotion_.

.Example: Content promotion across {Project} lifecycle environments

Each environment contains a set of systems registered to {ProjectName}.
These systems only have access to repositories relevant to their environment.
When you promote packages from one environment to the next, the target environment's repositories receive new package versions.
As a result, each system in the target environment can update to the new package versions.

ifndef::satellite[]
This example uses a `.{client-pkg-ext}` package, but you can promote any type of content across the application lifecycle.

|===
| Development | Testing | Production

| _example_software_-1.1-0.{client-pkg-arch}.{client-pkg-ext} | _example_software_-1.0-0.{client-pkg-arch}.{client-pkg-ext} | _example_software_-1.0-0.{client-pkg-arch}.{client-pkg-ext}
|===

After completing development on the patch, you promote the package to the Testing environment so the Quality Engineering team can review the patch.
The application lifecycle then contains the following package versions in each environment:

|===
| Development | Testing | Production

| _example_software_-1.1-0.{client-pkg-arch}.{client-pkg-ext} | *_example_software_-1.1-0.{client-pkg-arch}.{client-pkg-ext}* | _example_software_-1.0-0.{client-pkg-arch}.{client-pkg-ext}
|===

While the Quality Engineering team reviews the patch, the Development team starts work on _example_software_ 2.0.
This results in the following application lifecycle:

|===
| Development | Testing | Production

| *_example_software_-2.0-0.{client-pkg-arch}.{client-pkg-ext}* | _example_software_-1.1-0.{client-pkg-arch}.{client-pkg-ext} | _example_software_-1.0-0.{client-pkg-arch}.{client-pkg-ext}
|===

The Quality Engineering team completes their review of the patch.
Now _example_software_ 1.1 is ready to release.
You promote 1.1 to the _Production_ environment:

|===
| Development | Testing | Production

| _example_software_-2.0-0.{client-pkg-arch}.{client-pkg-ext} | _example_software_-1.1-0.{client-pkg-arch}.{client-pkg-ext} | *_example_software_-1.1-0.{client-pkg-arch}.{client-pkg-ext}*
|===

The Development team completes their work on _example_software_ 2.0 and promotes it to the Testing environment:

|===
| Development | Testing | Production

| _example_software_-2.0-0.{client-pkg-arch}.{client-pkg-ext} | *_example_software_-2.0-0.{client-pkg-arch}.{client-pkg-ext}* | _example_software_-1.1-0.{client-pkg-arch}.{client-pkg-ext}
|===

Finally, the Quality Engineering team reviews the package.
After a successful review, promote the package to the _Production_ environment:

|===
| Development | Testing | Production

| _example_software_-2.0-0.{client-pkg-arch}.{client-pkg-ext} | _example_software_-2.0-0.{client-pkg-arch}.{client-pkg-ext} | *_example_software_-2.0-0.{client-pkg-arch}.{client-pkg-ext}*

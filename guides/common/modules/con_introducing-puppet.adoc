= Introducing Puppet

Puppet is a configuration management tool using a declarative language to describe the state of managed hosts.

Puppet increases your productivity as you can administer multiple hosts simultaneously.
At the same time, it decreases your configuration effort as Puppet makes it easy to verify and possibly correct the state of the hosts.

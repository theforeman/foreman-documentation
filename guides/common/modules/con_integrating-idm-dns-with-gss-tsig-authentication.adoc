= Integrating {FreeIPA} DNS with GSS-TSIG authentication

[role="_abstract"]
If you use {FreeIPA} to centrally manage hosts in your domain, you can integrate the {FreeIPA} DNS service into {ProjectServer}.
The integration enables you to continue using your existing {FreeIPA} DNS service, and {Project} manages DNS records for hosts during their life cycle.

If {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer} is a member of a {FreeIPA} domain, use generic security service transaction signature (GSS-TSIG) authentication.
This method provides an increased security and a low key management effort compared to TSIG authentication.

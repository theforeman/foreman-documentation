= Exporting a Content View Version in a Syncable Format

You can export a version of a Content View to a syncable format that you can use to create your custom CDN.
After you have exported the Content View, you can do either of the following:

* Synchronize the content from your custom CDN over HTTP/HTTPS.
* Import the content using `hammer content-import`.
Note that this requires both the Export and Import servers to run {Project} {ProductVersion}.

.Prerequisites
* Ensure that you set the download policy to *Immediate* for all repositories within the Content View you export.
For more information, see xref:Download_Policies_Overview_{context}[].
* Ensure that you synchronize products you export to the required date.
* Ensure that the user exporting the content has the `Content Exporter` role.

.To Export a Content View Version
* List versions of the Content View that are available for export:
+
[subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer content-view version list \
--content-view="_My_Content_View_" \
--organization="_My_Organization_"
----

.Procedure
. Get the version number of desired version.
The following example targets version `1.0` for export:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer content-export complete version \
--content-view="_Content_View_Name_" \
--version=1.0 \
--organization="_My_Organization_" \
--format=syncable
----
. Optional: Verify that the exported content is located in the export directory:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# ls -lh /var/lib/pulp/exports/_My_Organization_/_My_Content_View_Name_/1.0/2021-02-25T18-59-26-00-00/

= Registering clients to the load balancer

[role="_abstract"]
To balance the load of network traffic from clients, you must register the clients to the load balancer.

To consume container content from a load balancer regardless of client registration, use the load balancer hostname with the container client of choice.
For example, use `podman login {loadbalancer-example-com}` to log in.

= Applying Remote SCAP Resources in a Disconnected Environment

SCAP data streams can contain remote resources, such as OVAL files, that the SCAP client can fetch over the internet when it runs on hosts.
If your host does not have internet access, you must download remote SCAP resources and distribute them to your host as local files.

.Prerequisites
* You have registered your host with remote execution enabled.
* Fetching remote resources must be disabled, which is the default.
For more information, see xref:inclusion-of-remote-scap-resources_{context}[].

.Procedure
. On your {ProjectServer}, examine the data stream you use in your compliance policy to find out which missing resource you must download:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]

# oscap info _/usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-rhel8-ds.xml_ | grep "WARNING"
WARNING: Datastream component 'scap_org.open-scap_cref_security-data-oval-com.redhat.rhsa-RHEL8.xml.bz2'
points out to the remote 'https://access.redhat.com/security/data/oval/com.redhat.rhsa-RHEL8.xml.bz2'.
Use '--fetch-remote-resources' option to download it.
WARNING: Skipping 'https://access.redhat.com/security/data/oval/com.redhat.rhsa-RHEL8.xml.bz2' file
which is referenced from datastream
----
. Examine the name of the local file that is referenced by the data stream:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# oscap info _/usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-rhel8-ds.xml_

			ssg-rhel8-oval.xml

			*security-data-oval-com.redhat.rhsa-RHEL8.xml.bz2*
				system: http://oval.mitre.org/XMLSchema/oval-definitions-5
...
----
. On an online machine, download the missing resource:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# curl -o _security-data-oval-com.redhat.rhsa-RHEL8.xml.bz2_ _https://www.redhat.com/security/data/oval/com.redhat.rhsa-RHEL8.xml.bz2_
----
+
IMPORTANT: Ensure that the name of the downloaded file matches the name the data stream references.
. Add the file as new {customfiletype} content into your disconnected {ProjectServer}.
For more information, see {ContentManagementDocURL}Managing_Custom_File_Type_Content_content-management[Managing {customfiletypetitle} Content] in _{ContentManagementDocTitle}_.
+
Note the URL on which your repository is published, such as `http://_{foreman-example-com}_/pulp/content/_My_Organization_Label_/Library/custom/_My_Product_Label_/_My_Repo_Label_/`.
. Schedule a remote job to upload the file to the home directory of `root` on your host.
For example, use the `Run Command - Script Default` job template and enter the following command:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# curl -o /root/_security-data-oval-com.redhat.rhsa-RHEL8.xml.bz2_ http://_{foreman-example-com}_/pulp/content/_My_Organization_Label_/Library/custom/_My_Product_Label_/_My_Repo_Label_/_security-data-oval-com.redhat.rhsa-RHEL8.xml.bz2_

. Continue with deploying your compliance policy.

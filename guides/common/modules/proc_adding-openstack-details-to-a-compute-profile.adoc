= Adding {OpenStack} details to a compute profile

Use this procedure to add {OpenStack} hardware settings to a compute profile.
When you create a host on {OpenStack} using this compute profile, these settings are automatically populated.

.Procedure

. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Infrastructure* > *Compute Profiles*.
. In the Compute Profiles window, click the name of an existing compute profile, or click *Create Compute Profile*, enter a *Name*, and click *Submit*.
. Click the name of the {OpenStack} compute resource.
. From the *Flavor* list, select the hardware profile on {OpenStack} to use for the host.
. From the *Availability zone* list, select the target cluster to use within the {OpenStack} environment.
. From the *Image* list, select the image to use for image-based provisioning.
. From the *Tenant* list, select the tenant or project for the {OpenStack} instance.
. From the *Security Group* list, select the cloud-based access rules for ports and IP addresses.
. From the *Internal network*, select the private networks for the host to join.
. From the *Floating IP network*, select the external networks for the host to join and assign a floating IP address.
. From the *Boot from volume*, select whether a volume is created from the image.
If not selected, the instance boots the image directly.
. In the *New boot volume size (GB)* field, enter the size, in GB, of the new boot volume.
. Click *Submit* to save the compute profile.

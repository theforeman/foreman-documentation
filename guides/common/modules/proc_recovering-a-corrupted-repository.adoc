= Recovering a Corrupted Repository

In case of repository corruption, you can recover it by using an advanced synchronization, which has three options:

Optimized Sync::
Synchronizes the repository bypassing RPMs that have no detected differences from the upstream RPMs.

Complete Sync::
Synchronizes all RPMs regardless of detected changes.
Use this option if specific RPMs could not be downloaded to the local repository even though they exist in the upstream repository.

Verify Content Checksum::
Synchronizes all RPMs and then verifies the checksum of all RPMs locally.
If the checksum of an RPM differs from the upstream, it re-downloads the RPM.
This option is relevant only for `yum` repositories.
Use this option if you have one of the following errors:

* Specific RPMs cause a `404` error while synchronizing with `yum`.
* `Package does not match intended download` error, which means that specific RPMs are corrupted.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Content*{nbsp}>{nbsp}*Products*.
. Select the product containing the corrupted repository.
. Select the name of a repository you want to synchronize.
. To perform optimized sync or complete sync, select *Advanced Sync* from the *Select Action* menu.
. Select the required option and click *Sync*.
. Optional: To verify the checksum, click *Verify Content Checksum* from the *Select Action* menu.

.CLI procedure
. Obtain a list of repository IDs:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer repository list \
--organization "_My_Organization_"
----
. Synchronize a corrupted repository using the necessary option:
+
* For the optimized synchronization:
+
[subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer repository synchronize \
--id _My_ID_
----
+
* For the complete synchronization:
+
[subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer repository synchronize \
--id _My_ID_ \
--skip-metadata-check true
----
+
* For the validate content synchronization:
+
[subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer repository synchronize \
--id _My_ID_ \
--validate-contents true
----

= Recovering a corrupted repository

In case of repository corruption, you can recover it by using an advanced synchronization, which has three options:

Optimized Sync::
Synchronizes the repository bypassing packages that have no detected differences from the upstream packages.

Complete Sync::
Synchronizes all packages regardless of detected changes.
Use this option if specific packages could not be downloaded to the local repository even though they exist in the upstream repository.

ifdef::client-content-dnf[]
Verify Content Checksum::
Synchronizes all packages and then verifies the checksum of all packages locally.
If the checksum of an RPM differs from the upstream, it re-downloads the RPM.
This option is relevant only for Yum content.
Use this option if you have one of the following errors:

* Specific packages cause a `404` error while synchronizing with `yum`.
* `Package does not match intended download` error, which means that specific packages are corrupted.
endif::[]

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Content* > *Products*.
. Select the product containing the corrupted repository.
. Select the name of a repository you want to synchronize.
. To perform optimized sync or complete sync, select *Advanced Sync* from the *Select Action* menu.
. Select the required option and click *Sync*.
. Optional: To verify the checksum, click *Verify Content Checksum* from the *Select Action* menu.

.CLI procedure
. Obtain a list of repository IDs:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
$ hammer repository list \
--organization "_My_Organization_"
----
. Synchronize a corrupted repository using the necessary option:
+
* For the optimized synchronization:
+
[subs="+quotes"]
----
$ hammer repository synchronize \
--id _My_ID_
----
+
* For the complete synchronization:
+
[subs="+quotes"]
----
$ hammer repository synchronize \
--id _My_ID_ \
--skip-metadata-check true
----
+
* For the validate content synchronization:
+
[subs="+quotes"]
----
$ hammer repository synchronize \
--id _My_ID_ \
--validate-contents true
----

= How to Configure Inter-Server Synchronization

{ProjectName} uses Inter-Server Synchronization (ISS) to synchronize content between two {ProjectServer}s in a multi-server {Project} setup.

You can use ISS in cases such as:

* If you want to copy some but not all content from your {ProjectServer} to other {ProjectServer}s.
For example, you have Content Views that your IT department consumes from {ProjectServer}, and you want to copy content from those Content Views to other {ProjectServer}s.
* If you want to copy all Library content from your {ProjectServer} to other {ProjectServer}s.
For example, you have Products and repositories that your IT department consumes from {ProjectServer} in the Library, and you want to copy all Products and repositories in that organization to other {ProjectServer}s.

[NOTE]
====
You cannot use ISS to synchronize content from {ProjectServer} to {SmartProxyServer}.
{SmartProxyServer} supports synchronization natively.
For more information, see {PlanningDocURL}chap-Documentation-Architecture_Guide-Capsule_Server_Overview[{SmartProxyServer} Overview] in _{PlanningDocTitle}_.

There are different ways of using ISS.
The way you can use depends on your multi-server setup that can fall to one of the following scenarios.

== ISS Network Sync in a Disconnected Scenario
In a disconnected scenario, there is the following setup:

* The upstream {ProjectServer} is connected to the Internet.
This server consumes content from the Red Hat Content Delivery Network (CDN) or custom sources.
* The downstream {ProjectServer} is completely isolated from all external networks.
* The downstream {ProjectServer} can communicate with a connected upstream {ProjectServer} over an internal network.

You can configure your downstream {ProjectServer} to synchronize content from the upstream {ProjectServer} over the network.
See xref:configuring-server-to-synchronize-content-over-a-network_{context}[].

== ISS Export Sync in an Air-Gapped Scenario
In an air-gapped scenario, there is the following setup:

* The upstream {ProjectServer} is connected to the Internet.
This server consumes content from the Red Hat CDN or custom sources.
* The downstream {ProjectServer} is completely isolated from all external networks.
* The downstream {ProjectServer} does not have a network connection to a connected upstream {ProjectServer}.

endif::[]

The only way for an air-gapped downstream {ProjectServer} to receive content updates is by exporting payload from the upstream {ProjectServer}, bringing it physically to the downstream {ProjectServer}, and importing the payload.
For more information, see {ContentManagementDocURL}Synchronizing_Content_Between_Servers_content-management[Synchronizing Content Between {ProjectServer}s] in _{ContentManagementDocTitle}_.

Configure your downstream {ProjectServer} to synchronize content using exports.
See xref:configuring-server-to-sync-content-using-exports_{context}[].

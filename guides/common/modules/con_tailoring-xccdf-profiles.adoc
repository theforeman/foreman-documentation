= Tailoring XCCDF Profiles

You can customize existing XCCDF profiles using _tailoring files_ without editing the original SCAP content.
A single tailoring file can contain customizations of multiple XCCDF profiles.

You can create a tailoring file using the https://www.open-scap.org/tools/scap-workbench/[SCAP Workbench] tool.
For more information on using the SCAP Workbench tool, see https://www.open-scap.org/resources/documentation/customizing-scap-security-guide-for-your-use-case/[Customizing SCAP Security Guide for your use case].

Then you can assign a tailoring file to a compliance policy to customize an XCCDF profile in the policy.

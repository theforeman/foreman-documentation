To send email messages from {ProjectServer}, you can use an SMTP server or the `sendmail` command.

:FeatureName: the pass:[\`sendmail\`] command
include::snip_deprecated-feature.adoc[]

.Prerequisites
* Some SMTP servers with anti-spam protection or greylisting features are known to cause problems.
To set up outgoing email with such a service, install and configure an SMTP service on {ProjectServer} for relay or use the `sendmail` command.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Administer* > *Settings*.
. Click the *Email* tab and set the configuration options to match your preferred delivery method.
The changes have an immediate effect.

.Using sendmail as a delivery method
[cols="1,1,2",options="header"]
|====
|Name| Example value| Additional information
|Delivery method | Sendmail |
|Sendmail location | /usr/sbin/sendmail .2+| For security reasons, both Sendmail location and Sendmail argument settings are read-only and can be only set in `/etc/foreman/settings.yaml`.
Both settings currently cannot be set via `{foreman-installer}`.

This is being tracked in https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/33543[issue #33543].

. To send email by using an SMTP server that uses TLS authentication, also perform one of the following steps:
+
* Mark the CA certificate of the SMTP server as trusted.
To do so, execute the following commands on {ProjectServer}:
+
[options="nowrap"]
----
# cp mailca.crt /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/
# update-ca-trust extract
----
+
Where `_mailca.crt_` is the CA certificate of the SMTP server.
+
* Alternatively, in the {ProjectWebUI}, set the `SMTP enable StartTLS auto` option to `No`.

. Click *Test email* to send a test message to the user's email address to confirm the configuration is working.
If a message fails to send, the {ProjectWebUI} displays an error.
See the log at `/var/log/foreman/production.log` for further details.

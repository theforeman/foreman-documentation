= Hardware and operating system configuration

[role="_abstract"]
You can tune the hardware and operating system to optimize {Project} performance for your scenario.

CPU::
The more physical cores that are available to {Project}, the higher throughput can be achieved for the tasks.
Some of the {Project} components such as Puppet and PostgreSQL are CPU intensive applications and can really benefit from the higher number of available CPU cores.

Memory::
The higher amount of memory available in the system running {Project}, the better will be the response times for the {Project} operations.
Since {Project} uses PostgreSQL as the database solutions, any additional memory coupled with the tunings will provide a boost to the response times of the applications due to increased data retention in the memory.

Disk::
{Project} should be deployed using SSDs to avoid performance bottlenecks.
Components such as PostgreSQL benefit from using SSDs due to their lower latency compared to HDDs.

Network::
The communication between the {ProjectServer} and {SmartProxies} is impacted by the network performance.
A decent network with a minimum jitter and low latency is required to enable hassle free operations such as {ProjectServer} and {SmartProxies} synchronization (at least ensure it is not causing connection resets, etc).

Server Power Management::
Your server by default is likely to be configured to conserve power.
While this is a good approach to keep the max power consumption in check, it also has a side effect of lowering the performance that {Project} may be able to achieve.
For a server running {Project}, it is recommended to set the BIOS to enable the system to be run in performance mode to boost the maximum performance levels that {Project} can achieve.

The runtime size was measured with {EL} 7, 8, and 9 repositories synchronized.

* If you mount the `/tmp` directory as a separate file system, use the `exec` mount option in the `/etc/fstab` file.
+
If `/tmp` is already mounted with the `noexec` option, change the option to `exec` and remount the file system.
This is a requirement for the `puppetserver` service to work.
* If you mount the `/var/lib/pulp` directory as an NFS share, specify the SELinux context of the `/var/lib/pulp` directory in the file system table.
Add the following lines to `/etc/fstab`:
+
----
nfs.example.com:/nfsshare  /var/lib/pulp  nfs  context="system_u:object_r:var_lib_t:s0"  1 2
----
+
If the NFS share is already mounted, remount it using the above configuration and restore the SELinux context:
+
----
# restorecon -R /var/lib/pulp
----
+
* Do not use symbolic links for `/var/lib/pulp/`.

* If you intend to synchronize RHEL content ISOs to {Project}, note that all minor versions of {RHEL} also synchronize.
Ensure adequate storage on your {Project} to manage this.

For external database servers: `{postgresql-lib-dir}` with installation size of 100 MB and runtime size of 20 GB.

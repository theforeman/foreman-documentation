[id="Performing_an_Incremental_Backup_{context}"]
= Performing an incremental backup

Use this procedure to perform an offline backup of any changes since a previous backup.

To perform incremental backups, you must perform a full backup as a reference to create the first incremental backup of a sequence.
Keep the most recent full backup and a complete sequence of incremental backups to restore from.

[WARNING]
====
Request other users of {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer} to save any changes and warn them that {Project} services are unavailable for the duration of the backup.
Ensure no other tasks are scheduled for the same time as the backup.
====

.Prerequisites
* Ensure that your backup location has sufficient available disk space to store the backup.

.Procedure
. To perform a full offline backup, enter the following command:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} backup offline _/var/backup_directory_
----
. To create a directory within your backup directory to store the first incremental back up, enter the `{foreman-maintain} backup` command with the `--incremental` option:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} backup offline --incremental _/var/backup_directory/full_backup_ _/var/backup_directory_
----
. To create the second incremental backup, enter the `{foreman-maintain} backup` command with the `--incremental` option and include the path to the first incremental backup to indicate the starting point for the next increment.
This creates a directory for the second incremental backup in your backup directory:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} backup offline --incremental _/var/backup_directory/first_incremental_backup_ _/var/backup_directory_
----
. Optional: If you want to point to a different version of the backup, and make a series of increments with that version of the backup as the starting point, you can do this at any time.
For example, if you want to make a new incremental backup from the full backup rather than the first or second incremental backup, point to the full backup directory:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} backup offline --incremental _/var/backup_directory/full_backup_ _/var/backup_directory_
----

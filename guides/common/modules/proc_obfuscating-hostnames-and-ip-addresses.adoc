= Obfuscating hostnames and IP addresses

[role="_abstract"]
You can configure {ProjectName} to obfuscate hostnames and IP addresses when uploading host data to {Insights}. 
Obfuscation ensures that sensitive identifying information is not exposed. 

When obfuscation settings are enabled, {Project} obfuscates hostnames and IP addresses. 
If obfuscation settings are enabled and the host has its own `insights-client` obfuscation settings, {Project} honors the host settings.  
If obfuscation settings are disabled, {Project} does not obfuscate hostnames or IP addresses unless the client has obfuscation enabled in `insights-client`.

By default, {Project} applies global obfuscation settings unless an `insights-client` on the host overrides the settings with its own configuration.

.Prerequisites
* Your hosts have `insights-client` installed and configured.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *{Insights}* > *Inventory Upload*.
. Enable the *Obfuscate host names* setting to obfuscate host names sent to the {RHCloud}.
. Enable the *Obfuscate host ipv4 addresses* setting to obfuscate IPv4 addresses sent to the {RHCloud}.

.Verification
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *{Insights}* > *Inventory Upload*.
. In the *Organization* dropdown menu, select the organization that uploaded the host data.
. Click *Download report* to download the host inventory report from {Insights}.
. Verify that the hostname is `randomhostname.example.com` and the IP address is obfuscated.

= Obfuscating hostnames and IP addresses

You can use {ProjectName} to obfuscate hostnames and IP addresses when uploading host data to {Insights}. 
Obfuscation ensures that sensitive identifying information is not exposed. 
When obfuscation settings are enabled, {Project} obfuscates hostnames and IP addresses. 
If obfuscation settings are enabled and the host has its own `insights-client` obfuscation settings, {Project} honors the host settings.  
If obfuscation settings are disabled, {Project} does not obfuscate hostnames or IP addresses, regardless of client settings.

By default, {Project} applies global obfuscation settings unless an `insights-client` on the host overrides the settings with its own configuration.
This procedure describes how {Project} applies obfuscation settings.

.Prerequisites
* Your hosts have `insights-client` installed and configured.

.Procedure
. Navigate to *{Insights}* > *Inventory Upload*.
. Enable the *Obfuscate host names* and *Obfuscate host ipv4 addresses* settings to obfuscate host names and ipv4 addresses sent to the {RHCloud}.

.Verifying obfuscation
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *{Insights}* > *Inventory Upload*.
. In the *Organization* dropdown menu, select the organization that uploaded the host data.
. Click *Download report* to download the host inventory report from {Insights}.
. Confirm that the hostname is `randomhostname.example.com` and the IP address is obfuscated.

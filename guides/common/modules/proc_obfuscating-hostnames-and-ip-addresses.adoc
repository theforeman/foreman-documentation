= Obfuscating hostnames and IP addresses

You can use {ProjectName} to obfuscate hostnames and IP addresses when uploading host data to Insights. 
Obfuscation ensures that sensitive identifying information is not exposed. 
When obfuscation settings are enabled, {Project} obfuscates hostnames and IP addresses. 
If obfuscation settings are enabled and the host has its own Insights client obfuscation settings, {Project} applies the client settings. 
If obfuscation settings are disabled, {Project} does not obfuscate hostnames or IP addresses, regardless of client settings.

By default, {Project} applies global obfuscation settings unless an Insights client on the host overrides the settings with its own configuration.
This procedure describes how {Project} applies obfuscation settings.

.Prerequisites
* Your hosts have Insights clients installed and configured.

.Procedure
. Navigate to *Insights* > *Inventory Upload*.
. Enable the *Obfuscate host names* and *Obfuscate host ipv4 addresses* settings to obfuscate host names and ipv4 addresses sent to the {RHCloud}.

.Verifying obfuscation
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Insights* > *Inventory Upload*.
. Select a recently uploaded host.
. Confirm that the hostname is `satellite.example.com` and the IP address is obfuscated.

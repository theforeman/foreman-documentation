= Overview of usage metrics collection in {Project}

{Project} includes the `satellite-maintain report generate` command, which can collect information from user environments to better understand how {Project} is used.

A `systemd` timer named `satellite-usage-metrics-generate.timer` runs weekly to collect the data.
The timer executes the `{foreman-maintain} report generate` command on your {ProjectServer} and then stores the collected data in the `/var/lib/foreman-maintain/satellite_metrics.yml` file.

When you use the `sos report` command to generate a report for Red{nbsp}Hat Technical Support, the `satellite_metrics.yml` file is included in the report along with the other configuration, diagnostics, and troubleshooting data that `sos` collects.

[NOTE]
====
The collected metrics are stored securely in `/var/lib/foreman-maintain/satellite_metrics.yml` and are only shared in sos reports.

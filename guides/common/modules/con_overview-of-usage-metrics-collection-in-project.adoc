= Overview of usage metrics collection in {Project}

{Project} includes the `satellite-maintain report generate` command, which can collect information from user environments to better understand how {Project} is used.

The following `systemd` timers collect the data:

`satellite-usage-metrics-generate.timer`::
This timer collects the full list of usage metrics.
It executes the `{foreman-maintain} report generate` command on your {ProjectServer} and then stores the collected data in the `/var/lib/foreman-maintain/satellite_metrics.yml` file.
The timer runs weekly.

`satellite-usage-metrics-condense.timer`::
This timer collects the same set of metrics as `satellite-usage-metrics-generate.timer`, condenses them so that they can be uploaded as custom Red{nbsp}Hat Subscription Manager facts, and stores them in the `/etc/rhsm/facts/foreman.facts` file.
The timer runs weekly.

When you use the `sos report` command to generate a report for Red{nbsp}Hat Technical Support, the report will include the `satellite_metrics.yml` and `/etc/rhsm/facts/foreman.facts` files, along with the other configuration, diagnostics, and troubleshooting data that `sos` collects.

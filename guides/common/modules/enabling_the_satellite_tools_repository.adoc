= Enabling the Satellite Tools Repository

The Satellite Tools repository provides the `katello-agent` and `puppet` packages for clients registered to Satellite Server. Installing the Katello agent is recommended to allow remote updates of clients. The base system of a Capsule Server is a client of Satellite Server and therefore must also have the Katello agent installed.

.Procedure
To enable the Satellite Tools repository, complete the following steps:

. In the Satellite web UI, navigate to *Content* > *Red Hat Repositories*.

. Use the Search field to enter the following repository name: *Red{nbsp}Hat Satellite Tools {ProductVersionRepoTitle} (for RHEL 7 Server) (RPMs)*.

. In the Available Repositories pane, click on *Red{nbsp}Hat Satellite Tools {ProductVersionRepoTitle} (for RHEL 7 Server) (RPMs)* to expand the repository set.

If the *Red{nbsp}Hat Satellite Tools {ProductVersionRepoTitle}* items are not visible, it may be because they are not included in the Subscription Manifest obtained from the Customer Portal.

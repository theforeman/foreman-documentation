= Provisioning methods

With {ProjectName}, you can provision hosts by using the following provisioning methods.

Network based::
You can use this method with hosts that provide PXE booting or UEFI HTTP booting.
+
You are required to configure the necessary network booting services, such as DHCP and TFTP servers.
When you create a host, you select a PXE loader that can configure DHCP options for network booting if {SmartProxy} is set up to configure the DHCP service automatically.
+
This method uses an operating system installer, such as Anaconda, Debian Installer, or YaST, and template-generated file with installation options automation from {Project}, such as Kickstart, Preseed, or AutoYaST.

Boot disk based::
You can use this method with PXE-less hosts or when you do not have the possibility to configure network booting services, such as DHCP.
+
This method supplies the booting capability but the rest of the provisioning process still uses an installer and template-generated file to automate the installation.

Image based::
You can use this method with virtual machines or cloud instances.
+
This method uses a virtual image template or a cloud image from a compute resource to provision the operating system.
{Project} can customize the image by running either a pre-boot or post-boot configuration script generated from a provisioning template.

= Importing an Ansible Playbook by name

[role="_abstract"]
You can import Ansible Playbooks by name to {Project} from collections installed on {SmartProxy}.

When you import an Ansible Playbook, {Project} creates a job template from the imported playbook and places the template in the `Ansible Playbook - Imported` job category.
If you have a custom collection, place it in `/etc/ansible/collections/ansible_collections/_My_Namespace_/_My_Collection_`.

.Prerequisites
* Ansible plugin is enabled.
* Your {Project} account has a role that grants the `import_ansible_playbooks` permission.

.Procedure
// Not available via Hammer/UI: https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/34318
. Fetch the available Ansible Playbooks by using the following API request:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
$ curl \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--request GET \
https://_{foreman-example-com}_/ansible/api/v2/ansible_playbooks/fetch?proxy_id=__My_{smart-proxy-context-titlecase}_ID__
----
. Select the Ansible Playbook you want to import and note its name.
. Import the Ansible Playbook by its name:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
$ curl \
--data '{ "playbook_names": ["_My_Playbook_Name_"] }' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--request PUT \
https://_{foreman-example-com}_/ansible/api/v2/ansible_playbooks/sync?proxy_id=__My_{smart-proxy-context-titlecase}_ID__
----
+
You get a notification in the {ProjectWebUI} after the import completes.

.Next steps
* You can run the playbook by executing a remote job from the created job template.

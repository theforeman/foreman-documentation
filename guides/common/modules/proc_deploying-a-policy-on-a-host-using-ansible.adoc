= Deploying a Policy on a Host Using Ansible

After you deploy a compliance policy on a host using Ansible, the Ansible role installs the SCAP client and configures OpenSCAP scans on the host according to the selected compliance policy.

The SCAP content in the compliance policy might require remote resources.

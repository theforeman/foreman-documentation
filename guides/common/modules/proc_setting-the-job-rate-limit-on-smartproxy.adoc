= Setting the Job Rate Limit on {SmartProxy}

You can limit the maximum number of active jobs on a {SmartProxy} at a time to prevent performance spikes.
The job is active from the time {SmartProxy} first tries to notify the host about the job until the job is finished on the host.

The job rate limit only applies to mqtt based jobs.

[NOTE]
====
The optimal maximum number of active jobs depends on the computing resources of your {SmartProxyServer}.
By default, the maximum number of active jobs is unlimited.
====

.Procedure
* Set the maximum number of active jobs using `{foreman-installer}`:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-installer} \
--foreman-proxy-plugin-remote-execution-script-mqtt-rate-limit _MAX_JOBS_NUMBER_
----
+
For example:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-installer} \
--foreman-proxy-plugin-remote-execution-script-mqtt-rate-limit 200

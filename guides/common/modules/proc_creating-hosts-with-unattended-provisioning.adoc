= Creating Hosts with Unattended Provisioning

Unattended provisioning is the simplest form of host provisioning.
You enter the host details on {ProjectServer} and boot your host.
{ProjectServer} automatically manages the PXE configuration, organizes networking services, and provides the operating system and configuration for the host.

This method of provisioning hosts uses minimal interaction during the process.

To use the CLI instead of the {ProjectWebUI}, see the xref:cli-creating-hosts-with-unattended-provisioning_{context}[].

. Click the *Operating System* tab, and verify that all fields contain values.
Confirm each aspect of the operating system.
. Optional: Click *Resolve* in *Provisioning template* to check the new host can identify the right provisioning templates to use.

For more information about associating provisioning templates, see xref:provisioning-templates_{context}[].

. Click the *Parameters* tab, and ensure that a parameter exists that provides an activation key.
If not, add an activation key.
endif::[]
. Click *Submit* to save the host details.

For more information about network interfaces, see {ManagingHostsDocURL}Adding_Network_Interfaces_managing-hosts[Adding network interfaces] in _{ManagingHostsDocTitle}_.

This creates the host entry and the relevant provisioning settings.
This also includes creating the necessary directories and files for PXE booting the bare metal host.
If you start the physical host and set its boot mode to PXE, the host detects the DHCP service of {ProjectServer}'s integrated {SmartProxy}, receives HTTP endpoint of the Kickstart tree and installs the operating system.

When the installation completes, the host also registers to {ProjectServer} using the activation key and installs the necessary configuration and management tools from the {project-client-name} repository.

. Create the host with the `hammer host create` command:

= Resolving Package Dependencies

In {Project}, you can use the package dependency resolution feature to ensure that any dependencies that packages have within a Content View are added to the dependent repository as part of the Content View publication process.

You can select to resolve package dependencies for any Content View that you want, or you can change the default setting to enable or disable resolving package dependencies for all new Content Views.

Note that resolving package dependencies can cause significant delays to Content View promotion.
The package dependency resolution feature does not consider packages that are installed on your system independently of the Content View or solve dependencies across repositories.

.Resolving Package Dependencies and Filters

Filters do not resolve any dependencies of the packages listed in the filters.
This might require some level of testing to determine what dependencies are required.

If you add a filter that excludes some packages that are required and the Content View has dependency resolution enabled, {Project} ignores the rules you create in your filter in favor of resolving the package dependency.

If you create a content filter for security purposes, to resolve a package dependency, {Project} can add packages that you might consider insecure.

.Procedure

To resolve package dependencies by default, complete the following steps:

. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Administer* > *Settings* and click the *Content* tab.
. Locate the *Content View Dependency Solving Default*, and select *Yes*.

You can also set the default level of dependency resolution that you want.
You can select between adding packages to solve dependencies only if the required package does not exist, or to add the latest packages to resolve the dependency even if the package exists in the repository.

To set the default level of dependency resolution, complete the following steps:

. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Administer* > *Settings* and click the *Content* tab.
. Locate the *Content View Dependency Solving Algorithm* and select one of the following options:
+
* To add the package that resolves the dependency only if it does not exist in the repository, select *Conservative*.
* To add the package that resolves the dependency regardless of whether or not it exists in the repository, select *Greedy*.

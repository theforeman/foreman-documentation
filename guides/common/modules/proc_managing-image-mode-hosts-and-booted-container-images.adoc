= Managing image mode hosts and booted container images

These actions streamline the management of image mode hosts, providing flexibility and control over host operations through {Project}.

.Procedure
. Navigate to *Content* > *Booted Container Images* to view all images used by image mode hosts.
This page displays the spread of digests under specific image paths.
More digests under an image path indicate greater drift in the host ecosystem, ideally minimized by ensuring all hosts run the most up-to-date image version.
. Click the host count to navigate to the *All Hosts Listing* page, which identifies the hosts associated with each specific image and displays the number of hosts using each digest.
. On a host's *Details* tab, use the image mode *Details* card to see the current `Bootc` status.
This card includes a link to the *`Bootc` Action - Script Default* remote execution job.
. Use the new remote execution jobs under the `Bootc` job category to manage image mode hosts:
* `Bootc Action` - Script Default: Select any `Bootc` action from the dropdown menu, enter arguments, and specify a target.
* `Bootc Rollback` - Script Default: Run `Bootc rollback` to revert to a previous image.
* `Bootc Status` - Script Default: Run `Bootc status` with optional extra parameters to check the status.
* `Bootc Switch` - Script Default: Run `Bootc switch` with a mandatory image input and optional extra parameters to switch to a different image.
* `Bootc Upgrade` - Script Default: Run `Bootc upgrade` with optional extra parameters to update the image.

[NOTE]
====
CLI users can alternatively run the `hammer host bootc images` command.

= Boot disk workflow

Using a boot disk to provision a host involves the following steps:

. Generate a boot disk ISO image.
. Write the image to an external storage device, for example by using the `dd` utility or `livecd-tools`.
. Configure your host to boot from the external storage device.
. Power on your host.
. The host boots from the ISO.
. The host connects to {ProjectServer} and starts installing the operating system.

If you cannot use network booting methods, you can provision hosts by using a boot disk.

Using a boot disk to provision a host involves the following steps:

. Create a host entry in {Project}.
. Generate a boot disk ISO image.
. Boot your host from the ISO image.
. The host connects to Templates {SmartProxy} and starts installing the operating system.

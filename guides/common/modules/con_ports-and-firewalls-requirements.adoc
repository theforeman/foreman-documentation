= Ports and Firewalls Requirements

For the components of Satellite architecture to communicate, ensure that the required network ports are open and free on the base operating system. You must also ensure that the required network ports are open on any network-based firewalls.

ifeval::["{context}" == "capsule"]
The installation of a Capsule Server fails if the ports between Satellite Server and Capsule Server are not open before installation starts.
endif::[]

Use this information to configure any network-based firewalls. Note that some cloud solutions must be specifically configured to allow communications between machines because they isolate machines similarly to network-based firewalls.
If you use an application-based firewall, ensure that the application-based firewall permits all applications that are listed in the tables and known to your firewall. If possible, disable the application checking and allow open port communication based on the protocol.

.Integrated Capsule
Satellite Server has an integrated Capsule and any host that is directly connected to Satellite Server is a Client of Satellite in the context of this section. This includes the base system on which Capsule Server is running.

.Clients of Capsule
Hosts which are clients of Capsules, other than Satellite's integrated Capsule, do not need access to Satellite Server. For more information on Satellite Topology, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_satellite/{ProductVersion}/html/planning_for_red_hat_satellite_6/chap-documentation-architecture_guide-capsule_server_overview#sect-Documentation-Architecture_Guide-Capsule_Networking[Capsule Networking] in _Planning for Red Hat Satellite 6_.

Required ports can change based on your configuration.

A matrix table of ports is available in the Red{nbsp}Hat Knowledgebase solution https://access.redhat.com/solutions/4527661[Red Hat Satellite 6.6 List of Network Ports].

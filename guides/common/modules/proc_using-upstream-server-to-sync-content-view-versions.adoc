= Using an Upstream {ProjectServer} to Sync Content View Versions

In this scenario, you use the upstream {ProjectServer} not only as a content store, but also to synchronize content for all infrastructure behind the isolated network.
You curate updates coming from the CDN into Content Views and Lifecycle Environments.
Once you promote content to a designated Lifecycle Environment, you can export the content from the upstream {ProjectServer} and import it into the downstream {ProjectServer}.

.On the upstream {ProjectServer}
. Ensure that repositories are using the *Immediate* download policy in one of the following ways:
.. For existing repositories using *On Demand*, change their download policy on the repository details page to *Immediate*.
.. For new repositories, ensure that the *Default Red Hat Repository download policy* setting is set to *Immediate* before enabling Red Hat repositories, and that the *Default download policy* is set to *Immediate* for custom repositories.

+
For more information, see xref:Download_Policies_Overview_{context}[].
. Enable the content that you want to synchronize.
For more information, see xref:Enabling_Red_Hat_Repositories_{context}[].
+
If you want to sync custom content, first xref:Creating_a_Custom_Product_{context}[create a custom Product] and xref:Synchronizing_Repositories_{context}[synchronize Product repositories].
. Synchronize the enabled content:
.. For the first export, perform a `complete` Version export on the Content View Version that you want to export.
For more information see, xref:Exporting_a_Content_View_Version_{context}[].
This generates content archives that you can import into one or more downstream {ProjectServer}s.
.. Export all future updates in the connected {ProjectServer}s incrementally.
This generates leaner content archives that contain changes only from the recent set of updates.
For example, if your Content View has a new repository, this exported content archive contains only the latest changes.
For more information, see xref:Exporting_Version_Incrementally_{context}[].
.. When you have new content, republish the Content Views that include this content before exporting the increment.
For more information, see xref:Managing_Content_Views_{context}[].
This creates a new Content View Version with the appropriate content to export.

.On the downstream {ProjectServer}
. Bring the content exported from the upstream {ProjectServer} over to the hard disk.
. Place it inside a directory under `/var/lib/pulp/imports`.
. Import the content to the organization that you want.
For more information, see xref:Importing_a_Content_View_Version_{context}[].
This will create a Content View Version from the exported content archives and then import content appropriately.

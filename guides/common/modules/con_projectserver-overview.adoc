{ProjectServer} is the central component of a {Project} deployment where you plan and manage the content lifecycle.

A typical {Project} deployment includes one {ProjectServer} on which you perform the following operations:

* Content lifecycle management
* Configuration of {SmartProxyServers}
* Configuration of hosts
* Host provisioning
* Patch management
* Subscription management

{ProjectServer} delegates content distribution, host provisioning, and communication to {SmartProxyServers}.
{ProjectServer} itself also includes a {SmartProxy}.

{ProjectServer} also contains a fine-grained authentication system.
You can grant {Project} users permissions to access precisely the parts of the infrastructure for which they are responsible.

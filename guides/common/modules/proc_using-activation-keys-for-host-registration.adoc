= Using Activation Keys for Host Registration

You can use activation keys to complete the following tasks:

* Registering new hosts during provisioning through {ProjectName}.
The kickstart provisioning templates in {ProjectName} contain commands to register the host using an activation key that is defined when creating a host.
* Registering existing {RHEL} hosts.
Configure Subscription Manager to use {ProjectServer} for registration and specify the activation key when running the `subscription-manager register` command.

.Multiple Activation Keys

You can use multiple activation keys when registering a content host.
You can then create activation keys for specific subscription sets and combine them according to content host requirements.
For example, the following command registers a content host to your organization with both VDC and OpenShift subscriptions:

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# subscription-manager register --org="_My_Organization_" \
--activationkey="ak-VDC,ak-OpenShift"
----

.Settings Conflicts
If there are conflicting settings in activation keys, the rightmost key takes precedence.

* Settings that conflict: *Service Level*, *Release Version*, *Environment*, *Content View*, and *Product Content*.
* Settings that do not conflict and the host gets the union of them: *Subscriptions* and *Host Collections*.
* Settings that influence the behavior of the key itself and not the host configuration: *Content Host Limit* and *Auto-Attach*.

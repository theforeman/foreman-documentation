= Using activation keys for host registration

You can use activation keys to complete the following tasks:

* Registering new hosts during provisioning through {ProjectName}.
The Kickstart provisioning templates in {ProjectName} contain commands to register the host using an activation key that is defined when creating a host.
* Registering existing {RHEL} hosts.

.Multiple activation keys
You can use multiple activation keys when registering a content host.
For example, you can use one activation key to enable specific repositories and another to assign a content view and lifecycle environment.

.Settings conflicts
If there are conflicting settings in activation keys, the rightmost key takes precedence.

* Settings that conflict: *Service Level*, *Release Version*, *Environment*, *Content View*, and *Product Content*.
* Settings that do not conflict and the host gets the union of them: *Host Collections*.
* Settings that influence the behavior of the key itself and not the host configuration: *Content Host Limit*.

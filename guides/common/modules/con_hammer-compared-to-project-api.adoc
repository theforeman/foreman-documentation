= Hammer compared to {Project} API

For many tasks, both Hammer and {Project} API are equally applicable.
Hammer can be used as a human friendly interface to {Project} API, for example to test responses to API calls before applying them in a script (use the `-d` option to inspect API calls issued by Hammer, for example `hammer -d organization list`).
Changes in the API are automatically reflected in Hammer, while scripts using the API directly have to be updated manually.

In the background, each Hammer command first establishes a binding to the API, then sends a request.
This can have performance implications when executing a large number of Hammer commands in sequence.
In contrast, a script communicating directly with the API establishes the binding only once.

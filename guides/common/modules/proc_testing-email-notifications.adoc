= Testing Email Notifications

To verify that users are correctly subscribed to notifications, trigger the notifications manually.

.Procedure
* To trigger the notifications, execute the following command:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# foreman-rake reports:_My_Frequency_
----
+
Replace _My_Frequency_ with one of the following:

* daily
* weekly
* monthly

This triggers all notifications scheduled for the specified frequency for all the subscribed users.
If every subscribed user receives the notifications, the verification succeeds.

[NOTE] 
====
Sending manually triggered notifications to individual users is currently not supported.

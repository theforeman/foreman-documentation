= Configuring Tracer on a host

You can install Tracer on hosts and access Traces on {Project}.
Tracer displays a list of outdated services and applications that need to be restarted, as well as asks you to restart the host after, for example, a kernel update.
Traces is the output generated by Tracer in the {ProjectWebUI}.

.Prerequisites
* The host is registered to {ProjectName}.
include::snip_prerequisite-project-client-repository-enabled.adoc[]
* Remote execution is enabled.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Hosts* > *All Hosts*.
. Select your host.
. On the *Traces* tab, click *Enable Traces*.
. Select the provider to install `katello-host-tools-tracer` from the list.
. Click *Enable Tracer*.
You get a REX job notification after the remote execution job is complete.
. If you get a list of applications that need to be restarted, select the ones that you want to restart.
. Click *Restart app*, then click one of these buttons:
* *Restart via remote execution*
* *Restart via customized remote execution*
+
The first option restarts the application immediately, while the second one allows you to examine and customize the REX job.

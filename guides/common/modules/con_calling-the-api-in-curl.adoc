= Calling the API in curl

[role="_abstract"]
You can use `curl` with the {Project} API to perform various tasks.

You can use `curl` to manipulate resources on your {ProjectServer}.
API calls to {Project} require data in `json` format.
For more information, see xref:passing-json-data-to-the-api-request[].

{ProjectName} requires the use of HTTPS, and by default, a certificate for host identification.
If you have not added the {ProjectServer} certificate as described in xref:ssl-authentication-overview[], then you can use the `--insecure` option to bypass certificate checks.

For user authentication, you can use the `--user` option to provide {Project} user credentials in the form `--user __My_User_Name__:__My_Password__`.
If you do not include the password, the command prompts you to enter it.
To reduce security risks, do not include the password as part of the command, because it then becomes part of your shell history.
For simplicity, the examples in this section include the password.

Be aware that if you use the `--silent` option, `curl` does not display a progress meter or any error messages.

Examples in this chapter use the Python `json.tool` module to format the output.

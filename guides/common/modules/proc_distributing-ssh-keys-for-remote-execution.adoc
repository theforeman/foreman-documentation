= Distributing SSH Keys for Remote Execution

For {SmartProxies} in `ssh` mode, remote execution connections are authenticated using SSH.
The public SSH key from {SmartProxy} must be distributed to its attached hosts that you want to manage.

Ensure that the SSH service is enabled and running on the hosts.
Configure any network or host-based firewalls to enable access to port 22.

Use one of the following methods to distribute the public SSH key from {SmartProxy} to target hosts:

. xref:distributing-ssh-keys-for-remote-execution-manually_{context}[].
. xref:Using_the_{project-context}_API_to_Obtain_SSH_Keys_for_Remote_Execution_{context}[].
. xref:Configuring_a_{client-provisioning-template-type}_Template_to_Distribute_SSH_Keys_During_Provisioning_{context}[].
. For new {Project} hosts, you can deploy SSH keys to {Project} hosts during registration using the global registration template.
For more information, see {ManagingHostsDocURL}Registering_Hosts_managing-hosts[Registering a Host to {ProjectName} Using the Global Registration Template] in _{ManagingHostsDocTitle}_.

{Project} distributes SSH keys for the remote execution feature to the hosts provisioned from {Project} by default.

If the hosts are running on Amazon Web Services, enable password authentication.

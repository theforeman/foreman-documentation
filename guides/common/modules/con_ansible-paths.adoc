[id="ansible-role-and-collection-paths-in-{project-context}"]
= Ansible role and collection paths in {Project}

{Project} imports and runs Ansible roles from the following paths:

* `/etc/ansible/roles`
* `/usr/share/ansible/roles`
* `/etc/ansible/collections`
* `/usr/share/ansible/collections`

Roles and collections from installed packages are placed under `/usr/share/ansible`.
If you want to add custom roles or collections, place them under `/etc/ansible`.

ifdef::satellite[]
Note that {Team} provides support only for Ansible roles and collections obtained from {Team}.
endif::[]

The paths are configured by {Project}.

= Discovery in PXE-less mode

{Project} provides a PXE-less Discovery service for environments without DHCP and TFTP services.
You discover unknown nodes by using the Discovery ISO from {ProjectServer}.
When a discovered node is scheduled for installation, the `kexec` command reloads a Linux kernel with an operating system installer without rebooting the node.

= Discovery in PXE-less mode

{Project} provides a PXE-less Discovery service that operates without the need for PXE-based services (DHCP and TFTP).
You accomplish this by using the Discovery ISO on {ProjectServer}.
Once a discovered node is scheduled for installation, it uses `kexec` command to reload Linux kernel with OS installer without rebooting the node.

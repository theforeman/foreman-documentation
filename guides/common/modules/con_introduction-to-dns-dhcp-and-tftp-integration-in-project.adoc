= Introduction to DNS, DHCP, and TFTP integration in {Project}

{Project} provides integrated DNS, DHCP, and TFTP services. For example, you can use them if you do not already have these services available in your network. However, a key feature of {Project} is the ability to seamlessly integrate with existing network services. By configuring the corresponding providers, you can use existing DNS, DHCP, and TFTP services and integrate them in to {Project}.

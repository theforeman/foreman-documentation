= Adding {ProjectServer} to {awx} as a Dynamic Inventory Item

To add {ProjectServer} to {awx} as a dynamic inventory item, you must create a credential for a {ProjectServer} user on {awx}, add an {awx} user to the credential, and then configure an inventory source.

.Prerequisites

* If your {Project} deployment is large, for example, managing tens of thousands of hosts, using a non-admin user can negatively impact performance because of time penalties that accrue during authorization checks. For large deployments, consider using an admin user.
* For non-admin users, you must assign the `{awx} Inventory Reader` role to your {ProjectServer} user. For more information about managing users, roles, and permission filters, see {BaseURL}administering_red_hat_satellite/chap-{Project_Link}-Administering_{Project_Link}-Users_and_Roles#sect-{Project_Link}-Administering_{Project_Link}-Users_and_Roles-Creating_and_Managing_Roles[Creating and Managing Roles] in _Administering {ProjectName}_.
* You must host your {ProjectServer} and {awx} on the same network or subnet.

.Procedure

To add {ProjectServer} to {awx} as a Dynamic Inventory Item, complete the following procedure:

. In the {awx} web UI, create a credential for your {Project}. For more information about creating credentials, see http://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/userguide/credentials.html#add-a-new-credential[Add a New Credential] and http://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/userguide/credentials.html#red-hat-satellite-6[{ProjectNameX} Credentials] in the _{awx} User Guide_.

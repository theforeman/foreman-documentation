= Monitoring hosts by using {Insights}

[role="_abstract"]
You can use {Insights} to diagnose systems and downtime related to security exploits, performance degradation, and stability failures.
You can use the {Insights} dashboard to quickly identify key risks to stability, security, and performance.
You can sort by category, view details of the impact and resolution, and then determine what systems are affected.

To use {Insights} to monitor hosts that you manage with {Project}, you must first install {Insights} on your hosts and register your hosts with {Insights}:

* For new {Project} hosts, you can install and configure {Insights} during host registration to {Project}.
For more information, see xref:Registering_Hosts_by_Using_Global_Registration_{context}[].
* For hosts already registered to {Project}, you can install and configure {Insights} on your hosts by using an Ansible role.
For more information, see xref:deploying-insights-by-using-the-ansible-role[].

* If you register your host to a new {ProjectServer}, reregister the host to {Insights} to avoid creating duplicate entries.

To view the logs for all plugins, go to `/var/log/foreman/production.log`.

If you have problems connecting to {Insights}, ensure that your certificates are up-to-date.
Refresh your subscription manifest to update your certificates.

You can change the default schedule for running `insights-client` by configuring `insights-client.timer` on a host.

= Managing Alternate Content Sources

Alternate content sources define alternate paths to download content during synchronization.
The content itself is downloaded from the alternate content source, while the metadata is downloaded from the {ProjectServer} or the upstream URL, depending on the configuration.
You can use alternate content source to speed up synchronization if the content is located on the local filesystem or on a nearby network.
You can set up alternate content sources for {ProjectServer} and {SmartProxy}.
You must refresh the alternate content source after creation or after making any changes.
A weekly cron job refreshes all alternate content sources.
You can also refresh the alternate content sources manually using the {ProjectWebUI} or the Hammer CLI.

There are three types of alternate content sources:

Custom::
Custom alternate content sources download the content from any upstream repository on the network or filesystem.

Simplified::
Simplified alternate content sources copy the upstream repository information from your {ProjectServer} for the selected products.
Simplified alternate content sources are ideal for situations where the connection from your {SmartProxy} to the upstream repo is faster than from your {ProjectServer}.
ifdef::satellite[]
Selecting the Red Hat products when creating a simplified alternate content source will download the content to the {SmartProxies} from the {Team} CDN.
endif::[]

RHUI::
RHUI alternate content sources download content from a Red Hat Update Infrastructure server.
{ProjectWebUI} provides examples to help you find the network paths and to import authentication credentials.
ifdef::satellite[]
The RHUI alternate content source must be RHUI version 4 or greater and use the default installation configuration.
For example, AWS RHUI is unsupported because it uses an installation scenario with unique authentication requirements.

.Permission Requirements for Alternate Content Sources

Non-administrator users must have the below permissions to manage alternate content sources:

. `view_smart_proxies`
. `view_content_credentials`
. `view_organizations`
. `view_products`

In addition to the above permissions, assign permissions specific to alternate content sources, depending on the actions the users can perform:

. `view_alternate_content_sources`
. `create_alternate_content_sources`
. `edit_alternate_content_sources`
. `destroy_alternate_content_sources`

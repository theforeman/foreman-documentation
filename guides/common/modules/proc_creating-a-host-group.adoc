= Creating a host group

Create a host group to be able to apply host settings to multiple hosts.

To use the CLI instead of the {ProjectWebUI}, see the xref:cli-creating-a-host-group_{context}[].

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Configure* > *Host Groups* and click *Create Host Group*.
. If you have an existing host group that you want to inherit attributes from, you can select a host group from the *Parent* list.
If you do not, leave this field blank.
. Enter a *Name* for the new host group.
. Enter any further information that you want future hosts to inherit.
. Click the *Ansible Roles* tab, and from the *Ansible Roles* list, select one or more roles that you want to add to the host.
Use the *arrow* icon to manage the roles that you add or remove.
. Click the additional tabs and add any details that you want to attribute to the host group.

[NOTE]
====
Puppet fails to retrieve the Puppet CA certificate while registering a host with a host group associated with a Puppet environment created inside a `Production` environment.

To create a suitable Puppet environment to be associated with a host group, manually create a directory:

[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# mkdir /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/_example_environment_
----
====
. Click *Submit* to save the host group.

= Applying errata to hosts

You can use the API to apply errata to a host, host group, or host collection.
The following is the basic syntax of a PUT request:

[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
$ curl --header "Accept:application/json" \
--header "Content-Type:application/json" --request PUT \
--user _My_User_Name_:__My_Password__ \
--data _My_JSON_Formatted_Data_ https://_{foreman-example-com}_
----

You can browse the built-in API doc to find a URL to use for applying errata.
You can use the {ProjectWebUI} to help discover the format for the search query.
Navigate to *Hosts* > *Host Collections* and select a host collection.
Go to *Collection Actions* > *Errata Installation* and notice the search query box contents.
For example, for a Host Collection called _my-collection_, the search box contains `host_collection="my-collection"`.

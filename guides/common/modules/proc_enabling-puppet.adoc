= Enabling Puppet Integration with {Project}

By default, {Project} does not have any Puppet integration configured.
You need to enable the integration as is appropriate for your situation.
This means that you can configure {Project} to manage and deploy Puppet server on {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServers}.
Additionally, you can deploy Puppet server to {Project} externally and integrate it with {Project} for reporting, facts, and external node classification (ENC).

= Adding KVM details to a compute profile by using {ProjectWebUI}

[role="_abstract"]
You can create standardized virtual machines more quickly and efficiently by adding KVM hardware settings to a compute profile.
When you create a host on KVM using this compute profile, these settings are automatically populated.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Infrastructure* > *Compute Profiles*.
. In the Compute Profiles window, click the name of an existing compute profile, or click *Create Compute Profile*, enter a *Name*, and click *Submit*.
. Click the name of the KVM compute resource.
. In the *CPUs* field, enter the number of CPUs to allocate to the new host.
. In the *Memory* field, enter the amount of memory to allocate to the new host.
. From the *Image* list, select the image to use if performing image-based provisioning.
. From the *Network Interfaces* list, select the network parameters for the host's network interface.
You can create multiple network interfaces.
However, at least one interface must point to a {SmartProxy}-managed network.
. In the *Storage* area, enter the storage parameters for the host.
You can create multiple volumes for the host.
. Click *Submit* to save the settings to the compute profile.

. Optional: in the *Description* field, enter a description for the location.
. Click *Submit*.
. If you have hosts with no location assigned, add any hosts that you want to assign to the new location, then click *Proceed to Edit*.

This includes networking resources, installation media, kickstart templates, and other parameters.

[id="Application_Definitions_{context}"]
= Application Definitions

Application definitions are blueprints of deployed applications.
They are required along with an xref:Ansible_Playbooks_{context}[] to create xref:Application_Instances_{context}[].

Application definitions consist of a list of services and Ansible group variables and serve as a preconfigured _blueprint_ providing easy self service for end users.
Each service has a name, host group, Ansible group, and minimum and maximum number of host running this service.

Users with administrative access to {ProjectName} handle application definitions and specify the allowed number of hosts for each service.

In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Applications > App Definitions* to add, edit, and remove application definitions for application centric deployment.

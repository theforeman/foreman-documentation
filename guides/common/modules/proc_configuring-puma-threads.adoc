More workers allow for lower time to register hosts in parallel.
For example, we have compared these two setups:

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|{Project} VM with 8 CPUs, 40 GiB RAM |{Project} VM with 8 CPUs, 40 GiB RAM
|`--foreman-foreman-service-puma-threads-min=16` |`--foreman-foreman-service-puma-threads-min=8`
|`--foreman-foreman-service-puma-threads-max=16` |`--foreman-foreman-service-puma-threads-max=8`
|`--foreman-foreman-service-puma-workers=2` |`--foreman-foreman-service-puma-workers=4`
|===

Using more workers and the same total number of threads results in about 11% of speedup in highly concurrent registrations scenario.
Moreover, adding more workers did not consume more CPU and RAM but gets more performance.

[id="Content-Views-in-{ProjectNameID}_{context}"]
= Content views in {ProjectName}

A content view is a deliberately curated subset of content that your hosts can access.
By creating a content view, you can define the software versions used by a particular environment or {SmartProxyServer}.

Each content view creates a set of repositories across each environment.
Your {ProjectServer} stores and manages these repositories.
For example, you can create content views in the following ways:

* A content view with older package versions for a production environment and another content view with newer package versions for a _Development_ environment.
* A content view with a package repository required by an operating system and another content view with a package repository required by an application.
* A composite content view for a modular approach to managing content views.
For example, you can use one content view for content for managing an operating system and another content view for content for managing an application.
By creating a composite content view that combines both content views, you create a new repository that merges the repositories from each of the content views.
However, the repositories for the content views still exist and you can keep managing them separately as well.

.Default Organization View
A _Default Organization View_ is an application-controlled content view for all content that is synchronized to {Project}.
With the Default Organization View, you can register a host to {Project} and access content without manipulating content views and lifecycle environments.

.Promoting a content view across environments
When you promote a content view from one environment to the next environment in the application lifecycle, {Project} updates the repository and publishes the packages.

.Promoting a package from _Development_ to _Testing_
====
The repositories for _Testing_ and _Production_ contain the `_<my_software>_-1.0-0.{client-pkg-arch}.{client-pkg-ext}` package:

|===
| | Development | Testing | Production

| Version of the content view | Version 2 | Version 1 | Version 1
| Contents of the content view | _<my_software>_-1.1-0.{client-pkg-arch}.{client-pkg-ext} | _<my_software>_-1.0-0.{client-pkg-arch}.{client-pkg-ext} | _<my_software>_.0-0.{client-pkg-arch}.{client-pkg-ext}
|===

If you promote Version 2 of the content view from _Development_ to _Testing_, the repository for _Testing_ updates to contain the `_<my_software>_-1.1-0.{client-pkg-arch}.{client-pkg-ext}` package:

|===
| | Development | Testing | Production

| Version of the content view | Version 2  | *Version 2* | Version 1
| Contents of the content view | _<my_software>_-1.1-0.{client-pkg-arch}.{client-pkg-ext} | *_<my_software>_-1.1-0.{client-pkg-arch}.{client-pkg-ext}* | _<my_software>_-1.0-0.{client-pkg-arch}.{client-pkg-ext}
|===

This ensures hosts are designated to a specific environment but receive updates when that environment uses a new version of the content view.

[role="_abstract"]
The following procedure describes how to view and filter the available errata in {ProjectWebUI} and how to display metadata of the selected advisory.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Content* > *Content Types* > *Errata* to view the list of available errata.
. Use the filtering tools at the top of the page to limit the number of displayed errata:
+
* Select the repository to be inspected from the list.
*All Repositories* is selected by default.
* The *Applicable* checkbox is selected by default to view only applicable errata in the selected repository.
Select the *Installable* checkbox to view only errata marked as installable.
* To search the table of errata, type the query in the *Search* field in the form of:
+
[subs="+quotes"]
----
__parameter operator value__

+
See xref:Parameters_Available_for_Errata_Search_{context}[] for the list of parameters available for search.
Find the list of applicable operators in {AdministeringDocURL}Supported_Operators_for_Granular_Search_admin[Supported Operators for Granular Search] in _{AdministeringDocTitle}_.
Automatic suggestion works as you type.
You can also combine queries with the use of *and* and *or* operators.

type = security and package_name = kernel
----
+
Press *Enter* to start the search.

* On the *Content Hosts* tab, you can apply the erratum to selected content hosts as described in xref:applying-errata-to-hosts[].
* The *Repositories* tab lists repositories that already contain the erratum.

You can also use the new Host page to view to inspect available errata and select errata to install.

. On the Content page select the *Errata* tab.
. The page displays installable errata for the chosen host.
. Click the checkbox for any errata you want to install.

{ProjectName} provides multiple download policies for synchronizing RPM content.

ifndef::satellite[]
{ProjectName} provides multiple download policies for synchronizing RPM and DEB content.
endif::[]
For example, you might want to download only the content metadata while deferring the actual content download for later.

{ProjectServer} has the following policies:

Immediate::
{ProjectServer} downloads all metadata and packages during synchronization.

On Demand::
{ProjectServer} downloads only the metadata during synchronization.
{ProjectServer} only fetches and stores packages on the file system when {SmartProxies} or directly connected clients request them.
This setting has no effect if you set a corresponding repository on a {SmartProxy} to *Immediate* because {ProjectServer} is forced to download all the packages.

The *On Demand* policy acts as a _Lazy Synchronization_ feature because they save time synchronizing content.
ifdef::satellite[]
The lazy synchronization feature must be used only for `yum` repositories.
endif::[]
ifndef::satellite[]
The lazy synchronization feature must be used only for `deb` and `yum` repositories.
endif::[]
You can add the packages to Content Views and promote to life cycle environments as normal.

Note that some repositories such as EPEL not only add packages to their upstream repository, but also remove older versions of packages.
You should enable *Mirror on Sync* and use download policy *immediate* for such repositories.

{SmartProxyServer} has the following policies:

Immediate::
{SmartProxyServer} downloads all metadata and packages during synchronization.
Do not use this setting if the corresponding repository on {ProjectServer} is set to *On Demand* as {ProjectServer} is forced to download all the packages.

On Demand::
{SmartProxyServer} only downloads the metadata during synchronization.
{SmartProxyServer} fetches and stores packages only on the file system when directly connected clients request them.
When you use an *On Demand* download policy, content is downloaded from {ProjectServer} if it is not available on {SmartProxyServer}.

Inherit::
{SmartProxyServer} inherits the download policy for the repository from the corresponding repository on {ProjectServer}.

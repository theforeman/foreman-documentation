ifdef::satellite[]
{ProjectName} provides multiple download policies for synchronizing RPM content.

ifndef::satellite[]
{ProjectName} provides multiple download policies for synchronizing Deb and Yum content and container images.
endif::[]
For example, you might want to download only the content metadata while deferring the actual content download for later.

{ProjectServer} has the following policies:

Immediate::
{ProjectServer} downloads all metadata and packages during synchronization.

On Demand::
{ProjectServer} downloads only the metadata during synchronization.
{ProjectServer} only fetches and stores packages on the file system when {SmartProxies} or directly connected clients request them.
This setting has no effect if you set a corresponding repository on a {SmartProxy} to *Immediate* because {ProjectServer} is forced to download all the packages.

The *On Demand* policy acts as a _Lazy Synchronization_ feature because they save time synchronizing content.
ifdef::satellite[]
The lazy synchronization feature must be used only for Yum repositories.
endif::[]
ifndef::satellite[]
The lazy synchronization feature must be used only for Deb and Yum repositories.
endif::[]
You can add the packages to content views and promote to lifecycle environments as normal.

{SmartProxyServer} has the following policies:

Immediate::
{SmartProxyServer} downloads all metadata and packages during synchronization.
Do not use this setting if the corresponding repository on {ProjectServer} is set to *On Demand* as {ProjectServer} is forced to download all the packages.

On Demand::
{SmartProxyServer} only downloads the metadata during synchronization.
{SmartProxyServer} fetches and stores packages only on the file system when directly connected clients request them.
When you use an *On Demand* download policy, content is downloaded from {ProjectServer} if it is not available on {SmartProxyServer}.

Inherit::
{SmartProxyServer} inherits the download policy for the repository from the corresponding repository on {ProjectServer}.

Streamed Download Policy::
Streamed Download Policy for {SmartProxies} permits {SmartProxies} to avoid caching any content.
When content is requested from the {SmartProxy}, it functions as a proxy and requests the content directly from the {Project}.

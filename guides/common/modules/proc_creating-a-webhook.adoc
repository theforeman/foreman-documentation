= Creating a Webhook

You can customize events, payloads, HTTP authentication, content type, and headers through the {ProjectWebUI}.

Use the following procedure to create a webhook in the {ProjectWebUI}.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, click *Administer* *>* *Webhooks*.
. Click *Create Webhook*.
. Click *Subscribe to* to select an event.
. Enter a name.
. Enter a target URL.
Webhooks make HTTP requests to pre-configured URLs.
The target URL can be a dynamic URL.
When using the shellhooks plugin, the URL should be in the form `\https://{smartproxy-example-com}:{smartproxy_port}/shellhook/my_script`.
. Click *Template* to select a template.
. Enter an HTTP method.
. Check the *Enabled* flag if you want to create an active webhook.
. Click the *Credentials* tab.
. Optional: If HTTP authentication is required, enter the username and password.
. Select *Verify SSL* if the server certificate should be verified against the system certificate store or {Project} CA.
. Select *Proxy Authorization* when using shellhooks, otherwise clear this box.
. On the *Additional* tab, enter the HTTP Content Type.
For example, `application/json`, `application/xml` or `text/plain` on the payload you define.
The application does not attempt to convert the content to match the specified content type.
. Optional: Provide HTTP headers as JSON.
ERB is also allowed.

When configuring webhooks with endpoints with non-standard HTTP or HTTPS ports, an SELinux port must be assigned, see {InstallingProjectDocURL}configuring-selinux-to-ensure-access-on-custom-ports_{context}[Configuring SELinux to Ensure Access to {Project} on Custom Ports] in _{project-installation-guide-title}_.

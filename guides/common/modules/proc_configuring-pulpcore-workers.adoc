= Configuring Pulpcore Workers

The pulpcore workers are the ones that fetch things from the content delivery network, process metadata etc. and the number of those will have an influence on the sync performance.

Decreasing the number does not give any benefit from the sync speed point of view.
Increasing the number gives a marginal benefit from the sync speed point of view, at the expense of almost doubling system load and increasing the PG load.
For example, we have compared these two setups:

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|{Project} VM with 8 CPUs, 32 GiB RAM, 4 pulpcore-api_workers |{Project} VM with 8 CPUs, 32 GiB RAM, 16 pulpcore-api_workers
|===

.Procedure
. Update the pulpcore worker_count on your {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer} :

<1> The `"job_invocation"` object, which contains the API request.
<2> Optional: Limit the number of hosts on which the job is run concurrently.

Separate multiple packages with a whitespace.
<5> Optional: Time boundaries for when to start to {PackageAction} packages.

* You can specify one or both boundaries in the ISO 8601 format.
* The action is canceled if it is not possible to {PackageAction} the packages by this time.
* If you omit time, it defaults to 00:00:00.
* If you omit time zone, it defaults to UTC.
--
<6> The search query that matches the hosts on which you want to {PackageAction} the packages.
<7> Optional: Credentials of an SSH user, if you want to {PackageAction} packages as that user.
<8> Optional: If you supplied the `"scheduling"` object, you can make the search query be evaluated when the job runs by specifying the `"targeting_type/dynamic_query"` field.

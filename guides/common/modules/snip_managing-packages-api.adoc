Create a body of the API request in the JSON format by following the instructions below.

.API Procedure
. Create the `"job_invocation"` object and place rest of the body inside this object.
. Create the `"inputs"` object with the `"package"` field of the string type specifying the packages you want to {PackageAction}.
If you are specifying multiple packages, separate them with a whitespace.
. Create a `"feature"` field of the string type with value `"katello_package_{PackageAction}"`.
. Create a `"search_query"` field of the string type and input a search query matching the hosts on which you want to {PackageAction} the packages.
. Optional: If you want to {PackageAction} packages as a specific user, create an `ssh` object with the following fields of the string type:
* `"effective_user"` with the name of the ssh user
* `"effective_user_password"` with the password of the ssh user if this password is required
. Optional: If you want to {PackageAction} packages at a later time, create the `"scheduling"` object.
The object can contain one or both of the following fields of the string type with date, time, and a timezone in the ISO 8601 format:
* `"start_at"`- sets the time to {PackageAction} the packages
* `"start_before"` - sets the latest time to {PackageAction} the packages.
If it is not possible to {PackageAction} the packages by this time, then this action is cancelled.

+
If you omit time, it defaults to 00:00:00.
If you omit timezone, it defaults to UTC.
. Optional: If you want to limit the number of hosts on which the job is run concurrently, create the `"concurrency_control"` object with the `"concurrency_level"` field of the integer type.
Assign the number of hosts as the field value.
. Optional: If you want to {PackageAction} packages at a later time and you want the host search query to be evaluated at a time of running the job, create a `"targeting_type"` field of the string type with the `"dynamic_query"` value.
This is useful if you expect the result of the search query to be different at the time of running the job due to changed status of the hosts.
If you omit this field, it defaults to `"static_query"`.

. Send a `POST` request with the created body to the `/api/job_invocations` endpoint of your {ProjectServer} and use a tool like python to see a formatted response.

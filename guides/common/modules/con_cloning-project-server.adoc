[id="cloning_{project-context}_server"]
= Cloning {ProjectServer}

You can clone your {ProjectServer} to create instances to test upgrades and migration of instances to a different machine or operating system.
This is an optional step to provide more flexibility during the upgrade or migration.

You cannot use the {Project} clone tool on a {SmartProxyServer}.
Instead, you must backup the existing {SmartProxyServer}, restore it on the target server, and then reconfigure {SmartProxyServer}.

Note that because of the high volume of data that you must copy and transfer as part of the cloning process, it can take a significant amount of time to complete.

[NOTE]
====
If you create a new instance of the {ProjectServer}, decommission the old instances after restoring the backup.
Cloned instances are not supposed to run in parallel in a production environment.
====

Review the following definitions before proceeding:

*Source server*:: The old server to be cloned.

*Target server*:: The new server that you copy files to and clone the source server to.

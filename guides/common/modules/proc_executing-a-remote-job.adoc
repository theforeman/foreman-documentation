= Executing a Remote Job

You can execute a job that is based on a job template against one or more hosts.

To use the CLI instead of the {ProjectWebUI}, see the xref:cli-executing-a-remote-job_{context}[].

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Monitor* > *Jobs* and click *Run job*.
+
[NOTE]
====
{Project} {ProjectVersion} features a new job wizard.
If you want to use job wizard from earlier {Project} versions, click *Use legacy form* in the top right corner of the job wizard.
Note that this guide only applies to the new job wizard.
====
. Select the *Job category* and the *Job template* you want to use, then click *Next*.
. Select hosts on which you want to run the job.
ifdef::satellite,orcharhino,katello[]
You can filter hosts by host names, host collections, host groups, and a search query.
endif::[]
ifndef::satellite,orcharhino,katello[]
You can filter hosts by host names, host groups, and a search query.
endif::[]
If you do not select any hosts, the job will run on all hosts you can see in the current context.
. If required, provide inputs for the job template.
Different templates have different inputs and some templates do not have any inputs.
After entering all the required inputs, click *Next*.
. Optional: To configure advanced settings for the job, fill in the *Advanced fields*.
To learn more about advanced settings, see xref:advanced-settings-in-the-job-wizard_{context}[].
When you are done entering the advanced settings or you do not need to enter any advanced settings, click *Next*.
. Schedule time for the job.
* To execute the job immediately, keep the pre-selected *Immediate execution*.
* To execute the job in future time, select *Future execution*.
* To execute the job on regular basis, select *Recurring execution*.
. Optional: If you selected future or recurring execution, select the *Query type*, otherwise click *Next*.
* *Static query* means that job executes on the exact list of hosts that you provided.
* *Dynamic query* means that the list of hosts is evaluated just before the job is executed.
If you entered the list of hosts based on some filter, the results can be different from when you first used that filter.

+
Click *Next* after you have selected the query type.
. Optional: If you selected future or recurring execution, provide additional details:
* For *Future execution*, enter the *Starts at* date and time.
You also have the option to select the *Starts before* date and time.
If the job cannot start before that time, it will be canceled.
* For *Recurring execution*, select the start date and time, frequency, and the condition for ending the recurring job.
You can choose the recurrence to never end, end at a certain time, or end after a given number of repetitions.
You can also add *Purpose* - a special label for tracking the job.
There can only be one active job with a given purpose at a time.

+
Click *Next* after you have entered the required information.
. Review job details.
You have the option to return to any part of the job wizard and edit the information.
. Click *Run* to schedule the job for execution.

= Executing a remote job

[role="_abstract"]
You can execute a job that is based on a job template against one or more hosts.

[NOTE]
====
Ansible jobs run in batches on multiple hosts, so you cannot cancel a job running on a specific host.
A job completes only after the Ansible Playbook runs on all hosts in the batch.
====

To use the CLI instead of the {ProjectWebUI}, see the xref:cli-executing-a-remote-job_{context}[].

ifdef::foreman-el,foreman-deb[]
.Prerequisites
* You have the Remote Execution plugin enabled.
For more information, see xref:installing-the-remote-execution-plugin[].
endif::[]

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Monitor* > *Jobs* and click *Run job*.
. Select the *Job category* and the *Job template* you want to use, then click *Next*.
. Select hosts on which you want to run the job.
If you do not select any hosts, the job will run on all hosts you can see in the current context.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you want to select a host group and all of its subgroups, it is not sufficient to select the host group as the job would only run on hosts directly in that group and not on hosts in subgroups.
Instead, you must either select the host group and all of its subgroups or use this search query:

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
hostgroup_fullname ~ "_My_Host_Group_*"
----

Replace _My_Host_Group_ with the name of the top-level host group.
====
. If required, provide inputs for the job template.
Different templates have different inputs and some templates do not have any inputs.
After entering all the required inputs, click *Next*.
. Optional: To configure advanced settings for the job, fill in the *Advanced fields*.
ifndef::orcharhino[]
To learn more about advanced settings, see xref:advanced-settings-in-the-job-wizard_{context}[].
endif::[]
. Click *Next*.
. Schedule time for the job.
* To execute the job immediately, keep the pre-selected *Immediate execution*.
* To execute the job in future time, select *Future execution*.
* To execute the job on regular basis, select *Recurring execution*.
. Optional: If you selected future or recurring execution, select the *Query type*, otherwise click *Next*.
* *Static query* means that job executes on the exact list of hosts that you provided.
* *Dynamic query* means that the list of hosts is evaluated just before the job is executed.
If you entered the list of hosts based on some filter, the results can be different from when you first used that filter.

+
Click *Next* after you have selected the query type.
. Optional: If you selected future or recurring execution, provide additional details:
* For *Future execution*, enter the *Starts at* date and time.
You also have the option to select the *Starts before* date and time.
If the job cannot start before that time, it will be canceled.
* For *Recurring execution*, select the start date and time, frequency, and the condition for ending the recurring job.
You can choose the recurrence to never end, end at a certain time, or end after a given number of repetitions.
You can also add *Purpose* - a special label for tracking the job.
There can only be one active job with a given purpose at a time.

+
Click *Next* after you have entered the required information.
. Review job details.
You have the option to return to any part of the job wizard and edit the information.
. Click *Submit* to schedule the job for execution.

[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
$ hammer settings set \
--name remote_execution_global_proxy \
--value false
----

----
$ hammer job-template list
----
. Show the template details to see parameters required by your template:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,attributes"]

$ hammer job-template info --id _My_Template_ID_
----
. Execute a remote job with custom parameters:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,attributes"]

--job-template "_My_Template_Name_" \
--search-query "_My_Search_Query_"
----

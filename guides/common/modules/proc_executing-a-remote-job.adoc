= Executing a Remote Job

You can execute a job that is based on a job template against one or more hosts.


.Procedure

. Navigate to *Hosts* > *All Hosts* and select the target hosts on which you want to execute a remote job. You can use the search field to filter the host list.
. From the *Select Action* list, select *Schedule Remote Job*.
. On the *Job invocation* page, define the main job settings:
. Select the *Job category* and the *Job template* you want to use.
. Optional: Select a stored search string in the *Bookmark* list to specify the target hosts.
. Optional: Further limit the targeted hosts by entering a *Search query*. The *Resolves to* line displays the number of hosts affected by your query. Use the refresh button to recalculate the number after changing the query. The preview icon lists the targeted hosts.
. The remaining settings depend on the selected job template. See xref:creating-a-job-template_{context}[] for information on adding custom parameters to a template.
. Optional: To configure advanced settings for the job, click *Display advanced fields*. Some of the advanced settings depend on the job template, the following settings are general:

* *Effective user* defines the user for executing the job, by default it is the SSH user.

* *Concurrency level* defines the maximum number of jobs executed at once, which can prevent overload of systems' resources in a case of executing the job on a large number of hosts.

* *Timeout to kill* defines time interval in seconds after which the job should be killed, if it is not finished already. A task which could not be started during the defined interval, for example, if the previous task took too long to finish, is canceled.

* *Type of query* defines when the search query is evaluated. This helps to keep the query up to date for scheduled tasks.

* *Execution ordering* determines the order in which the job is executed on hosts: alphabetical or randomized.
+
*Concurrency level* and *Timeout to kill* settings enable you to tailor job execution to fit your infrastructure hardware and needs.

. To run the job immediately, ensure that *Schedule* is set to *Execute now*. You can also define a one-time future job, or set up a recurring job. For recurring tasks, you can define start and end dates, number and frequency of runs. You can also use cron syntax to define repetition. For more information about cron, see the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/system_administrators_guide/ch-automating_system_tasks[Automating System Tasks] section of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 _System Administrator's Guide_.

. Click *Submit*. This displays the *Job Overview* page, and when the job completes, also displays the status of the job.

.For CLI Users

Enter the following command on {Project}:

----
# hammer settings set --name=remote_execution_global_proxy --value=false
----

To execute a remote job with custom parameters, complete the following steps:

. Find the ID of the job template you want to use:
+
----
# hammer job-template list
----

. Show the template details to see parameters required by your template:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# hammer job-template info --id _template_ID_
----

. Execute a remote job with custom parameters:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
#Â hammer job-invocation create \
--job-template "_template_name_" \
--inputs _key1_="_value_",_key2_="_value_",... \
--search-query "_query_"
----
+
Replace _query_ with the filter expression that defines hosts, for example `"name ~ rex01"`. For more information about executing remote commands with hammer, enter `hammer job-template --help` and `hammer job-invocation --help`.

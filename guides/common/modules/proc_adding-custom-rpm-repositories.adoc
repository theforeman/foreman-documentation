[[Adding_custom_RPM_Repositories]]
= Adding {customrpmtitle} Repositories

Use this procedure to add {customrpm} repositories in {Project}.
To use the CLI instead of the {ProjectWebUI}, see the xref:cli-adding-rpm-repositories[].

The Products window in the {ProjectWebUI} also provides a *Repo Discovery* function that finds all repositories from a URL and you can select which ones to add to your {customproduct}.
For example, you can use the *Repo Discovery* to search `http://yum.postgresql.org/9.5/redhat/` and list all repositories for different {RHEL} versions and architectures.
This helps users save time importing multiple repositories from a single source.

.Support for {customrpmtitle}s

Red Hat does not support the upstream RPMs directly from third-party sites.
These RPMs are used to demonstrate the synchronization process.
For any issues with these RPMs, contact the third-party developers.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Content* > *Products* and select the product that you want to use, and then click *New Repository*.
. In the *Name* field, enter a name for the repository.
{ProjectNameX} automatically completes the *Label* field based on what you have entered for *Name*.
. From the *Type* list, select the type of repository.
You can select either a repository for RPM files (`yum`), Docker images (`docker`), Files (`file`) or other. Note that if the `yum` content type is selected, you can restrict whether the repository is available to a host based on the host's architecture and OS version.
. Optional: From the *Restrict to Architecture* list, select the architecture. Ensure that *No restriction*, which is the default value, is selected to make the repository available to all hosts regardless of the architecture.
. Optional: From the *Restrict to OS Version* list, select the OS version. Ensure that *No restriction*, which is the default value, is selected to make the repository available to all hosts regardless of the OS version.
. In the *URL* field, enter the URL of the external repository to use as a source.
. From the *Download Policy* list, select the type of synchronization {ProjectServer} performs. See xref:Download_Policies_Overview[]
. Ensure that the *Mirror on Sync* check box is selected.
This ensures that the content that is no longer part of the upstream repository is removed during synchronization.
. From the *Checksum* list, select the checksum type for the repository.
. Optional: If you want, you can clear the *Publish via HTTP* check box to disable this repository from publishing through HTTP.
. Optional: From the *GPG Key* list, select the GPG key for the product.
. Click *Save*.

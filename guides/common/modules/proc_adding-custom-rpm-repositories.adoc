= Adding {customrpmtitle} Repositories

Use this procedure to add {customrpm} repositories in {Project}.
To use the CLI instead of the {ProjectWebUI}, see the xref:cli-adding-custom-rpm-repositories[].

The Products window in the {ProjectWebUI} also provides a *Repo Discovery* function that finds all repositories from a URL and you can select which ones to add to your {customproduct}.
For example, you can use the *Repo Discovery* to search `http://yum.postgresql.org/9.5/redhat/` and list all repositories for different {RHEL} versions and architectures.
This helps users save time importing multiple repositories from a single source.

.Support for {customrpmtitle}s
Red Hat does not support the upstream RPMs directly from third-party sites.
These RPMs are used to demonstrate the synchronization process.
For any issues with these RPMs, contact the third-party developers.

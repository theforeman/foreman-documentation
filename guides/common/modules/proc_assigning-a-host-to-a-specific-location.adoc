. Select the checkbox of the host you want to change.

[NOTE]
====
A mismatch happens if there is a resource associated with a host, such as a domain or subnet, and at the same time not associated with the location you want to assign the host to.
The option *Fix Location on Mismatch* will add such a resource to the location, and is therefore the recommended choice.
The option *Fail on Mismatch* will always result in an error message.
For example, reassigning a host from one location to another will fail, even if there is no actual mismatch in settings.
====
. Click *Submit*.

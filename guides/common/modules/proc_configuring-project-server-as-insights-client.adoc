= Configuring {ProjectServer} as {Insights} client

You can use {Insights} to diagnose systems and downtime related to security exploits, performance degradation, and stability failures.
You can use the dashboard to quickly identify key risks to stability, security, and performance.
You can sort by category, view details of the impact and resolution, and then determine what systems are affected.

Note that you do not require a {Insights} entitlement in your subscription manifest.

To maintain your {ProjectServer}, and improve your ability to monitor and diagnose problems you might have with {Project}, install the `insights-client` tool on {ProjectServer} and register {ProjectServer} with {Insights}.

.Procedure
. Register {ProjectServer} with {Insights}:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-installer} --register-with-insights
----
. Optional: You can change the default schedule for running `insights-client` by updating the system systemd settings and the `insights-client.timer` file on your {ProjectServer}.

.Verification
* Check that the system is registered with {Insights}:

----
# insights-client --status
----

.Next steps

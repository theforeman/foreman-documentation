= Uninstalling Capsule Server

Uninstalling Capsule Server deletes all applications that are used on the target system. If you use any applications or application data on the target system for purposes other than running Capsule Server, you must back up the information before uninstalling Capsule.

To uninstall Capsule, use the `katello-remove` command. Before deleting all packages and configuration files in the system, the `katello-remove` command displays two warnings that require your confirmation.

The `katello-remove` command deletes the following packages and configuration files:

  * httpd (apache)
  * mongodb
  * tomcat6
  * puppet
  * ruby
  * rubygems
  * All Katello and Foreman Packages

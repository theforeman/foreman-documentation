= Configuring {Project} to provision from a {LoraxCompose} image

In {Project}, you can enable integration with {the-Cockpit} to perform actions and monitor your hosts.
Using {the-Cockpit}, you can access {LoraxCompose} and build images that you can then upload to an HTTP server and use this image to provision hosts.
When you configure {Project} for image provisioning, Anaconda installer partitions disks, downloads and mounts the image and copies files over to a host.
The preferred image type is TAR.

Ensure that your blueprint to build the TAR image includes a kernel package.

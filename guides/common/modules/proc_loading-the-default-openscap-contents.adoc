= Loading the Default OpenSCAP Contents

Use this procedure to load the default OpenSCAP contents on {ProjectServer}.
This procedure ensures that the data streams from the *SCAP Security Guide* are loaded and assigned to all organizations and locations.

The *SCAP Security Guide* is provided by the {ProjectServer}'s operating system and installed in `/usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/`.
Note that the available data streams depend on the operating system version on which {Project} runs.
On {EL} 8, the package provides the SCAP contents only for {EL} 6{range}8.
For information on acquiring the SCAP content for {EL} 9, see xref:Uploading_Additional_SCAP_Content_{context}[].

= Managing Python type content

You can use {Project} to manage python type repositories.
To achieve this, {customproduct}s in {ProjectName} include repositories for python type content.
This provides a generic method to incorporate python packages in a product.

You can upload python packages to python type repositories and synchronize files from an upstream {ProjectServer}.
When you add python packages to a python type repository, you can use the normal {Project} management functions such as adding a specific version to a Content View to provide version control and making the repository available on various {SmartProxyServers}.
You must download the files on clients over HTTP or HTTPS using `curl -O`.

You can create an independent repository source in a directory on {ProjectServer}, or on a remote HTTP server, and then synchronize the contents of that directory into {Project}.
This method is useful when you have multiple python packages to add to a {customrepo}.

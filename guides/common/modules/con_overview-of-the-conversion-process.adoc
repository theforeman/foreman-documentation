= Overview of the conversion process

[role="_abstract"]
{Project} provides *Convert2RHEL* utilities to simplify the conversion process.

The conversion process is similar to a minor release upgrade of {RHEL} in which every RPM package on the system is replaced.
Third-party packages and non-Red Hat packages that are not available in {RHEL} are retained.

The Convert2RHEL utility removes unnecessary packages such as logos or packages known to cause issues during the conversion.
The utility replaces the `CentOS-release` or `Oracle-release` package with the `rhel-release` package, and all packages signed by CentOS or Oracle with their Red Hat equivalents.
The utility also subscribes the host to Red{nbsp}Hat Subscription Management.

The duration of the conversion process depends on the number of packages that have to be replaced, network speed, storage speed, and similar factors.

These following conversions are supported by {Team}:

* CentOS Linux 7 to {RHEL} 7
* Oracle Linux 7 to {RHEL} 7
* Oracle Linux 8 to {RHEL} 8

You can use the Ansible Playbook for other conversions as well, but in those cases you must enable required repositories and configure activation keys manually instead of using the Ansible role and variables.
However, this approach was not tested and is not supported.

If you convert to a RHEL version that is in the https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata#Extended_Life_Cycle_Phase[Extended Life Phase] and you do not plan to upgrade your host to a fully supported RHEL version, Red{nbsp}Hat recommends using an Extended Life Cycle Support (ELS) Add-On subscription during the conversion.
Note that the conversion and the subsequent upgrade without an ELS subscription come with a limited support scope per the https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/convert2rhel-support[RHEL Conversion Support Policy] and the https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/ipu-support[RHEL In-place upgrade Support Policy].

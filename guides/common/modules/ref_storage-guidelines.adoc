.Duplicated packages

Packages that are duplicated in different repositories are only stored once on the disk.

The bulk of storage resides in the `/var/lib/pulp/` directory.
These end points are not manually configurable.
Ensure that storage is available on the `/var` file system to prevent storage problems.

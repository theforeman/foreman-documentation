= Storage Guidelines

Consider the following guidelines when installing {ProductName} to increase efficiency.

* If you mount the `/tmp` directory as a separate file system, you must use the `exec` mount option in the `/etc/fstab` file.
If `/tmp` is already mounted with the `noexec` option, you must change the option to `exec` and re-mount the file system.
This is a requirement for the `puppetserver` service to work.

* Because most {ProductName} data is stored in the `/var` directory, mounting `/var` on LVM storage can help the system to scale.

* Using the same volume for the `/var/cache/pulp/` and `/var/lib/pulp/` directories can decrease the time required to move content from `/var/cache/pulp/` to `/var/lib/pulp/` after synchronizing.

* The `/var/lib/qpidd/` directory uses slightly more than 2 MB per Content Host managed by the `goferd` service.
For example, 10 000 Content Hosts require 20 GB of disk space in `/var/lib/qpidd/`.

* Use high-bandwidth, low-latency storage for the `/var/lib/pulp/` directories.
As {ProjectName} has many operations that are I/O intensive, using high latency, low-bandwidth storage causes performance degradation.
Ensure your installation has a speed in the range 60 - 80 Megabytes per second.

You can use the `fio` tool to get this data.
See the Red{nbsp}Hat Knowledgebase solution https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3397771[Impact of Disk Speed on Satellite Operations] for more information on using the `fio` tool.

.File System Guidelines

* Use the XFS file system for {ProjectNameX} because it does not have the inode limitations that `ext4` does.
Because {ProductName} uses a lot of symbolic links it is likely that your system might run out of inodes if using `ext4` and the default number of inodes.

* Do not use NFS for Pulp data storage.
Using NFS for Pulp has a negative performance impact on content synchronization.

* Do not use the GFS2 file system as the input-output latency is too high.

.Log File Storage

Log files are written to `/var/log/messages/,` `/var/log/httpd/`, and `/var/lib/foreman-proxy/openscap/content/`.
You can manage the size of these files using *logrotate*.
ifeval::["{build}" != "foreman-deb"]
For more information, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/system_administrators_guide/ch-viewing_and_managing_log_files#s2-log_rotation[Log Rotation] in the _Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 System Administratorâ€™s Guide_.
endif::[]

The exact amount of storage you require for log messages depends on your installation and setup.

.SELinux Considerations for NFS Mount

When the `/var/lib/pulp` directory is mounted using an NFS share, SELinux blocks the synchronization process.
To avoid this, specify the SELinux context of the `/var/lib/pulp` directory in the file system table by adding the following lines to `/etc/fstab`:

----
nfs.example.com:/nfsshare  /var/lib/pulp/content  nfs  context="system_u:object_r:httpd_sys_rw_content_t:s0"  1 2
----

If NFS share is already mounted, remount it using the above configuration and enter the following command:

----
# chcon -R system_u:object_r:httpd_sys_rw_content_t:s0 /var/lib/pulp
----

.Duplicated Packages

Packages that are duplicated in different repositories are only stored once on the disk.
Additional repositories containing duplicate packages require less additional storage.
The bulk of storage resides in the `/var/lib/pulp/` directory.
These end points are not manually configurable.
Ensure that storage is available on the `/var` file system to prevent storage problems.

.Temporary Storage

The `/var/cache/pulp/` directory is used to temporarily store content while it is being synchronized.
After a full synchronization task is completed, the content is moved to the `/var/lib/pulp/` directory.

For content in RPM format, each RPM file is moved to the `/var/lib/pulp` directory after it is synchronized.
A maximum of 5 RPM files are stored in the `/var/cache/pulp/` directory at any time.
Up to 8 RPM content synchronization tasks can run simultaneously by default, with each using up to 1 GB of metadata.

ifeval::["{build}" != "foreman-deb"]
.Software Collections

Software collections are installed in the `/opt/rh/` and `/opt/theforeman/` directories.

Write and execute permissions by the root user are required for installation to the `/opt` directory.

.Symbolic links

You cannot use symbolic links for `/var/lib/pulp/`.

ifeval::["{mode}" == "disconnected"]
.ISO Images
For content in ISO format, all ISO files per synchronization task are stored in `/var/cache/pulp/` until the task is complete, after which they are moved to the `/var/lib/pulp/` directory.

If you plan to use ISO images for installing or updating, you must provide external storage or allow space in `/var/tmp` for temporarily storing ISO files.

For example, if you are synchronizing four ISO files, each 4 GB in size, this requires a total of 16 GB in the `/var/cache/pulp/` directory.
Consider the number of ISO files you intend synchronizing because the temporary disk space required for them typically exceeds that of RPM content.

ifeval::["{mode}" == "connected"]
.Synchronized RHEL ISO
If you plan to synchronize RHEL content ISOs to {Project}, note that all minor versions of Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise Linux also synchronize.
You must plan to have adequate storage on your {Project} to manage this.

= Storage guidelines

Consider the following guidelines when installing {ProductName} to increase efficiency.

* If you mount the `/tmp` directory as a separate file system, you must use the `exec` mount option in the `/etc/fstab` file.
If `/tmp` is already mounted with the `noexec` option, you must change the option to `exec` and re-mount the file system.
This is a requirement for the `puppetserver` service to work.

* Because most {ProductName} data is stored in the `/var` directory, mounting `/var` on LVM storage can help the system to scale.

* Use high-bandwidth, low-latency storage for the `/var/lib/pulp/` and PostgreSQL `{postgresql-lib-dir}` directories.
As {ProjectName} has many operations that are I/O intensive, using high latency, low-bandwidth storage causes performance degradation.

You can use the `storage-benchmark` script to get this data.

.File system guidelines

* Do not use the GFS2 file system as the input-output latency is too high.

.Log file storage

Log files are written to `/var/log/messages/,` `/var/log/httpd/`, and `/var/lib/foreman-proxy/openscap/content/`.
You can manage the size of these files using *logrotate*.

For more information, see https://access.redhat.com/solutions/1294[How to use logrotate utility to rotate log files].

The exact amount of storage you require for log messages depends on your installation and setup.

.SELinux considerations for NFS mount

When the `/var/lib/pulp` directory is mounted using an NFS share, SELinux blocks the synchronization process.
To avoid this, specify the SELinux context of the `/var/lib/pulp` directory in the file system table by adding the following lines to `/etc/fstab`:

----
nfs.example.com:/nfsshare  /var/lib/pulp  nfs  context="system_u:object_r:var_lib_t:s0"  1 2
----

If NFS share is already mounted, remount it using the above configuration and enter the following command:

----
# restorecon -R /var/lib/pulp
----

.Duplicated packages

Packages that are duplicated in different repositories are only stored once on the disk.
Additional repositories containing duplicate packages require less additional storage.
The bulk of storage resides in the `/var/lib/pulp/` directory.
These end points are not manually configurable.
Ensure that storage is available on the `/var` file system to prevent storage problems.

.Symbolic links

You cannot use symbolic links for `/var/lib/pulp/`.

.Synchronized RHEL ISO
If you plan to synchronize RHEL content ISOs to {Project}, note that all minor versions of {RHEL} also synchronize.
You must plan to have adequate storage on your {Project} to manage this.

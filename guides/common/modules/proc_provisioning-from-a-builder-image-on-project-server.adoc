When you provision from a {LoraxCompose} image, Anaconda installer partitions disks, downloads and mounts the image, and copies files over to a host.

.Prerequisites
* An existing ISO image created by using {LoraxCompose}.
Ensure that your blueprint to build the image includes a kernel package.

.Procedure
. On {Project}, create a custom product, add a custom file repository to this product, and upload the image to the repository.
For more information, see {ContentManagementDocURL}Importing_Individual_ISO_Images_and_Files_content-management[Importing Individual ISO Images and Files] in _{ContentManagementDocTitle}_.
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Configure* > *Host Groups*.

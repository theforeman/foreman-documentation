= Exporting the Library environment incrementally

Exporting Library content can be a very expensive operation in terms of system resources.
ifdef::orcharhino[]
The size of the exported Library depends on the number of products.
endif::[]
Organizations that have multiple {RHEL} trees can occupy several gigabytes of space on {ProjectServer}.

In such cases, you can create an incremental export which contains only pieces of content that have changed since the last export.
Incremental exports typically result in smaller archive files than the full exports.

The example below shows incremental export of all repositories in the organization's Library.

.Procedure
. Create an incremental export:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# hammer content-export incremental library \
--organization="_My_Organization_"
----
include::snip_syncable-exports.adoc[]

.Next steps
* Optional: View the exported data:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# find /var/lib/pulp/exports/_My_Organization_/Export-Library/

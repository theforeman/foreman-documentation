= Monitoring hosts by using {Insights} in {RHCloud}

[role="_abstract"]
You can use the {Insights} advisor service in the {RHCloud} to assess system health on hosts running {RHEL}.
You can use the {Insights} dashboard in the {RHCloud} to quickly analyze recommendations for remediation, vulnerabilities, and more.

If you use {Insights} in the {RHCloud}:

* You can use {Insights} services online in the {RHCloud}.
* The Insights client collects data of your hosts and {Project} forwards the data through the Insights client to the {RHCloud} to calculate recommendations.
* You can view and remediate those recommendations both in the {ProjectWebUI} and in the {RHCloud}.
* {Project} uploads host inventory reports to the {RHCloud}.
* You have control over how much information is included in those reports.
* You cannot use local {insights-iop}.

Your environment must meet the following requirements:
* Install and configure the Insights client on hosts during host registration or provisioning.
For more information, see xref:Registering_Hosts_by_Using_Global_Registration_managing-hosts[].
* For hosts already registered to {Project}, install and configure the Insights client on your hosts by using an Ansible role.
For more information, see xref:deploying-insights-client-on-registered-hosts_{context}[].

* If you register your host to a new {ProjectServer}, reregister the host to {Insights} to avoid creating duplicate entries.

* You can change the schedule for running the Insights client by configuring `insights-client.timer` on a host.

To troubleshoot hosts monitoring, you can try the following approaches:
* You can find the logs in the `/var/log/foreman/production.log` file.
* If you have problems connecting to {Insights}, ensure that your certificates are up-to-date.
Refresh your subscription manifest to update your certificates.

[id="Managing_Locations_{context}"]
= Managing locations

Locations function similar to organizations: they provide a method to group resources and assign hosts.
Organizations and locations have the following conceptual differences:

* Locations are based on physical or geographical settings.
* Locations have a hierarchical structure.

You can structure locations hierarchically by providing a parent location.
Unless otherwise specified, locations inherit the settings from their parent location.

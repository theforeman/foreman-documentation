= Assigning a rolling content view to lifecycle environments by using {ProjectWebUI}

[role="_abstract"]
You can assign your rolling content view to lifecycle environments to limit Library content synchronized to {SmartProxyServers} by using the {ProjectWebUI}.

To consume rolling content views, you must assign them to one or more lifecycle environments.
By doing so, you expose a subset of Library content to those lifecycle environments.
{Team} does not recommend assigning a rolling content view to the Library environment itself because it creates duplicate content within Library.
By using environments other than Library, you can synchronize your rolling content views from {ProjectServer} to any {SmartProxyServers} that are configured to consume the relevant lifecycle environments without the need to synchronize all of Library to {SmartProxyServers}.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Content* > *Lifecycle* > *Content Views*.
. Select your rolling content view.
. Select the *Details* tab.
. In the *Lifecycle Environments* field, assign your rolling content view to your lifecycle environments.
. Click *Save Environments* to submit your changes to {Project}.

.Next steps
* Synchronize lifecycle environments to {SmartProxyServers}.

= Creating Operating Systems

An operating system is a collection of resources that define how {ProjectServer} installs a base operating system on a host.
Operating system entries combine previously defined resources, such as installation media, partition tables, provisioning templates, and others.

ifeval::["{build}" != "foreman-deb"]
Importing operating systems from Red Hat's CDN creates new entries on the *Hosts* > *Operating Systems* page.
endif::[]
ifeval::["{build}" == "foreman-el"]
Importing operating systems from Red Hat's CDN is only possible when Katello is installed.
endif::[]

You can also add custom operating systems using the following procedure:

.Procedure

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Hosts* > *Operating systems* and click *New Operating* system.
. In the *Name* field, enter a name to represent the operating system entry.
. In the *Major* field, enter the number that corresponds to the major version of the operating system.
. In the *Minor* field, enter the number that corresponds to the minor version of the operating system.
. In the *Description* field, enter a description of the operating system.
. From the *Family* list, select the operating system's family.
. From the *Root Password Hash* list, select the encoding method for the root password.
. From the *Architectures* list, select the architectures that the operating system uses.
. Click the *Partition table* tab and select the possible partition tables that apply to this operating system.
ifeval::["{build}" == "satellite"]
. Optional: if you use non-Red{nbsp}Hat content, click the Installation media tab and select the installation media that apply to this operating system.
For more information, see xref:adding-installation-media_provisioning[].
endif::[]
ifeval::["{build}" != "satellite"]
. Click the Installation Media tab and enter the information for the installation media source.
For more information, see xref:adding-installation-media_provisioning[].
endif::[]
. Click the *Templates* tab and select a *PXELinux template*, a *Provisioning template*, and a *Finish template* for your operating system to use.
You can select other templates, for example an *iPXE template*, if you plan to use iPXE for provisioning.
. Click *Submit* to save your provisioning template.

.For CLI Users

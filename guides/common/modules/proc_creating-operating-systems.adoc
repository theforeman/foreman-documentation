= Creating Operating Systems

An operating system is a collection of resources that define how {ProjectServer} installs a base operating system on a host. Operating system entries combine previously defined resources, such as installation media, partition tables, provisioning templates, and others.

ifeval::["{build}" != "foreman-deb"]
Importing operating systems from Red Hat's CDN creates new entries on the *Hosts* > *Operating Systems* page.
endif::[]
ifeval::["{build}" == "foreman"]
Importing operating systems from Red Hat's CDN is only possible when Katello is installed.
endif::[]

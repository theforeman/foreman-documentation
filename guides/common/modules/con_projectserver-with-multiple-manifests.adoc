= {ProjectServer} with multiple manifests

If you plan to have more than one Red{nbsp}Hat{nbsp}Network account, or if you want to manage systems belonging to another entity that is also a Red{nbsp}Hat{nbsp}Network account holder, then you and the other account holder can assign subscriptions, as required, to manifests.
A customer that does not have a {Project} subscription can create a Subscription Asset Manager manifest, which can be used with {Project}, if they have other valid subscriptions.
You can then use the multiple manifests in one {ProjectServer} to manage multiple organizations.

If you must manage systems but do not have access to the subscriptions for the RPMs, you must use {RHEL} {Project} Add-On.
For more information, see https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/satellite[{Project} Add-On].
endif::[]

The following diagram shows two Red{nbsp}Hat{nbsp}Network account holders, who want their systems to be managed by the same {Project} installation.
In this scenario, Example Corporation 1 can allocate any subset of their 60 subscriptions, in this example they have allocated 30, to a manifest.
This can be imported into the {Project} as a distinct Organization.
This allows system administrators the ability to manage Example Corporation 1's systems using {Project} completely independently of Example Corporation 2's organizations (R&D, Operations, and Engineering).

When creating a Red{nbsp}Hat subscription manifest:

* Add the subscription for {ProjectServer} to the manifest if planning a disconnected or self-registered {ProjectServer}.
This is not necessary for a connected {ProjectServer} that is subscribed using the Subscription Manager utility on the base system.
* Add subscriptions for all {SmartProxyServers} you want to create.
* Add subscriptions for all Red{nbsp}Hat products you want to manage with {Project}.
* Note the date when the subscriptions are due to expire and plan for their renewal before the expiry date.
* Create one manifest per organization.
You can use multiple manifests and they can be from different Red Hat subscriptions.

{ProjectName} allows the use of future-dated subscriptions in the manifest.
This enables uninterrupted access to repositories when future-dated subscriptions are added to a manifest before the expiry date of existing subscriptions.

Note that the Red{nbsp}Hat subscription manifest can be modified and reloaded to {ProjectServer} in case of any changes in your infrastructure, or when adding more subscriptions.
Manifests should not be deleted.
If you delete the manifest from the Red Hat Customer Portal or in the {ProjectWebUI} it will unregister all of your content hosts.

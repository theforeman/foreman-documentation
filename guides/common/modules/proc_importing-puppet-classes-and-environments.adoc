= Importing Puppet classes and environments into {Project}

[role="_abstract"]
Import Puppet classes and environments from the installed Puppet modules to {ProjectServer} or any attached {SmartProxyServer} before you assign any of the classes to hosts.

.Prerequisites
* Ensure to select *Any Organization* and *Any Location* as context, otherwise the import might fail.
* Before you run an import of Puppet modules into {Project}, the environment must already exist as the folder `/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/_example_environment_` on the Puppet server and contain installed Puppet modules.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Configure* > *Puppet ENC* > *Classes* or *Configure* > *Puppet ENC* > *Environments*.
. Click *Import* in the upper right corner and select which {SmartProxy} you want to import modules from.
You may typically choose between your {ProjectServer} or any attached {SmartProxyServer}.
. Select the Puppet environments to import using checkboxes on the left.
. Click *Update* to import the Puppet environments and classes to {Project}.
. The import should result in a notification as follows:

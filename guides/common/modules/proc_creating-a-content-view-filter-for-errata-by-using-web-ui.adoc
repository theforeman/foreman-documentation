= Creating a content view filter for errata by using {ProjectWebUI}

You can use content filters to limit errata.
Such filters include:

* *ID* {endash} Select specific erratum to allow into your resulting repositories.
* *Date Range* {endash} Define a date range and include a set of errata released during that date range.
* *Type* {endash} Select the type of errata to include such as bug fixes, enhancements, and security updates.

Create a content filter to exclude errata after a certain date.
This ensures your production systems in the application lifecycle are kept up to date to a certain point.
Then you can modify the filter's start date to introduce new errata into your testing environment to test the compatibility of new packages into your application lifecycle.

.Prerequisites
* A content view with the repositories that contain required errata is created.
For more information, see xref:Creating_a_Content_View_{context}[].

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Content* > *Lifecycle* > *Content Views*.
. Select a content view that you want to use for applying errata.
. On the *Filters* tab, click *Create Filter*.
. In the *Name* field, enter `Errata Filter`.
. From the *Content Type* list, select *Errata {endash} by date range*.
. Select *Exclude filter*.
. Optional: In the *Description* field, enter `Exclude errata items from _YYYY-MM-DD_`.
. Click *Create filter*.
. For *Errata Type*, select the checkboxes of errata types you want to exclude.
For example, select the *Enhancement* and *Bugfix* checkboxes and clear the *Security* checkbox to exclude enhancement and bugfix errata after certain date, but include all the security errata.
. For *Date Type*, select one of two checkboxes:
+
* *Updated from* for the date of the last update of the erratum.
+
* *Issued from* for the issued date of the erratum.
. Select the *Start Date* to exclude all errata on or after the selected date.
. Leave the *End Date* field blank.
. Click *Save*.
. Click *Publish New Version* to publish the resulting repository.
. Enter `Adding errata filter` in the *Description* field.
. Click *Save*.
+
When the content view completes publication, notice the *Content* column reports a reduced number of packages and errata from the initial repository.
This means the filter successfully excluded the all non-security errata from the last year.

. Click the *Versions* tab.
. Click *Promote* to the right of the published version.
. Select the environments you want to promote the content view version to.
. In the *Description* field, enter the description for promoting.
. Click *Promote Version* to promote this content view version across the required environments.

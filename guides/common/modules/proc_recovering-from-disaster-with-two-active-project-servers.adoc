= Recovering from disaster with two active {ProjectServer}s

[role="_abstract"]
If the health checks implemented in xref:preparing-for-disaster-recovery-with-two-active-project-servers[] report an issue on one of your {ProjectServer}s, it might mean that the server has failed.
If the server is down, you must re-register hosts to the other server.

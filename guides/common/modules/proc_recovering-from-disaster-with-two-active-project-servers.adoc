= Recovering from disaster with two active {ProjectServer}s

If the health checks implemented in xref:preparing-for-disaster-recovery-with-two-active-project-servers[] report an issue on one of your {ProjectServer}s, it might mean that the server has failed.
If the server is down, you must re-register hosts to the other server.

.Procedure
. Verify the status of the server:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} health check
----
. If `{foreman-maintain} health check` reported a problem, ensure that the server is powered off.
. Re-register all hosts from the data center managed by the failed server to the other, functional server.

.Verification
* Verify that hosts have been properly re-registered.

.Additional resources
* Ansible playbooks can help you automate failover, re-registration, and synchronization.

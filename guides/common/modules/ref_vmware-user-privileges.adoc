= VMware user privileges

[role="_abstract"]
The VMware vSphere server requires an administration-like user for {ProjectServer} communication.
For security reasons, do not use the `administrator` user for such communication.
Instead, create a user with the required privileges.

In VMware vCenter Server version 8.0 or 7.0, set the following privileges:

* All Privileges -> Datastore -> Allocate Space, Browse datastore, Update Virtual Machine files, Low level file operations
* All Privileges -> Network -> Assign Network
* All Privileges -> Resource -> Assign virtual machine to resource pool
* All Privileges -> Virtual Machine -> Change Config (All)
* All Privileges -> Virtual Machine -> Interaction (All)
* All Privileges -> Virtual Machine -> Edit Inventory (All)
* All Privileges -> Virtual Machine -> Provisioning (All)
* All Privileges -> Virtual Machine -> Guest Operations (All)

If you want to create virtual machines with a Virtual Trusted Platform Module (TPM) for enhanced security, set the following privileges:

* All Privileges -> Cryptographic operations -> Clone, Encrypt, Encrypt new, Migrate, Register VM
* All Privileges -> Cryptographic operations -> Direct Access {endash} required to open a console session

If you want to take snapshots of virtual machines by using the Snapshot Management plugin, set the following privileges:

* All Privileges -> Virtual Machine -> Snapshot management (All)

= Deleting Audit Records

Audit records are created automatically in {Project}.
You can use the `foreman-rake audits:expire` command to remove audits at any time.
You can also use a cron job to schedule audit record deletions at the set interval that you want.

By default, using the `foreman-rake audits:expire` command removes audit records that are older than 90 days.
You can specify the number of days to keep the audit records by adding the *days* option and add the number of days.

For example, if you want to delete audit records that are older than seven days, enter the following command:

----
# foreman-rake audits:expire days=7
----

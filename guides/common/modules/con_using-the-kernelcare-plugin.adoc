= Using the KernelCare plugin

[role="_abstract"]
You can use the KernelCare plugin to patch the Linux kernel on hosts without rebooting them.
The plugin provides job templates to view and live-patch the Linux kernel on hosts and ensures hosts do not report to {ProjectServer} that a reboot is required through tracer.
For more information, see https://tuxcare.com/enterprise-live-patching-services/[tuxcare.com/enterprise-live-patching-services] and https://docs.tuxcare.com/live-patching-services/[docs.tuxcare.com/live-patching-services].

[IMPORTANT]
====
The KernelCare plugin is a technical preview.
{Team} does not recommend running this in your production environment.

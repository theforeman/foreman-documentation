= Discovery in PXE mode

[role="_abstract"]
{Project} provides a PXE-based Discovery service that uses DHCP and TFTP services.
You discover unknown nodes by booting them into the Discovery kernel and initial RAM disk images from {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer}.
When a discovered node is scheduled for installation, it reboots and continues with the configured PXE-based host provisioning.

= Discovery in PXE mode

{Project} provides a PXE-based Discovery service that operates with the use of DHCP and TFTP services.
You accomplish this by booting unknown nodes into the Discovery kernel and initial ramdisk images from {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer}.
Once a discovered node is scheduled for installation, it reboots and continues with the configured PXE-based provisioning.

= Preparing a synchronized Kickstart repository

{Project} contains a set of synchronized Kickstart repositories that you use to install the provisioned host's operating system.
For more information about adding repositories, see {ContentManagementDocURL}Synchronizing_Repositories_content-management[Syncing Repositories] in _{ContentManagementDocTitle}_.

Use this procedure to set up a Kickstart repository.

.Prerequisites
You must enable both *BaseOS* and *Appstream Kickstart* before provisioning.

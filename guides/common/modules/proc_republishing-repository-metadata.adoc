= Republishing repository metadata

You can republish repository metadata when a repository distribution does not have the content that should be distributed based on the contents of the repository.

Use this procedure with caution.
{Team} recommends a complete repository sync or publishing a new content view version to repair broken metadata.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Content* > *Products*.
. Select the product that includes the repository for which you want to republish metadata.
. On the *Repositories* tab, select a repository.
. To republish metadata for the repository, click *Republish Repository Metadata* from the *Select Action* menu.
+
[NOTE]
====
This action is not available for repositories that use the *Complete Mirroring* policy because the metadata is copied verbatim from the upstream source of the repository.

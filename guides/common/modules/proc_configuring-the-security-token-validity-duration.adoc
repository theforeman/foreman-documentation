= Configuring the Security Token Validity Duration

When performing any kind of provisioning, as a security measure, {Project} automatically generates a unique token and adds this token to the {provision-script} URL in the PXE configuration file (PXELinux, Grub2).
By default, the token is valid for 360 minutes.
When you provision a host, ensure that you reboot the host within this time frame.
If the token expires, it is no longer valid and you receive a 404 error and the operating system installer download fails.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Administer*{nbsp}>{nbsp}*Settings*, and click the *Provisioning* tab.
. Find the *Token duration* option and click the edit icon and edit the duration, or enter `0` to disable token generation.
If token generation is disabled, an attacker can spoof client IP address and download {provision-script} from {ProjectServer}, including the encrypted root password.

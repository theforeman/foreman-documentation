= Kickstart Workflow

You can automate the installation process of a {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer} by creating a Kickstart file that contains all the information that is required for the installation.

When you run a {ProjectName} Kickstart script, the script performs the following actions:

. It specifies the installation location of a {ProjectServer} or a {SmartProxyServer}.
. It installs the predefined packages.
. It installs Subscription Manager.
. It uses Activation Keys to subscribe the hosts to {ProjectName}.
. It installs Puppet, and configures a `puppet.conf` file to indicate the {ProjectName} or {SmartProxy} instance.
. It enables Puppet to run and request a certificate.
. It runs user defined snippets.

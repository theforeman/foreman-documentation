= Best practices for role-based access control in {Project}

* Define the expected tasks and responsibilities:
Define the subset of the {Project} infrastructure that you want the role to access as well as actions permitted on this subset.
Think of the responsibilities of the role and how it differs from other roles.

* Use predefined roles whenever possible:
{Project} provides several sample roles that you can use.
Copying and editing an existing role can be a good start for creating a custom role.

* Adopt a granular approach to user role management:
Define roles with specific, well-scoped permissions.
Note that each user can have multiple roles assigned and that permissions from these roles are cumulative.

* Add permissions gradually and test the results:
When creating a custom role, start with a limited set of permissions and add permissions one by one, while testing continuously.
Ensure to test your custom role to verify that it works as intended.

* Consider areas of interest and granting read-only access:
Even though a role has a limited area of responsibility, it might need a wider set of permissions.
Therefore, you can grant the role a read-only access to parts of {Project} infrastructure that influence its area of responsibility.

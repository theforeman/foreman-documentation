* Mirroring content from {ProjectServer} to establish content sources in various geographical or logical locations.
By registering a host to a {SmartProxyServer}, you can configure this host to receive content and configuration from the {SmartProxy} in their location instead of from the central {ProjectServer}.

By using content views, you can specify the exact subset of content that {SmartProxyServer} makes available to hosts.

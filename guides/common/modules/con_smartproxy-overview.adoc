With {SmartProxyServers}, you can extend the reach and scalability of your {Project} deployment.
{SmartProxyServers} provide the following functionalities in a {ProjectName} deployment:

* Mirroring content from {ProjectServer} to establish content sources in various geographical or logical locations.
By registering a host to a {SmartProxyServer}, you can configure this host to receive content and configuration from the {SmartProxy} in their location instead of from the central {ProjectServer}.
* Running localized services to discover, provision, control, and configure hosts.

By using content views, you can specify the exact subset of content that {SmartProxyServer} makes available to hosts.

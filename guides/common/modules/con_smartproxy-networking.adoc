[id="{smart-proxy-context}-networking_{context}"]
= {SmartProxy} networking

The communication between {ProjectServer} and hosts registered to a {SmartProxyServer} is routed through that {SmartProxyServer}.
{SmartProxyServer} also provides {Project} services to hosts.

Many of the services that {SmartProxyServer} manages use dedicated network ports.
However, {SmartProxyServer} ensures that all communications from the host to {ProjectServer} use a single source IP address, which simplifies firewall administration.

In xref:{project-context}-topology-with-hosts-connecting-to-a-{smart-proxy-context}[], {SmartProxy} provides a single endpoint for all host network communications so that in remote network segments, only firewall ports to the {SmartProxy} itself must be open.

In xref:{project-context}-topology-with-hosts-connecting-directly-to-{project-context}-server[], hosts connect to {ProjectServer} rather than a {SmartProxy}.
This applies also to {SmartProxies} themselves because the {SmartProxyServer} is a host of {ProjectServer}.

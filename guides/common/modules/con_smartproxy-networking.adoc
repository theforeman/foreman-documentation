[id="{SmartProxy}-Networking_{context}"]
= {SmartProxy} Networking

The communication between managed hosts and {ProjectServer} is routed through {SmartProxyServer}.
{SmartProxyServer} can also manage multiple services on behalf of hosts.

Many of the services that {SmartProxyServer} manages use dedicated network ports.
However, {SmartProxyServer} ensures that all communications from the host to {ProjectServer} use a single source IP address, which simplifies firewall administration.

.{Project} topology with hosts connecting to a {SmartProxy}

In this topology, {SmartProxy} provides a single endpoint for all host network communications so that in remote network segments, only firewall ports to the {SmartProxy} itself must be open.

.{Project} topology with hosts connecting directly to {ProjectServer}

In this topology, hosts connect to {ProjectServer} rather than an isolated {SmartProxy}.
This situation applies also to {SmartProxies} themselves because the base system of an external {SmartProxy} is a client of {ProjectServer}.

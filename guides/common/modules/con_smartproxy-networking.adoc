= {SmartProxy} networking

The communication between {ProjectServer} and hosts registered to a {SmartProxyServer} is routed through that {SmartProxyServer}.
{SmartProxyServer} also provides {Project} services to hosts.

Many of the services that {SmartProxyServer} manages use dedicated network ports.
However, {SmartProxyServer} ensures that all communications from the host to {ProjectServer} use a single source IP address, which simplifies firewall administration.

.{Project} topology with hosts connecting to a {SmartProxy}
In this topology, {SmartProxy} provides a single endpoint for all host network communications so that in remote network segments, only firewall ports to the {SmartProxy} itself must be open.

.{Project} topology with hosts connecting directly to {ProjectServer}
In this topology, hosts connect to {ProjectServer} rather than a {SmartProxy}.
This applies also to {SmartProxies} themselves because the {SmartProxyServer} is a host of {ProjectServer}.

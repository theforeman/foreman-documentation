ifeval::["{build}" == "satellite"]
When you install {ProjectServer} from a connected network, you can obtain packages and receive updates directly from the Red Hat Content Delivery Network.
endif::[]

Note that the {ProjectX} installation script is based on Puppet, which means that if you run the installation script more than once, it might overwrite any manual configuration changes.
‚Å†
To avoid this and determine which future changes apply, use the `--noop` argument when you run the installation script. This argument ensures that no actual changes are made. Potential changes are written to `/var/log/foreman-installer.log`.

Files are always backed up and so you can revert any unwanted changes. For example, in the foreman-installer logs, you can see an entry similar to the following about Filebucket:

[options="wrap"]
----
/Stage[main]/Dhcp/File[/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf]: Filebucketed /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf to puppet with sum 622d9820b8e764ab124367c68f5fa3a1
----

You can restore the previous file as follows:

[options="wrap"]
----
# puppet filebucket -l \
restore /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf 622d9820b8e764ab124367c68f5fa3a1

= Adding a VMware connection to {ProjectServer} by using {ProjectWebUI}

[role="_abstract"]
Use this procedure to add a VMware vSphere connection in {ProjectServer}'s compute resources.

.Prerequisites
* Ensure that the host and network-based firewalls are configured to allow communication from {ProjectServer} to vCenter on TCP port 443.
* Verify that {ProjectServer} and vCenter can resolve each other's host names.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Infrastructure* > *Compute Resources*, and in the Compute Resources window, click *Create Compute Resource*.
. In the *Name* field, enter a name for the resource.
. From the *Provider* list, select *VMware*.
. In the *Description* field, enter a description for the resource.
. In the *VCenter/Server* field, enter the IP address or host name of the vCenter server.
. In the *User* field, enter the user name with permission to access the vCenter's resources.
. In the *Password* field, enter the password for the user.
. Click *Load Datacenters* to populate the list of data centers from your VMware vSphere environment.
. From the *Datacenter* list, select a specific data center to manage from this list.
. In the *Fingerprint* field, ensure that this field is populated with the fingerprint from the data center.
. From the *Display Type* list, select a console type, for example, *VNC* or *VMRC*.
Note that VNC consoles are unsupported on VMware ESXi 6.5 and later.
. Optional: In the *VNC Console Passwords* field, select the *Set a randomly generated password on the display connection* checkbox to secure console access for new hosts with a randomly generated password.
. From the *Enable Caching* list, you can select whether to enable caching of compute resources.
For more information, see xref:Caching_of_Compute_Resources_{context}[].
. Click the *Locations* and *Organizations* tabs and verify that the values are automatically set to your current context.
You can also add additional contexts.
. Click *Submit* to save the connection.

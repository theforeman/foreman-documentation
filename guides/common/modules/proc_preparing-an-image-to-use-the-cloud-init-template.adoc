.Procedure

. To use the `cloud-init` template for provisioning, you must configure a virtual machine so that `cloud-init` is installed, enabled, and configured to call back to {ProjectServer}.
. For security purposes, you must install a CA certificate to use HTTPS for all communication.
This procedure includes steps to clean the virtual machine so that no unwanted information transfers to the image you use for provisioning.
. If you have an image with `cloud-init`, you must still follow this procedure to enable `cloud-init` to communicate with {Project} because `cloud-init` is disabled by default.

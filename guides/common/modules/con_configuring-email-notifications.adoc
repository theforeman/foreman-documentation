= Configuring email notifications

[role="_abstract"]
Email notifications are created by {ProjectServer} periodically or after completion of certain events.
The periodic notifications can be sent daily, weekly or monthly.

For an overview of available notification types, see xref:Email_Notification_Types_{context}[].

Users do not receive any email notifications by default.
An administrator can configure users to receive notifications based on criteria such as the type of notification, and frequency.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{ProjectServer} does not enable outgoing emails by default, therefore you must review your email configuration.

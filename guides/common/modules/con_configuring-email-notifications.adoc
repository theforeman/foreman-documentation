[id="Configuring_Email_Notifications_{context}"]
= Configuring Email Notifications

Email notifications are created by {ProjectServer} periodically or after completion of certain events.
The periodic notifications can be sent daily, weekly or monthly.

For the events that trigger a notification and notification types, see xref:Notification_Types_{context}[].

Users do not receive any email notifications by default.
An administrator can configure users to receive notifications based on criteria such as the type of notification, and frequency.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{ProjectServer} does not enable outgoing emails by default, therefore you must review your email configuration.
For more information, see {InstallingServerDocURL}Configuring_Server_for_Outgoing_Emails_{project-context}[Configuring {ProjectServer} for Outgoing Emails] in _{InstallingServerDocTitle}_.

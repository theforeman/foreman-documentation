= Configuring a proxy for PXE files downloads

For Red Hat content served through the Content Delivery Network, {SmartProxy} downloads PXE files from synchronized repositories. However, when configuring and installing an operating system using Installation Media, {SmartProxy} connects directly using the `wget` utility.

.Procedure

. On {SmartProxy} with the TFTP feature, to verify the ports that are permitted by SELinux for the HTTP cache, enter the following command:
+
[options="nowrap",subs="+quotes"]
----
# systemctl edit foreman-proxy
----
+
. Insert the following test into the editor:
+
[options="nowrap",subs="+quotes"]
----
[Service]
Environment="http_proxy=http://proxy.example.com:8888"
Environment="https_proxy=https://proxy.example.com:8888"
----
+
. Save the file. Verify that the file appears as `/etc/systemd/system/foreman-proxy.service.d/overrides.conf`.
. Restart the `foreman-proxy` service:
+
[options="nowrap",subs="+quotes"]
----
# systemctl restart foreman-proxy
----
+
. Create a host or enter build mode for an existing host to re-download PXE files to the TFTP {SmartProxy}.

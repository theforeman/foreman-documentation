= Integrating a remote ISC DHCP server

If you have an ISC DHCP server in your network, but not on the same host as your {ProjectServer}, you can integrate this service into your {ProjectServer}.
The integration enables you to continue using your existing DHCP server, and {Project} manages IP leases and boot configurations on the DHCP server during the provisioning of hosts.

With this type of integration, {Project} uses an Object Management Application Programming Interface (OMAPI) key to update leases and the Network File System (NFS) protocol to access the ISC DHCP server's configuration files and lease database.

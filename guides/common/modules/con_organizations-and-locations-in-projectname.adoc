[role="_abstract"]
On the {ProjectServer}, you can define multiple _organizations_ and _locations_ to help organize content, managed hosts, and configurations.

Organizations::
Organizations typically represent different business units, departments, or teams, such as Finance, Marketing, or Web Development Team.
+
By creating organizations, you can create logical containers to isolate and manage their configurations separately according to their specific requirements.

Locations::
Locations typically represent physical locations, such as countries or cities.
+
By creating locations, you can define geographical sites where systems are located.
For example, this is useful in environments with multiple data centers.

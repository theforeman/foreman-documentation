= Attaching Red Hat Subscriptions to Content Hosts

Using activation keys is the main method to attach subscriptions to content hosts during the provisioning process.
However, an activation key cannot update an existing host.
If you need to attach new or additional subscriptions, such as future-dated subscriptions, to one host, use the following procedure.

.{Project} Subscriptions

In {Project}, you must maintain a {RHEL} {Project} subscription, formerly known as {RHEL} Smart Management, for every {RHEL} host that you want to manage.

However, you are not required to attach {Project} subscriptions to each content host.
{Project} subscriptions cannot attach automatically to content hosts in {Project} because they are not associated with any product certificates.
Adding a {Project} subscription to a content host does not provide any content or repository access.
If you want, you can add a {Project} subscription to a manifest for your own recording or tracking purposes.

.Prerequisite
* You must have a Red{nbsp}Hat Subscription Manifest file imported to {ProjectServer}.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, ensure the context is set to the organization you want to use.
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Hosts* > *Content Hosts*.
. On the row of each content host whose subscription you want to change, select the corresponding checkbox.
. From the *Select Action* list, select *Manage Subscriptions*.
. Optionally, enter a key and value in the *Search* field to filter the subscriptions displayed.
. Select the checkbox to the left of the subscriptions that you want to add or remove and click *Add Selected* or *Remove Selected* as required.
. Click *Done* to save the changes.

.CLI procedure
. Connect to {ProjectServer} as the root user, and then list the available subscriptions:
+
[subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer subscription list \
--organization-id 1
----
. Attach a subscription to the host:
+
[subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer host subscription attach \
--host _host_name_ \
--subscription-id _subscription_id_
----

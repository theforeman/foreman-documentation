= Attaching Red Hat Subscriptions to Content Hosts

Using activation keys is the main method to attach subscriptions to content hosts during the provisioning process.
However, an activation key cannot update an existing host.
If you need to attach new or additional subscriptions, such as future-dated subscriptions, to one host, use the following procedure.

For more information about updating multiple hosts, see xref:Updating_Red_Hat_Subscriptions_on_Multiple_Hosts_{context}[].
For more information about activation keys, see xref:Managing_Activation_Keys_{context}[].

.Smart Management Subscriptions

In {Project}, you must maintain a {RHEL} Smart Management subscription for every {RHEL} host that you want to manage.

However, you are not required to attach Smart Management subscriptions to each content host.
Smart Management subscriptions cannot attach automatically to content hosts in {Project} because they are not associated with any product certificates.
Adding a Smart Management subscription to a content host does not provide any content or repository access.
If you want, you can add a Smart Management subscription to a manifest for your own recording or tracking purposes.

.Prerequisite
* You must have a Red{nbsp}Hat Subscription Manifest file imported to {ProjectServer}.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, ensure the context is set to the organization you want to use.
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Hosts* > *Content Hosts*.
. On the row of each content host whose subscription you want to change, click the corresponding check box.
. From the *Select Action* list, click *Manage Subscriptions*.
. Optionally, enter a key and value in the *Search* field to filter the subscriptions displayed.
. Click the check box to the left of the subscriptions that you want to add or remove and click *Add Selected* or *Remove Selected* as required.
. Click *Done* to save the changes.

.CLI procedure
. Connect to {ProjectServer} as the root user, and then list the available subscriptions:

# hammer subscription list \

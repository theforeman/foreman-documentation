= Attaching Red Hat subscriptions to content hosts

Using activation keys is the main method to attach subscriptions to content hosts during the provisioning process.
However, an activation key cannot update an existing host.
If you need to attach new or additional subscriptions, such as future-dated subscriptions, to one host, use the following procedure.

For more information about updating multiple hosts, see xref:Updating_Red_Hat_Subscriptions_on_Multiple_Hosts_{context}[].

For more information about activation keys, see xref:Managing_Activation_Keys_{context}[].

.{Project} subscriptions
In {Project}, you must maintain a {RHEL} Satellite subscription, formerly known as {RHEL} Smart Management, for every {RHEL} host that you want to manage.

However, you are not required to attach {Project} subscriptions to each content host.
{Project} subscriptions cannot attach automatically to content hosts in {Project} because they are not associated with any product certificates.
Adding a {Project} subscription to a content host does not provide any content or repository access.
If you want, you can add a {Project} subscription to a manifest for your own recording or tracking purposes.

.Prerequisites
* You must have a Red{nbsp}Hat subscription manifest file imported to {ProjectServer}.
For more information, see xref:Importing_a_Red_Hat_Subscription_Manifest_into_Server_{context}[].

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, ensure the context is set to the organization you want to use.
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Hosts* > *Content Hosts*.
. On the row of each content host whose subscription you want to change, select the corresponding checkbox.

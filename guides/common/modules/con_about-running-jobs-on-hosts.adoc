= About Running Jobs on Hosts

You can run jobs on hosts remotely from {SmartProxies} using shell scripts or Ansible tasks and playbooks.
This is referred to as remote execution.

For custom Ansible roles that you create, or roles that you download, you must install the package containing the roles on the {SmartProxy} base operating system.
Before you can use Ansible roles, you must import the roles into {Project} from the {SmartProxy} where they are installed.

Communication occurs through {SmartProxyServer}, which means that {ProjectServer} does not require direct access to the target host, and can scale to manage many hosts.
For more information, see xref:transport-modes-for-remote-execution_{context}[].

{Project} uses ERB syntax job templates.

Several job templates for shell scripts and Ansible are included by default.
For more information, see {ManagingHostsDocURL}setting-up-job-templates_managing-hosts[Setting up Job Templates].

[NOTE]
====
Any {SmartProxyServer} base operating system is a client of {ProjectServer}'s internal {SmartProxy}, and therefore this section applies to any type of host connected to {ProjectServer}, including {SmartProxies}.
====

You can run jobs on multiple hosts at once, and you can use variables in your commands for more granular control over the jobs you run.
You can use host facts and parameters to populate the variable values.

In addition, you can specify custom values for templates when you run the command.

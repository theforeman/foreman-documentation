= Using an HTTP Proxy for all {Project} HTTP Requests

If your {ProjectServer} must remain behind a firewall that blocks HTTP and HTTPS, you can configure a proxy for communication with external systems, including compute resources.

Note that if you are using compute resources for provisioning, and you want to use a different HTTP proxy with the compute resources, the proxy that you set for all {Project} communication takes precedence over the proxies that you set for compute resources.

.Procedure

. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Administer*{nbsp}>{nbsp}*Settings*.
. In the *HTTP(S) proxy* row, select the adjacent *Value* column and enter the proxy URL.
. Click the tick icon to save your changes.

.CLI procedure

* Enter the following command:

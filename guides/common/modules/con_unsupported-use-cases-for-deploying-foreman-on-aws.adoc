= Use Cases that Do Not Work

In AWS, you cannot manage the DHCP.
Because of this, most of Kickstart and PXE provisioning models of {ProjectServer} are unusable.
This includes:

* PXE Provisioning
* Discovery and Discovery Rules
* ISO Provisioning methods.
** PXE-Less Discovery (iPXE)
** Per-host ISO
** Generic ISO
** Full-host ISO

= Best practices for activation keys

* Create an activation key for each use case.
This structures, modularizes, and simplifies content management on hosts.
* Use a naming convention for activation keys to indicate the content and lifecycle environment, for example, `{client-os-context}-webserver`.
* Automate activation key management by using a Hammer script or an {ansible-docs-url}[Ansible playbook].

= Registering Hosts by Using Global Registration
[[Registering_Hosts_{context}]]

You can register a host to {Project} by generating a `curl` command on {Project} and running this command on hosts.
This method uses two provisioning templates: *Global Registration* template and *Linux host_init_config default* template.
That gives you complete control over the host registration process.

You can also customize the default templates if you need greater flexibility.
For more information, see xref:Customizing_the_Registration_Templates_{context}[].

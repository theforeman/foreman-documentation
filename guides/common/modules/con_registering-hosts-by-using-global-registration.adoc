= Registering hosts by using global registration

[role="_abstract"]
You can register a host to {Project} by generating a `curl` or `wget` command on {Project} and running this command on hosts.
This method uses two provisioning templates: *Global Registration* template and *Linux host_init_config default* template.
That gives you complete control over the host registration process.

You can also customize the default templates if you need greater flexibility.
For more information, see xref:Customizing_the_Registration_Templates_{context}[].

If you use the Resource Quota plugin, registered hosts are automatically assigned to the `Unassigned` resource quota.
However, if you have the setting `Resource Quota optional assignment` set to `No` and no quotas to that a host can be assigned to, the host registration will fail because there is no valid quota the host can be assigned to.
For more information, see {AdministeringDocURL}limiting-host-resources[Limiting host resources] in _{AdministeringDocTitle}_.

You can extend registration options by plugins.

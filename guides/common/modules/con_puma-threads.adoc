= Puma Threads

Number of Puma threads (per Puma worker) is configured using two values: `threads_min` and `threads_max`.

Value of `threads_min` determines how many threads each worker spawns at a worker start.
Then, as concurrent requests are coming and more threads is needed, worker will be spawning more and more workers up to `threads_max` limit.

We recommend setting `threads_min` to same value as `threads_max` as having fewer Puma threads lead to higher memory usage on your {ProjectServer}.

For example, we have compared these two setups using concurrent registrations test:

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]

|{Project} VM with 8 CPUs, 40 GiB RAM |{Project} VM with 8 CPUs, 40 GiB RAM
|`--foreman-foreman-service-puma-threads-min=0` |`--foreman-foreman-service-puma-threads-min=16`
|`--foreman-foreman-service-puma-threads-max=16` |`--foreman-foreman-service-puma-threads-max=16`
|`--foreman-foreman-service-puma-workers=2` |`--foreman-foreman-service-puma-workers=2`
|===

Setting the minimum Puma threads to `16` results in about 12% less memory usage as compared to `threads_min=0`.

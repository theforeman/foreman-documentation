= Puma Threads

Fewer Puma threads lead to higher memory usage for different scales on your {ProjectServer}.

Value of `threads_min` determines how many threads each worker spawns at a worker start.
Then, as concurrent requests are coming and more threads is needed, worker will be spawning more and more workers up to `threads_max` limit.

We recommend setting `threads_min` to same value as `threads_max` as having fewer Puma threads lead to higher memory usage on your {ProjectServer}.

For example, we have compared these two setups using concurrent registrations test:

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|{Project} VM with 8 CPUs, 40 GiB RAM |{Project} VM with 8 CPUs, 40 GiB RAM
|`--foreman-foreman-service-puma-threads-min=0` |`--foreman-foreman-service-puma-threads-min=16`
|`--foreman-foreman-service-puma-threads-max=16` |`--foreman-foreman-service-puma-threads-max=16`
|`--foreman-foreman-service-puma-workers=2` |`--foreman-foreman-service-puma-workers=2`
|===

Setting the minimum Puma threads to `16` results in about 12% less memory as compared to `t_min=0`.

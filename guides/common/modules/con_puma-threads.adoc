To configure the number of Puma threads (per Puma worker), use these values: `threads_min` and `threads_max`.

Value of `threads_min` determines how many threads each worker spawns at a worker start.
Then, as concurrent requests are coming and more threads is needed, worker will be spawning more and more workers up to `threads_max` limit.

We recommend setting `threads_min` to same value as `threads_max` as having fewer Puma threads lead to higher memory usage on your {ProjectServer}.

For example, we have compared these two setups on a virtual machine with 8 CPUs and 40 GiB RAM using concurrent registrations test.
They both used `--foreman-foreman-service-puma-threads-max=16` and `--foreman-foreman-service-puma-workers=2`.
Setting the minimum Puma threads to `16` by using `--foreman-foreman-service-puma-threads-min=16` results in about 12% less memory usage as compared to `0`.

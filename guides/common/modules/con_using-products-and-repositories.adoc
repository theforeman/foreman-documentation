* The relationship between a product and its repositories is the same and the repositories still require synchronization.
* {customproduct}s require a subscription for clients to access, similar to subscriptions to Red Hat Products.
{Project} creates a subscription for each {customproduct} you create.

Red Hat Content is already organized into Products.
For example, {RHEL} Server is a _Product_ in {Project}.
The repositories for that Product consist of different versions, architectures, and add-ons.
For Red{nbsp}Hat repositories, products are created automatically after enabling the repository.
For more information, see xref:Enabling_Red_Hat_Repositories_{context}[].

Other {customcontent} can be organized into Products however you want.
For example, you might create an EPEL (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux) product and add an "EPEL 7 x86_64" repository to it.

ifdef::orcharhino[]
You can organize content in Products.
Products bundle an arbitrary number of repositories.

{customproduct}s require a subscription for clients to access.
{Project} creates a subscription for each {customproduct} you create.

* The relationship between a product and its repositories is the same and the repositories still require synchronization.
* {customproduct}s require a subscription for clients to access, similar to subscriptions to Red Hat Products.
{Project} creates a subscription for each {customproduct} you create.

Red Hat Content is already organized into Products.
For example, {RHEL} Server is a _Product_ in {Project}.
The repositories for that Product consist of different versions, architectures, and add-ons.
For Red{nbsp}Hat repositories, products are created automatically after enabling the repository.
See xref:Enabling_Red_Hat_Repositories[]

Other {customcontent} can be organized into Products however you want.
For example, you might create an EPEL (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux) product and add an "EPEL 7 x86_64" repository to it.

For more information about creating and packaging RPMs, see the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html-single/rpm_packaging_guide/[RPM Packaging Guide] in the Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise Linux documentation.

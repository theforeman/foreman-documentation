= Adding {RHEL} System Roles

{RHEL} System Roles is a configuration interface to remotely manage {RHEL} servers. You can use {RHEL} System Roles to add Ansible roles in {Project}. Using Ansible Roles in {Project} can make configuration faster and easier.

Support levels for some of the {RHEL} System Roles might be in Technology Preview. For up-to-date information about support levels and general information about {RHEL} System Roles, see https://access.redhat.com/articles/3050101[Red Hat Enterprise Linux System Roles].

The `rhel-system-roles` package downloads to `/usr/share/ansible/roles/`. You can view and make any modifications that you want to the files before you import.


. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Configure* > *Roles* and click the {SmartProxy} that contains the roles that you want to import.
. From the list of Ansible roles, select the check box of the roles you want to import, and then click *Update*.

You can now assign Ansible roles to hosts or host groups. For more information, see {BaseURL}managing_hosts/using_ansible_roles#assigning-ansible-roles-to-an-existing-host[Assigning Ansible Roles to an Existing Host] in the _Managing Hosts_ guide.

You can also add the modules contained in these roles to your Ansible playbooks by adding them to Ansible Job Templates. You must include the `hosts:all` line in the job template. For more information, see https://access.redhat.com/articles/3050101[Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) System Roles].

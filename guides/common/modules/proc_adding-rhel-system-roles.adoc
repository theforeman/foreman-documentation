The `rhel-system-roles` package downloads to `/usr/share/ansible/roles/`.
You can view and make any modifications that you want to the files before you import.
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Configure* > *Roles* and click the {SmartProxy} that contains the roles that you want to import.
. From the list of Ansible roles, select the checkbox of the roles you want to import, and then click *Update*.

You can now assign Ansible roles to hosts or host groups.
For more information, see xref:Assigning_Ansible_Roles_to_an_Existing_Host_{context}[].

You can also add the modules contained in these roles to your Ansible playbooks by adding them to Ansible Job Templates.
You must include the `hosts:all` line in the job template.

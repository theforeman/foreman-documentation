= Prerequisites for VMware provisioning

[role="_abstract"] 
Before you can deploy virtual machines in {Project} by using VMware vSphere, ensure that your environment meets the following requirements.

The requirements for VMware vSphere provisioning include:

* A supported version of VMware vCenter Server.
The following versions have been fully tested with {Project}:
** vCenter Server 8.0
** vCenter Server 7.0
* A {SmartProxyServer} managing a network on the vSphere environment.
Ensure no other DHCP services run on this network to avoid conflicts with {SmartProxyServer}.

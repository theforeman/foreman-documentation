= Prerequisites for VMware Provisioning

The requirements for VMware vSphere provisioning include:

* A {SmartProxyServer} managing a network on the vSphere environment.
Ensure no other DHCP services run on this network to avoid conflicts with {SmartProxyServer}.
For more information, see xref:Configuring_Networking_{context}[].
* An existing VMware template if you want to use image-based provisioning.

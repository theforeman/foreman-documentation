The following versions have been fully tested with {Project}:
** vCenter Server 8.0
** vCenter Server 7.0
** vCenter Server 6.7 (EOL)
** vCenter Server 6.5 (EOL)
* A {SmartProxyServer} managing a network on the vSphere environment.
Ensure no other DHCP services run on this network to avoid conflicts with {SmartProxyServer}.

= Inspecting Available Errata

The following procedure describes how to view and filter the available errata and how to display metadata of the selected advisory.
To use the CLI instead of the {ProjectWebUI}, see the xref:cli-inspecting-available-errata[].

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Content* > *Errata* to view the list of available errata.
. Use the filtering tools at the top of the page to limit the number of displayed errata:
+
* Select the repository to be inspected from the list.
*All Repositories* is selected by default.
* The *Applicable* check box is selected by default to view only applicable errata in the selected repository.
Select the *Installable* check box to view only errata marked as installable.
* To search the table of errata, type the query in the *Search* field in the form of:
+
[subs="+quotes"]
----
__parameter operator value__
----
+
See xref:Parameters_Available_for_Errata_Search_{context}[] for the list of parameters available for search.
Find the list of applicable operators in {AdministeringDocURL}Supported_Operators_for_Granular_Search_admin[Supported Operators for Granular Search] in _Administering {ProjectName}_.
Automatic suggestion works as you type.
You can also combine queries with the use of *and* and *or* operators.
For example, to display only security advisories related to the *kernel* package, type:
+
----
type = security and package_name = kernel
----
+
Press *Enter* to start the search.
. Click the *Errata ID* of the erratum you want to inspect:
+
* The *Details* tab contains the description of the updated package as well as documentation of important fixes and enhancements provided by the update.
* On the *Content Hosts* tab, you can apply the erratum to selected content hosts as described in xref:Applying_Errata_to_Multiple_Hosts_{context}[].
* The *Repositories* tab lists repositories that already contain the erratum.
You can filter repositories by the environment and Content View, and search for them by the repository name.

You can also use the new Host page to view to inspect available errata and select errata to install.

. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Hosts > All Hosts* and select the host you require.
. If there are errata associated with the host they are displayed in an Installable Errata card on the new Host page.
. On the new Host page, select the *Content* tab.
. On the Content page select the *Errata* tab.
. The page displays installable errata for the chosen host.
. Click the checkbox for any errata you wish to install.
. Using the three dots icon of the errata you want to add to the host, select *Apply via Katello agent* if you have no connectivity to the target host using SSH.
. Select *Apply via Remote Execution* to use Remote Execution, or *Apply via customized remote execution* if you want to customize the remote execution.
. Click *Submit*.

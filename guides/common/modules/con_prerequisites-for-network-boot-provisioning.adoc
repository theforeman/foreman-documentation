= Prerequisites for network-boot provisioning

The requirements for network-boot provisioning include:

* Provisioning infrastructure services (DNS, DHCP, TFTP) are integrated with {Project} and configured for PXE provisioning.
ifndef::satellite[]
* Provisioning templates are associated with a client operating system.
+
For BIOS provisioning, you must associate a PXELinux template with the operating system.
For UEFI provisioning, you must associate a PXEGrub2 template with the operating system.
If you associate both PXELinux and PXEGrub2 templates, {Project} deploys configuration files for both on a TFTP server, so that you can switch between PXE loaders easily.
+
For more information, see xref:associating-templates-with-operating-systems[].

* A bare-metal host or a blank virtual machine.

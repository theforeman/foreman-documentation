= Prerequisites for network-boot provisioning

[role="_abstract"]
Before you can use the automated PXE or UEFI HTTP provisioning methods, ensure that your environment meets the following requirements.

The requirements for network-boot provisioning include:

* Provisioning infrastructure services (DNS, DHCP, TFTP) are integrated with {Project} and configured.
ifndef::satellite[]
* Provisioning templates are associated with a client operating system.
+
For BIOS provisioning, you must associate a PXELinux template with the operating system.
For UEFI provisioning, you must associate a PXEGrub2 template with the operating system.
If you associate both PXELinux and PXEGrub2 templates, {Project} deploys configuration files for both on a TFTP server, so that you can switch between PXE loaders easily.
endif::[]
* A bare-metal machine or a blank virtual machine.
The provisioned machine must appear on the same network as your provisioning infrastructure services.
+
You can integrate a compute resource with {Project} and let the compute resource create virtual machines through this integration.
You can also provision virtual machines from unintegrated infrastructure as you would bare-metal machines.

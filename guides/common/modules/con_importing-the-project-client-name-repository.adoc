= Importing the {project-client-name} repository

The {project-client-name} repository provides client integration tools, such as `katello-host-tools` or `puppet-agent` packages, for hosts registered to {Project}.
You must enable the repository, synchronize the repository from the Red Hat Content Delivery Network (CDN) to your {ProjectServer}, and enable the repository on your hosts.

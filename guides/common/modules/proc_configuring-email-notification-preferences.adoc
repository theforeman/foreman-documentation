= Configuring Email Notification Preferences

You can configure {Project} to send email messages to individual users registered to {Project}.
{Project} sends the email to the email address that has been added to the account, if present.
Users can edit the email address by clicking on their name in the top-right of the {ProjectWebUI} and selecting **My account**.

Configure email notifications for a user from the {ProjectWebUI}.

[NOTE]

If you want to send email notifications to a group email address instead of an individual email address, create a user account with the group email address and minimal {Project} permissions, then subscribe the user account to the desired notification types.

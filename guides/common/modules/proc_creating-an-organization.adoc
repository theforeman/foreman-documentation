# hammer organization create \
--name "_My_Organization_" \

[NOTE]
====

If you wish to disable SCA, add the `--simple-content-access false` parameter to the command.
{Team} does not advise you to disable SCA because entitlement mode (not using SCA) is deprecated.

For example, the following command assigns a compute resource to the organization:

# hammer organization update \

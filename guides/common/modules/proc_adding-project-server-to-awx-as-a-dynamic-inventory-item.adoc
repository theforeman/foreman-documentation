= Adding {ProjectServer} to {awx} as a dynamic inventory item

To add {ProjectServer} to {awx} as a dynamic inventory item, you must create a credential for a {ProjectServer} user on {awx}, add an {awx} user to the credential, and then configure an inventory source.

.Prerequisites
* If your {Project} deployment is large, for example, managing tens of thousands of hosts, using a non-admin user can negatively impact performance because of time penalties that accrue during authorization checks.
For large deployments, consider using an admin user.
* For non-admin users, you must assign the `Ansible Tower Inventory Reader` role to your {ProjectServer} user.
For more information about managing users, roles, and permission filters, see {AdministeringDocURL}creating-and-managing-roles[Creating and managing roles] in _{AdministeringDocTitle}_.
* You must host your {ProjectServer} and {awx} on the same network or subnet.

.Procedure
. In the {awx} web UI, create a credential for your {Project}.

If you have the *Show new host overview page* setting enabled, the new UI appears by default.
If you do not have the setting enabled, the classic UI appears by default and you must click the *New UI* button.

. Click *Manage columns*.
. Under *Content*, click the *Content view environments* checkbox and click *Save*.

If you reassign the content view environments of a multi-environment host from the *Content view environments* card, the host's content view environments are overwritten and it is no longer a multi-environment host.

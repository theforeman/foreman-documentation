Each provisioning type requires some network configuration.
Use this chapter to configure network services on your {SmartProxies}.

New hosts must have access to either your {ProjectServer} or any {SmartProxyServer}.
If your hosts are on isolated networks and cannot connect to {ProjectServer} directly, you must provision your hosts from {SmartProxyServers}.
Provisioning by using {SmartProxyServers} can save on network bandwidth.

Configuring {SmartProxies} has two basic requirements:

. Configuring network services.
This includes:

** Content delivery services
endif::[]
** Network services (DHCP, DNS, and TFTP)
** Puppet configuration
. Defining network resource data in {ProjectServer} to help configure network interfaces on new hosts.

The following instructions have similar applications to configuring {SmartProxyServers} managing a specific network.

To configure {Project} to use external DHCP, DNS, and TFTP services, see {InstallingServerDocURL}configuring-external-services[Configuring External Services] in _{InstallingServerDocTitle}_.

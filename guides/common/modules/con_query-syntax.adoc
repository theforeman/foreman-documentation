Available fields, resources to search, and the way the query is interpreted all depend on context, that is, the page where you perform the search.
For example, the field "hostgroup" on the Hosts page is equivalent to the field "name" on the Host Groups page.
The field type also determines available operators and accepted values.

For a list of all operators, see xref:Query_Operators_{context}[Operators].
For descriptions of value formats, see xref:Query_Values_{context}[Values].

= Host group structures

The fact that host groups can be nested to inherit parameters from each other allows for designing host group hierarchies that fit particular workflows.
A well planned host group structure can help to simplify the maintenance of host settings.
This section outlines four approaches to organizing host groups.

Flat structure::
The advantage of a flat structure is limited complexity, as inheritance is avoided.
In a deployment with few host types, this scenario is the best option.
However, without inheritance there is a risk of high duplication of settings between host groups.

Lifecycle environment based structure::
In this hierarchy, the first host group level is reserved for parameters specific to a lifecycle environment.
The second level contains operating system related definitions, and the third level contains application specific settings.
Such structure is useful in scenarios where responsibilities are divided among lifecycle environments (for example, a dedicated owner for the *Development*, *QA*, and *Production* lifecycle stages).

Application based structure::
This hierarchy is based on roles of hosts in a specific application.
For example, it enables defining network settings for groups of back-end and front-end servers.
The selected characteristics of hosts are segregated, which supports Puppet-focused management of complex configurations.
However, the content views can only be assigned to host groups at the bottom level of this hierarchy.

Location based structure::
In this hierarchy, the distribution of locations is aligned with the host group structure.
In a scenario where the location ({SmartProxyServer}) topology determines many other attributes, this approach is the best option.
On the other hand, this structure complicates sharing parameters across locations, therefore in complex environments with a large number of applications, the number of host group changes required for each configuration change increases significantly.

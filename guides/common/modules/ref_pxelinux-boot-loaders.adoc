= PXELinux boot loaders

[role="_abstract"]
*PXELinux* is a Syslinux-based PXE boot loader used by {Project} for BIOS and UEFI systems.
In {Project}, PXELinux enables hosts to boot into the OS installer automatically during provisioning.
When a host is set to *Build mode*, {Project} generates a host-specific configuration file and places it in the TFTP directory managed by the {SmartProxy}.

[NOTE]
====
When a host is set to *Build mode*, {Project} automatically generates the configuration file under `pxelinux.cfg/` based on the host’s OS, architecture, and installation template. 
The {SmartProxy}’s TFTP service then serves both the PXELinux binary and its configuration file to the client during network boot.

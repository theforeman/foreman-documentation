= Renaming {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServerTitle}

To rename {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer}, you must use the `{project-change-hostname}` script.

If you rename {ProjectServer}, you must reregister all {Project} clients and configure each {SmartProxyServer} to point them to the new {Project} host name.
If you use custom SSL certificates, you must regenerate them with the new host name.
If you use virt-who, you must update the virt-who configuration files with the new host name.

If you rename {SmartProxyServer}, you must reregister all {SmartProxy} clients and update the {SmartProxy} host name in the {ProjectWebUI}.
If you use custom SSL certificates, you must regenerate them with the new host name.

[WARNING]
====
The renaming process shuts down all {ProjectServer} services on the host being renamed.
When the renaming is complete, all services are restarted.

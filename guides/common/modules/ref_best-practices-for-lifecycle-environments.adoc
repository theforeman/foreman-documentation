= Best practices for lifecycle environments

* Use multiple lifecycle environment paths to implement multiple sequential stages of content consumption.
Each stage contains a defined set of content, for example in the _Production_ lifecycle environment.
* Automate the creation of lifecycle environments by using a Hammer script or an {ansible-docs-url}[Ansible playbook].
* Default use case: Fixed stages in each lifecycle environment paths, for example _Development_, _Test_, and _Production_.
** Promote content views to lifecycle environments, for example, from _Test_ to _Production_.
All content hosts consuming this content view or composite content view are able to install packages from the _Production_ lifecycle environment.
Note that these packages are not installed or updated automatically.
** If you encounter errors during patching content hosts, attach the host to a previous version of the content view.
This only affects the availability of packages but does not downgrade installed packages.
* Alternative use case: Using stages in lifecycle environments for fixed content, for example, quarterly updates, and only publishing new minor versions with incremental updates from errata.
** When patching content hosts, change the lifecycle environment from `2023-Q4` to `2024-Q1` using the {ProjectWebUI}, {Project} API, Hammer CLI, or an activation key.
** Advantage: You can directly see which software packages a hosts receives by looking at its lifecycle environment.
** Disadvantage: Promoting content is less dynamic without clearly defined stages such as _Development_, _Test_, and _Production_.
* Use multiple lifecycle environment paths to define multiple stages for different environments, for example to decouple web server and database hosts.
* {SmartProxyServers} use lifecycle environments to synchronize content.
They synchronize content more efficiently if you split content into multiple lifecycle environment paths.
If a specific {SmartProxyServer} only serves content for one operating system in a single lifecycle environment path, it only synchronizes required content.

[id="Performing_a_Full_Backup_{context}"]
= Performing a full backup of {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer}

{ProjectName} uses the `{foreman-maintain} backup` command to make backups.

There are two main methods of backing up {ProjectServer}:

* Offline backup
+
All {Project} services are shut down during an offline backup.

* Online backup
+
Only {Project} services that affect the consistency of the backup are shut down while the backup process is running.
Online backups check for consistency and require more time than offline backups. 

For more information about each of these methods, you can view the usage statements for each backup method.

.Directory creation
The `{foreman-maintain} backup` command creates a time-stamped subdirectory in the backup directory that you specify.
The `{foreman-maintain} backup` command does not overwrite backups, therefore you must select the correct directory or subdirectory when restoring from a backup or an incremental backup.
The `{foreman-maintain} backup` command stops and restarts services as required.

When you run the `{foreman-maintain} backup offline` command, the following default backup directories are created:

* `{project-context}-backup` on {Project}
* `foreman-proxy-backup` on {SmartProxy}

If you want to set a custom directory name, add the `--preserve-directory` option and add a directory name.
The backup is then stored in the directory you provide in the command line.
If you use the `--preserve-directory` option, no data is removed if the backup fails.

Note that if you use a local PostgreSQL database, the `postgres` user requires write access to the backup directory.

.Remote databases
You can use the `{foreman-maintain} backup` command to back up remote databases.

You can use both online and offline methods to back up remote databases, but if you use offline method, the `{foreman-maintain} backup` command performs a database dump.

.Backing up to a remote NFS share
To enable {Project} to save the backup to an NFS share, ensure that the `root` user of your {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer} can write to the NFS share.
NFS export options such as `root_squash` and `all_squash` are known to prevent this.

.Prerequisites
* Ensure that your backup location has sufficient available disk space to store the backup.

[WARNING]
====
Request other users of {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer} to save any changes and warn them that {Project} services are unavailable for the duration of the backup.
Ensure no other tasks are scheduled for the same time as the backup.

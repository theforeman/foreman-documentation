= Creating a Shellhook to Print Arguments

Create a simple shellhook script that prints "Hello World!" when you run a remote execution job.

.Prerequisite
* You have the `webhooks` and `shellhooks` plug-ins installed.
For more information, see:

** xref:installing-webhooks-plugin_{context}[]
** xref:installing-shellhooks-plugin_{context}[]

.Procedure
. Modify the `/var/lib/foreman-proxy/shellhooks/print_args` script to print arguments to standard error output so you can see them in the {SmartProxy} logs:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
#!/bin/sh
#
# Prints all arguments to stderr
#
echo "$@" >&2
----
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Administer* > *Webhooks*.
. Click *Create new*.
. From the *Subscribe to* list, select *Actions Remote Execution Run Host Job Succeeded*.
. Enter a *Name* for your webhook.
. In the *Target URL* field, enter the URL of your {SmartProxyServer} followed by `:{smartproxy_port}/shellhook/print_args`:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
https://_{smartproxy-example-com}_:{smartproxy_port}/shellhook/print_args
----
+
Note that `shellhook` in the URL is singular, unlike the `shellhooks` directory.
. From the *Template* list, select *Empty Payload*.
. On the *Credentials* tab, check *{SmartProxy} Authorization*.
. On the *Additional* tab, enter the following text in the *Optional HTTP headers* field:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
{
    "X-Shellhook-Arg-1": "Hello",
    "X-Shellhook-Arg-2": "World!"
}
----
. Click *Submit*.
You now have successfully created a shellhook that prints "Hello World!" to {SmartProxy} logs every time you a remote execution job succeeds.

.Verification
. Run a remote execution job on any host.
You can use `time` as a command.
For more information, see {ManagingHostsDocURL}executing-a-remote-job_managing-hosts[Executing a Remote Job] in _{ManagingHostsDocTitle}_.
. Verify that the shellhook script was triggered and printed "Hello World!" to {SmartProxyServer} logs:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# tail /var/log/foreman-proxy/proxy.log
----
+
You should find the following lines at the end of the log:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----

[I] Finished POST /shellhook/print_args with 200 (0.33 ms)

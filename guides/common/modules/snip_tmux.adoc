Because of the lengthy upgrade time, use a utility such as `tmux` to suspend and reattach a communication session.
You can then check the upgrade progress without staying connected to the command shell continuously.
For more information, see the `tmux` manual page.

If you lose connection to the command shell where the upgrade command is running you can see the logged messages in the `{installer-log-file}` file to check if the process completed successfully.

= Assigning content view environments to an activation key by using CLI

[role="_abstract"]
You can assign multiple content view environments to an activation key to provide hosts with access to content from each assigned environment.
Hosts registered with the activation key receive the environments in the order they are stored.
For more information, see xref:content-view-environment-ordering-and-priority[].

[NOTE]
====
You cannot reassign a multi-environment activation key's content view environments using the {ProjectWebUI}.
To change content view environments, update the activation key with Hammer CLI.

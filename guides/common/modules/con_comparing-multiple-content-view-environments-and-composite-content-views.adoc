= Comparing multiple content view environments and composite content views

Composite content views provide an alternative method for granting hosts access to content from multiple content views.
You can use composite content views, multiple content view environments, or a combination of both.
The key differences between these methods include the following:

Access Timing::
Hosts assigned to composite content views gain access to the combined content only after you publish the composite content view.
Hosts assigned to multiple content view environments immediately access the combined content from all assigned environments.

Conflict Resolution::
Composite content views resolve conflicts at the time of publishing by merging duplicate repositories.
For hosts assigned to multiple content view environments, repository conflicts are resolved based on the order of content view environments.
For more information about content view environment ordering and priority, see xref:content-view-environment-ordering-and-priority[].

Version Selection::
Composite content views allow you to select specific versions of a content view, including older versions.
With multiple content view environments, the host always receives the latest version of the content view with no option to select a different version.

Choose the approach that best suits your requirements based on these differences.

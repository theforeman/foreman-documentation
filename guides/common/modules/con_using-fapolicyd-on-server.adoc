By enabling `fapolicyd` on your {ProjectServer}, you can provide an additional layer of security by monitoring and controlling access to files and directories.
The fapolicyd daemon uses the RPM database as a repository of trusted binaries and scripts.

You can turn on or off the fapolicyd on your {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer} at any point.

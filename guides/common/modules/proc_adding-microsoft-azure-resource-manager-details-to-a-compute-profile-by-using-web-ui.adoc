= Adding Microsoft Azure Resource Manager details to a compute profile by using {ProjectWebUI}

[role="_abstract"]
To standardize and more efficiently manage the deployment of your cloud instances in the Azure cloud, add Microsoft Azure hardware settings to a compute profile.
When you create a host on Microsoft Azure using this compute profile, these settings are automatically populated.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Infrastructure* > *Compute Profiles*.
. In the Compute Profiles window, click the name of an existing compute profile, or click *Create Compute Profile*, enter a *Name*, and click *Submit*.
. Click the name of the Azure compute resource.
. From the *Resource group* list, select the resource group to provision to.
. From the *VM Size* list, select a size of a virtual machine to provision.
. From the *Platform* list, select *Linux*.
. In the *Username* field, enter a user name to authenticate with.
Note that the username that you enter for compute profile must be the same that you use when creating an image.
. To authenticate the user, use one of the following options:
* To authenticate using a password, enter a password in the *Password* field.
* To authenticate using an SSH key, enter an SSH key in the *SSH Key* field.
. Optional: If you want the virtual machine to use a premium virtual machine disk, select the *Premium OS Disk* checkbox.
. From the *OS Disk Caching* list, select the disc caching setting.
. Optional: In the *Custom Script Command* field, enter commands to perform on the virtual machine when the virtual machine is provisioned.
. Optional: If you want to run custom scripts when provisioning finishes, in the *Comma separated file URIs* field, enter comma-separated file URIs of scripts to use.
The scripts must contain `sudo` at the beginning because {ProjectName} downloads files to the `/var/lib/waagent/custom-script/download/0/` directory on the host and scripts require sudo privileges to be executed.
. Optional: You can add a *NVIDIA Driver* by selecting the *NVIDIA driver / CUDA* checkbox.
For more information, refer to the following Microsoft Azure documentation:
  ** https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/extensions/hpccompute-gpu-linux[NVIDIA GPU Driver Extension for Linux]
  ** https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/extensions/hpccompute-gpu-windows[NVIDIA GPU Driver Extension for Windows]
. Optional: If you want to create an additional volume on the VM, click the *Add Volume* button, enter the *Size* in GB and select the *Data Disk Caching* method.
  ** Note that the maximum number of these disks depends on the VM Size selected.
For more information on Microsoft Azure VM storage requirements, see the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines[Microsoft Azure documentation].
. Click *Add Interface*.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The maximum number of interfaces depends on the VM Size selected.
For more information, see the Microsoft Azure documentation link above.
====
. From the *Azure Subnet* list, select the Azure subnet to provision to.
. From the *Public IP* list, select the public IP setting.
. Optional: If you want the virtual machine to use a static private IP, select the *Static Private IP* checkbox.
. Click *Submit*.

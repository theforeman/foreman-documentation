= Creating Custom {RHEL} Images

.Prerequisites
* Use a Linux host machine to create an image.
In this example, we use a {RHEL} 7 Workstation.
* Use `virt-manager` on your workstation to complete this procedure.
If you create the image on a remote server, connect to the server from your workstation with `virt-manager`.
* A {RHEL} 7 or 6 ISO file (see https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/69/ver=/rhel---7/7.4/x86_64/product-software[{RHEL} 7.4 Binary DVD] or https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/69/ver=/rhel---6/6.9/x86_64/product-software[{RHEL} 6.9 Binary DVD]).

For more information about installing a {RHEL} Workstation, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html-single/installation_guide/[{RHEL} 7 Installation Guide].

Before you can create custom images, install the following packages:

* Install `libvirt`, `qemu-kvm`, and graphical tools:

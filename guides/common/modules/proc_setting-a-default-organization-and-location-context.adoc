= Setting a default organization and location context

Many `hammer` commands are organization specific.
You can set a default organization and location for `hammer` commands so that you do not have to specify them every time with the `--organization` and `--location` options.

Specifying a default organization is useful when you mostly manage a single organization, as it makes your commands shorter.
However, when you switch to a different organization, you must use `hammer` with the `--organization` option to specify it.

.Procedure
. Set a default organization:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# hammer defaults add --param-name organization \
--param-value _"Your_Organization"_
----
+
You can find the name of your organization with the `hammer organization list` command.
. Optional: Set a default location:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# hammer defaults add --param-name location \
--param-value _"Your_Location"_
----
+
You can find the name of your location with the `hammer location list` command.

.Verification
. Review the currently specified default settings:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
# hammer defaults list
----

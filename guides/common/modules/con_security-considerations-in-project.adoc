[id="security-considerations-in-project"]
= Security considerations in {Project}

{Project} supports multiple security mechanisms to provide additional layers of protection.
Implementing these security features enhances the overall security of your {Project} deployment.

[NOTE]
====
These security considerations apply to both {ProjectServer} and {SmartProxyServer} environments.
====

Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) Mode::
{Project} supports running on FIPS-enabled {RHEL} hosts to comply with security standards for cryptographic modules. 
However, {Project} itself is not FIPS-certified.
In addition, you cannot enable FIPS mode after the installation of {Project}.
+
FIPS mode enforces the use of validated cryptographic algorithms and modules.
Enabling FIPS mode ensures that all cryptographic operations within the system adhere to strict security standards.
+
For more information, see {RHELDocsBaseURL}9/html/security_hardening/switching-rhel-to-fips-mode_security-hardening[Switching RHEL to FIPS mode] in _{RHEL}{nbsp}9 Security hardening_.
+
[NOTE]
====
{Project} supports DEFAULT and FIPS crypto-policies.
The FUTURE crypto-policy is not supported for {ProjectServer} and {SmartProxyServer} installations.
The FUTURE policy is a stricter forward-looking security level intended for testing a possible future policy.
For more information, see {RHELDocsBaseURL}9/html/security_hardening/using-the-system-wide-cryptographic-policies_security-hardening[Using system-wide cryptographic policies] in _{RHEL}{nbsp}9 Security hardening_.
====

File Access Policy Daemon (`fapolicyd`)::
By enabling `fapolicyd` on your {ProjectServer}, you can monitor and control file and directory access, which provides an additional security layer.
+
This feature helps prevent unauthorized code execution and enhances system integrity.
You can enable or disable `fapolicyd` on both {ProjectServer} and {SmartProxyServer} at any time, depending on your security requirements.
+
For additional information about `fapolicyd`, including instructions on enabling it, see {RHELDocsBaseURL}9/html/security_hardening/assembly_blocking-and-allowing-applications-using-fapolicyd_security-hardening[Blocking and allowing applications by using fapolicyd] in _{RHEL}{nbsp}9 Security hardening_.

Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)::
{Team} does not support PQC compatibility for {Project}.

Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux)::
{Project} requires SELinux, a mandatory access control system that restricts system access and reduces the risk of security vulnerabilities.
SELinux enforces policies that define which processes can access specific system resources, providing protection against unauthorized access and exploitation.
+
To maintain a high-security environment, {Team} recommends running {Project} with SELinux in enforcing mode.
It ensures that access control policies are strictly enforced, minimizing the risk of privilege escalation or unauthorized actions.

Additional Security Recommendations::
Regularly updating security policies and configurations, as well as monitoring system logs and security policies, can help detect and respond to potential threats effectively.

Security compliance::
For certain use cases, your {ProjectServer} must meet the requirements of security compliance.
You can use Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) to scan your system for security policy compliance.

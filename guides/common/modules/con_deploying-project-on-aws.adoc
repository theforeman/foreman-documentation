= Deploying {Project} on AWS

[role="_abstract"]
You can deploy {ProjectServer}, {SmartProxyServers}, and hosts in Amazon Web Services (AWS) using various configurations.
Options range from simple single-region setups to multi-region deployments with VPN connections or direct connections between on-premises and cloud environments.

You can run {ProjectServer}, {SmartProxyServers}, and hosts in your Amazon Web Services (AWS) environment.
You can deploy {Project} on Amazon Web Services (AWS) in several scenarios.

One-region setup::
This is the least complex configuration of {Project} in AWS.
Deploy both {ProjectServer} and the hosts residing within the same region and within the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
You can also use a different availability zone.

Connecting on-premises and AWS region::
Create a VPN connection between the on-premises location and the AWS region where your {SmartProxyServer} is located.
It is also possible to use the external host name of {ProjectServer} when you register the instance that runs {SmartProxy}.

.Site-to-site VPN connection between the AWS region and the on-premises data center

endif::[]

Connecting different regions::
Create a site-to-site VPN connection between different regions so that you can use the internal DNS host name when you register the instance that runs {SmartProxy} to {ProjectServer}.
If you do not establish a site-to-site VPN connection, use the external DNS host name when you register the instance that runs {SmartProxy} to {ProjectServer}.

[NOTE]
====
Most public cloud providers do not charge for data being transferred into a region or between availability zones within a single region.
However, they charge for data leaving the region to the Internet.

= Adding a Bonded Interface

Use this procedure to configure a bonded interface for a host.
To use the CLI instead of the {ProjectWebUI}, see the xref:cli-adding-a-bonded-interface_{context}[].

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Hosts* > *All hosts*.
. Click *Edit* next to the host you want to edit.
. On the *Interfaces* tab, click *Add Interface*.
. Select *Bond* from the *Type* list.
Additional type-specific configuration options are appended to the form.
. Specify the general interface settings.
The applicable configuration options are the same as for the physical interfaces described in xref:Adding_a_Physical_Interface_{context}[].
+
Bonded interfaces use IDs in the form of *bond0* in the *Device Identifier* field.
+
A single *MAC address* is sufficient.
. Specify the configuration options specific to bonded interfaces:

* *Mode*: Select the bonding mode that defines a policy for fault tolerance and load balancing.
See xref:Bonding_Modes_Available_{context}[] for a brief description of each bonding mode.

* *Attached devices*: Specify a comma-separated list of identifiers of attached devices.
These can be physical interfaces or VLANs.

* *Bond options*: Specify a space-separated list of configuration options, for example *miimon=100*.

See the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/networking_guide/index[{RHEL} 7 Networking Guide] for details of the configuration options you can specify for the bonded interface.
endif::[]

. Click *OK* to save the interface configuration.
. Click *Submit* to apply the changes to the host.

.Bonding Modes Available in {Project}
[options="header"]
|====
|Bonding Mode |Description
| balance-rr | Transmissions are received and sent sequentially on each bonded interface.
| active-backup | Transmissions are received and sent through the first available bonded interface.
Another bonded interface is only used if the active bonded interface fails.
| balance-xor | Transmissions are based on the selected hash policy.
In this mode, traffic destined for specific peers is always sent over the same interface.
| broadcast | All transmissions are sent on all bonded interfaces.
| 802.a3 | Creates aggregation groups that share the same settings.
Transmits and receives on all interfaces in the active group.
| balance-tlb | The outgoing traffic is distributed according to the current load on each bonded interface.
| balance-alb | Receive load balancing is achieved through Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) negotiation.

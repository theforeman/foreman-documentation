= Incremental Exports

Exporting Library content can be a very expensive operation in terms of space and resources. Organization that have multiple RHEL trees may occupy several gigabytes of the space on {ProjectServer}.

{ProjectServer} offers *Incremental Export* to help with this scenario.
*Incremental Export* exports only things that changed from the previous export.
These would be typically smaller than the full exports.
In the example below we will incrementally export what changed from the previous export of all the repositories in the Library lifecycle environment.

. Since nothing changed between the previous export and now in the Organization's library environment the change files are really small.

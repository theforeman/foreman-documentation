There are different ways of using ISS to synchronize content between two {ProjectServer}s.

.Connected
In a connected scenario, two {ProjectServer}s are able to communicate with each other.

.Disconnected
In a disconnected scenario, there is the following setup:

* Two {ProjectServer}s are connected to each other.
* One {ProjectServer} is connected to the Internet while the other {ProjectServer} is not connected to the Internet.
This is referred to as the disconnected {ProjectServer}.
* The disconnected {ProjectServer} is completely isolated from all external networks but can communicate with a connected {ProjectServer}.

.Air-gapped Disconnected
In this setup, both {ProjectServer}s are isolated from each other.
The only way for air-gapped {ProjectServer}s to receive content updates is through the import/export workflow.

= Managing external user groups

[role="_abstract"]
When using external authentication sources, such as {FreeIPA} or Active{nbsp}Directory, you can configure group membership to control user access and permissions in {Project}.
You might need to take extra configuration steps to manage group membership for user accounts defined in external authentication sources.

[NOTE]
====
External user groups based on {FreeIPA} or AD are refreshed only when a group member logs in to {Project}.
It is not possible to alter user membership of external user groups in the {ProjectWebUI}, such changes are overwritten on the next group refresh.

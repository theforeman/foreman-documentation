= Synchronizing the System Clock With chronyd

To minimize the effects of time drift, you must synchronize the system clock on the base operating system on which you want to install {ProductName} with Network Time Protocol (NTP) servers.
If the base operating system clock is configured incorrectly, certificate verification might fail.

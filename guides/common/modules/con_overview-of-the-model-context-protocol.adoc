= Overview of the Model Context Protocol

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open protocol that standardizes how AI applications integrate with data sources.

An MCP server connects to a data source.
An MCP-compatible AI application acts as an MCP client and connects to one or more MCP servers.
This enables the AI application to seamlessly work with the data source available through the MCP server.

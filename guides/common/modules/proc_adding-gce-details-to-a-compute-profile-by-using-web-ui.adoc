= Adding GCE details to a compute profile by using {ProjectWebUI}

[role="_abstract"]
You can add Google Compute Engine (GCE) hardware settings to a compute profile.
When you create a host on GCE using this compute profile, these settings are automatically populated.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Infrastructure* > *Compute Profiles*.
. In the Compute Profiles window, click the name of an existing compute profile, or click *Create Compute Profile*, enter a *Name*, and click *Submit*.
. Click the name of the GCE compute resource.
. From the *Machine Type* list, select the machine type to use for provisioning.
. From the *Image* list, select the image to use for provisioning.
. From the *Network* list, select the GCE network to use for provisioning.
. Optional: Select the *Associate Ephemeral External IP* checkbox to assign a dynamic ephemeral IP address that {Project} uses to communicate with the host.
This public IP address changes when you reboot the host.
If you need a permanent IP address, reserve a static public IP address on GCE and attach it to the host.
. In the *Size (GB)* field, enter the size of the storage to create on the host.
. Click *Submit* to save the compute profile.

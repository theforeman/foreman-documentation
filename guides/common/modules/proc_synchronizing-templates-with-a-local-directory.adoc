= Synchronizing Templates with a Local Directory

Synchronizing templates with a local directory is useful if you have configured a version control repository in the local directory.
That way, you can edit templates and track the history of edits in the directory.
You can also synchronize changes to {ProjectServer} after editing the templates.

.Prerequisites
* Each template must contain the location and organization that the template belongs to.
This applies to all template types.
Before you import a template, ensure that you add the following section to the template:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
<%#
kind: provision
name: _My_Provisioning_Template_
oses:
- _My_first_OS_
- _My_second_OS_
locations:
- _My_first_Location_
- _My_second_Location_
organizations:
- _My_first_Organization_
- _My_second_Organization_
%>
----

.Procedure
. In `/var/lib/foreman`, create a directory for storing templates:
+
[subs="+quotes"]
----
# mkdir /var/lib/foreman/_My_Templates_Dir_
----
+
[NOTE]
====
You can place your templates to a custom directory outside `/var/lib/foreman`, but you have to ensure that the `Foreman` service can read its contents.
The directory must have the correct file permissions and the `foreman_lib_t` SELinux label.
====
. Change the owner of the new templates directory to the `foreman` user:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
# chown foreman /var/lib/foreman/_My_Templates_Dir_
----
. Change the *Repo* setting on the *TemplateSync* tab to match the `/var/lib/foreman/_My_Templates_Dir_/` directory.

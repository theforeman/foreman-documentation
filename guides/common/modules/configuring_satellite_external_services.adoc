[[configuring_satellite_external_services]]

Some environments have existing DNS, DHCP, and TFTP services and do not need to use the Satellite Server to provide these services. If you want to use external servers to provide DNS, DHCP, or TFTP, you can configure them for use with Satellite Server.

If you want to disable these services in Satellite in order to manage them manually, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_satellite/{ProductVersion}/html/installing_satellite_server_from_a_connected_network/performing_additional_configuration_on_satellite_server#disabling_dns_dhcp_tftp_for_unmanaged_networks[Disabling DNS, DHCP, and TFTP for Unmanaged Networks] for more information.

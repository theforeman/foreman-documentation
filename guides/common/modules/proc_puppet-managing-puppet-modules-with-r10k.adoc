= Managing Puppet Modules with r10k

You can manage Puppet modules and environments using https://github.com/puppetlabs/r10k[r10k].
r10k uses a list of Puppet roles from a `Puppetfile` to download Puppet modules from the Puppet Forge or git repositories.
It does not handle dependencies between Puppet modules.

A _Puppetfile_ looks as follows:

[source,ruby]
----
forge "https://forge.puppet.com"

mod "puppet-nginx",
  :git => "https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-nginx.git",
  :ref => "master"

mod "puppetlabs/apache"
mod "puppetlabs/ntp", "8.3.0"
----

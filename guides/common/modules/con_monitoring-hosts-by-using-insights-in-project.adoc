= Monitoring hosts by using {insights-iop}

[role="_abstract"]
You can use local services of {insights-iop} to assess system health on hosts running {RHEL} without connecting to the {RHCloud}.
{insights-iop} provides advisor recommendations and vulnerability reports.

If you use {insights-iop}:

* The {Insights} services run locally on your {ProjectServer}.
* {Project} only communicates with the locally running services of {insights-iop}.
* {Project} does not send any reports to the {RHCloud}.
* {Project} does not forward any data through the Insights client to the {RHCloud}.
* You cannot use any of the hosted services on the {RHCloud}.

Your environment must meet the following requirements:
* You have installed {insights-iop} on your {ProjectServer}.
For more information, see {InstallingServerDisconnectedDocURL}installing-and-configuring-{insights-iop-id}[Installing and configuring {insights-iop}] in _{InstallingServerDisconnectedDocTitle}_.
* Install and configure the Insights client on hosts during host registration or provisioning.
For more information, see xref:Registering_Hosts_by_Using_Global_Registration_managing-hosts[].
* For hosts already registered to {Project}, install and configure the Insights client on your hosts by using an Ansible role.
For more information, see xref:deploying-insights-client-on-registered-hosts_{context}[].
* You can change the schedule for running the Insights client by configuring `insights-client.timer` on a host.

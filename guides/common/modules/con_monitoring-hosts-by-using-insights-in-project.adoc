= Monitoring hosts by using {insights-iop}

[role="_abstract"]
You can use {Insights} to diagnose systems and downtime related to security exploits, performance degradation, and stability failures without connecting to the {RHCloud}.

If you use {insights-iop}:

* {insights-iop} services run locally on your {ProjectServer}.
* You cannot use any of the hosted services on the {RHCloud}.
* {Project} only communicates with the locally running {insights-iop} services.
* {Project} does not send any reports to the {RHCloud}.
* {Project} does not forward any requests through {Insights} client to the {RHCloud}.

.Prerequisites
* You have installed {insights-iop} on your {ProjectServer}.
For more information, see xref:installing-and-configuring-{insights-iop-id}[Installing and configuring {insights-iop}].
* For new {Project} hosts, install and configure {insights} client during host registration to {Project}.
For more information, see xref:Registering_Hosts_by_Using_Global_Registration_managing-hosts[].
* For hosts already registered to {Project}, install and configure {insights} client on your hosts by using an Ansible role.
For more information, see xref:deploying-{insights-id}-client-on-registered-hosts_{context}[].
* You can change the default schedule for running `insights-client` by configuring `insights-client.timer` on a host.

= Adding Microsoft Azure Resource Manager Details to a Compute Profile

Use this procedure to add Azure hardware settings to a compute profile. When you create a host on Azure using this compute profile, these settings are automatically populated.

.Procedure

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Infrastructure* > *Compute Profiles*.
. In the Compute Profiles window, click the name of an existing compute profile, or click *Create Compute Profile*, enter a *Name*, and click *Submit*.
. Click the name of the Azure compute resource.
. From the *Resource group* list, select the resource group to provision to.
. From the *VM Size* list, select a size of a virtual machine to provision.
. From the *Platform* list, select *Linux*. {Project} does not support provisioning virtual machines running Microsoft operating systems.
. In the *Username* field, enter a user name to authenticate with. Note that the username that you enter for compute profile must be the same that you use when creating an image.
. To authenticate the user, use one of the following options:
* To authenticate using a password, enter a password in the *Password* field.
* To authenticate using an SSH key, enter an SSH key in the *SSH Key* field.

. Optional: If you want the virtual machine to use a premium virtual machine disk, select the *Premium OS Disk* check box.
. From the *OS Disk Caching* list, select the disc caching setting.
. Optional: In the *Custom Script Command* field, enter commands to perform on the virtual machine when the virtual machine is provisioned.
. Optional: If you want to run custom scripts when provisioning finishes, in the *Comma separated file URIs* field, enter comma-separated file URIs of scripts to use. The scripts must contain `sudo` at the beginning because {ProjectName} downloads files to the `/var/lib/waagent/custom-script/download/0/` directory on the host and scripts require sudo privileges to be executed.
. Optional: If you want to create an additional volume on the VM, click the *Add Volume* button, enter the *Size* in GB and select the *Data Disk Caching* method.
. Click *Add Interface*.
. From the *Azure Subnet* list, select the Azure subnet to provision to.
. From the *Public IP* list, select the public IP setting.
. Optional: If you want the virtual machine to use a static private IP, select the *Static Private IP* check box.
. Click *Submit*.

.For CLI Users

. Create a compute profile to use with the Azure Resource Manager compute resource:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer compute-profile create --name _compute_profile_name_
----

. Add Azure details to the compute profile. With the `username` setting, enter the SSH user name for image access. Note that the username that you enter for compute profile must be the same that you use when creating an image.
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer compute-profile values create \
--compute-profile "_compute_profile_name_" \
--compute-resource _azure_cr_name_ \
--compute-attributes="resource_group=_resource_group_,vm_size=_Standard_B1s_,username=_azure_user_,password=_azure_password_,platform=Linux,script_command=touch /var/tmp/text.txt" \
--interface="compute_public_ip=Dynamic,compute_network=mysubnetID,compute_private_ip=false"
--volume="disk_size_gb=_5_,data_disk_caching=_None_"
----
+
Optional: If you want to run scripts on the virtual machine after provisioning, specify the following settings:
+
* To enter the script directly, with the `script_command` setting, enter a command to be executed on the provisioned virtual machine.
* To run a script from a URI, with the `script_uris` setting, enter comma-separated file URIs of scripts to use. The scripts must contain `sudo` at the beginning because {ProjectName} downloads files to the `/var/lib/waagent/custom-script/download/0/` directory on the host and therefore scripts require sudo privileges to be executed.

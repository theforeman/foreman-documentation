= Advanced settings in the job wizard

Some job templates require you to enter advanced settings.
Some of the advanced settings are only visible to certain job templates.
Below is the list of general advanced settings.

// in order of appearance in the job wizard
SSH user::
A user to be used for connecting to the host through SSH.

Effective user::
A user to be used for executing the job.
By default it is the SSH user.
If it differs from the SSH user, su or sudo, depending on your settings, is used to switch the accounts.

* If you set an effective user in the advanced settings, Ansible sets `ansible_become_user` to your input value and `ansible_become` to `true`.
This means that if you use the parameters `become: true` and `become_user: _My_User_` within a playbook, these will be overwritten by {Project}.
* If your _SSH user_ and _effective user_ are identical, {Project} does not overwrite the `become_user`.
Therefore, you can set a custom `become_user` in your Ansible playbook.

Description::
A description template for the job.

Timeout to kill::
Time in seconds from the start of the job after which the job should be killed if it is not finished already.

Time to pickup::
Time in seconds after which the job is canceled if it is not picked up by a client.
This setting only applies to hosts using `pull-mqtt` transport.

Password::
Is used if SSH authentication method is a password instead of the SSH key.

Private key passphrase::
Is used if SSH keys are protected by a passphrase.

Effective user password::
Is used if effective user is different from the ssh user.

Concurrency level::
Defines the maximum number of jobs executed at once.
This can prevent overload of system resources in a case of executing the job on a large number of hosts.

Execution ordering::
Determines the order in which the job is executed on hosts.
It can be alphabetical or randomized.

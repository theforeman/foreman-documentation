= Additional maintenance required for load balancing

Configuring {SmartProxies} to use a load balancer results in a more complex environment and requires additional maintenance.

The following additional steps are required for load balancing:

* You must ensure that all {SmartProxies} have the same content.
If you publish a content view version on {Project}, synchronize it to all {SmartProxyServers}.
* You must upgrade each {SmartProxy} in sequence.

= Applying configurations

In following sections we suggest various tunables and how to apply them.
Please always test changing these in non production environment first, with valid backup and with proper outage window as in most of the cases {Project} restart is required.

It is also a good practice to setup a monitoring before applying any change as it will allow you to evaluate effect of the change.
Our testing environment might be too far from what you will see although we are trying hard to mimic real world environment.

.Changing systemd service files
If you have changed some systemd service file, you need to notify systemd daemon to reload the configuration:

----
# systemctl daemon-reload
----

Restart {Project} services:

[options="nowrap" subs="attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} service restart
----

.Changing configuration files
If you have changed a configuration file such as `/etc/foreman-installer/custom-hiera.yaml`, rerun installer to apply your changes:

[options="nowrap" subs="attributes"]
----
# {foreman-installer}
----

.Running installer with additional options
If you need to rerun installer with some new options added:

[options="nowrap" subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
# {foreman-installer} _new options_
----

.Checking basic sanity of the setup
Optional: After any change, run this quick {Project} health-check:

[options="nowrap" subs="attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} health check
----

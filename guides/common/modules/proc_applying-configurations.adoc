= Applying configurations

In following sections we suggest various tunables and how to apply them.
Please always test changing these in non production environment first, with valid backup and with proper outage window as in most of the cases {Project} restart is required.

It is also a good practice to setup a monitoring before applying any change as it will allow you to evaluate effect of the change.
Our testing environment might be too far from what you will see although we are trying hard to mimic real world environment.

If you have changed some systemd service file, you need to notify systemd daemon to reload the configuration:

----
# systemctl daemon-reload
----

Note this will still need to reload the service to do the actual change. It is best to restart whole {Project}:

[options="nowrap" subs="attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} service restart
----

If you have changed some configuration file like `/etc/foreman-installer/custom-hiera.yaml` you need to rerun installer to apply the changes:

[options="nowrap" subs="attributes"]
----
# {foreman-installer}
----

Also you might want to rerun installer with some new option, so you can:

[options="nowrap" subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
# {foreman-installer} _new options_
----

Optional: After any change, run this quick {Project} health-check:

[options="nowrap" subs="attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} health check
----

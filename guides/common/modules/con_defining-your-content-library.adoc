= Definining your content library

To ensure that your {ProjectServer} can manage software and provide it to your hosts, you must enable repositories and synchronize them.

* Enabling repositories allows you to choose the specific software required for your environment.
By enabling only the necessary repositories, you avoid downloading unnecessary content.
Different systems might need different sets of software.
* Synchronizing repositories downloads the content from Red{nbsp}Hat CDN or another source to your {ProjectServer}.
The synchronized content is stored on your {ProjectServer}, eliminating the need for hosts to access the repositories.
You can synchronize repositories manually, or you can create a sync plan to ensure synchronization runs on a regular basis.

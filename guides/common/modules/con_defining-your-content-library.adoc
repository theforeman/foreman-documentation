= Defining your content library

To ensure that your {ProjectServer} can manage software and provide it to your hosts, you must create repositories and synchronize them.

Red{nbsp}Hat content::
The Red{nbsp}Hat subscription manifest determines what Red{nbsp}Hat repositories your {ProjectServer} can access.
Red{nbsp}Hat content is already organized into products.
+
For example, {RHEL}{nbsp}Server is a product in {Project}.
The repositories for the {RHEL}{nbsp}Server product consist of different versions, architectures, and add-ons.
When you enable a Red{nbsp}Hat repository, {Project} automatically creates an associated product.

Oracle ULN content::
You can use {Project} to manage hosts running Oracle Linux.
For more information, see {ContentManagementDocURL}creating-uln-repositories[Creating ULN repositories] in _{ContentManagementDocTitle}_.

SUSE content::
You can use {Project} to manage hosts running {SLES}.
For more information, see {ContentManagementDocURL}Managing_SUSE_Content_content-management[Managing SUSE content] in _{ContentManagementDocTitle}_.

Ubuntu ESM content::
You can use {Project} to manage hosts running Ubuntu.
For more information, see {ContentManagementDocURL}Synchronizing-Ubuntu-Expanded-Security-Maintenance-content_content-management[Synchronizing Ubuntu Expanded Security Maintenance content] in _{ContentManagementDocTitle}_.
endif::[]

Other sources of content::
To distribute content from custom sources, you must create products and repositories manually.
You can organize other content into {customproduct}s however you want.
+
For example, you can create an EPEL (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux) product and add an "EPEL 9 x86_64" repository to it.

Creating repositories allows you to choose the specific software required for your environment.
By creating only the necessary repositories, you avoid downloading unnecessary content.

Synchronizing repositories downloads the content from Red{nbsp}Hat CDN or another source to your {ProjectServer}.
The synchronized content is stored on your {ProjectServer}, eliminating the need for hosts to access the repositories.
You can synchronize repositories manually, or you can create a sync plan to ensure synchronization runs on a regular basis.

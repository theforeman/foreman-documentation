[id="Using_{FreeIPA-context}_credentials_to_log_in_to_the_{project-context}_Hammer_CLI_{context}"]
= Logging in to Hammer CLI with {FreeIPA} credentials

Authenticate to the {Project} Hammer CLI with your {FreeIPA} username and password.

.Prerequisites
* You have configured Hammer CLI to accept {FreeIPA} credentials.
// See xref:configuring-hammer-cli-to-accept-{FreeIPA-context}-credentials_{context}[].

endif::[]

.Procedure
. Authenticate as a user defined in {FreeIPA} to obtain a Kerberos ticket-granting ticket (TGT):
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
$ kinit _{FreeIPA-context}_user_
----
+
[WARNING]
====
If you enabled access to the {Project} API and the {ProjectWebUI} when you were configuring {FreeIPA} as the authentication provider for {Project}, an attacker might now obtain an API session after the user receives the Kerberos TGT.
The attack is possible even if the user did not previously enter the {Project} login credentials anywhere, for example in the browser.
====
. If Hammer is not configured to negotiate authentication, initiate an authentication session manually:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
$ hammer auth login negotiate
----

[NOTE]
====
If you destroy the active Kerberos ticket, for example with `kdestroy`, you will still be logged in to Hammer.
To log out, enter `hammer auth logout`.
====

.Verification
* Use any `hammer` command to check that the system does not ask you to authenticate.
For example:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
$ hammer host list
----

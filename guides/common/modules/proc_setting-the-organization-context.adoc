= Setting the Organization Context

An organization context defines the organization to use for a host and its associated resources.

.Procedure

The organization menu is the first menu item in the menu bar, on the upper left of the {ProjectWebUI}.
If you have not selected a current organization, the menu says *Any Organization*.
Click the *Any Organization* button and select the organization to use.

.CLI procedure

While using the CLI, include either `--organization "_My_Organization_"` or `--organization-label "_My_Organization_Label_"` as an option.
For example:

[subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer subscription list \
--organization "_My_Organization_"
----

This command outputs subscriptions allocated for the _My_Organization_.

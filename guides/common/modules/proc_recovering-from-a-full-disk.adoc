= Recovering from a Full Disk

The following procedure describes how to resolve the situation when a logical volume (LV) with the Pulp database on it has no free space.

.Procedure
. Let running Pulp tasks finish but do not trigger any new ones as they can fail due to the full disk.
. Ensure that the LV with the `/var/lib/pulp` directory on it has sufficient free space.
Here are some ways to achieve that:
.. Remove orphaned content:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# foreman-rake katello:delete_orphaned_content RAILS_ENV=production
----
+
This is run weekly so it will not free much space.
.. Change the download policy from *Immediate* to *On Demand* for as many repositories as possible and remove already downloaded packages.

.. Grow the file system on the LV with the `/var/lib/pulp` directory on it.

[NOTE]
====
If you use an untypical file system (other than for example ext3, ext4, or xfs), you might need to unmount the file system so that it is not in use.
In that case, complete the following steps:

. Stop {Project} services:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} service stop
----
. Grow the file system on the LV.
. Start {Project} services:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} service start
----
====
. If some Pulp tasks failed due to the full disk, run them again.

[role="_abstract"]
With {Project}, you can assign permissions to groups of users.
You can also create user groups as collections of other user groups.
If you use an external authentication source, you can map {Project} user groups to external user groups as described in {ConfiguringUserAuthenticationDocURL}Configuring_External_User_Groups_authentication[Configuring external user groups] in _{ConfiguringUserAuthenticationDocTitle}_.

User groups are defined in an organizational context, meaning that you must select an organization before you can access user groups.

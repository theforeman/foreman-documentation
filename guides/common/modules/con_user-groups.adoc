[id="User_Groups_{context}"]
= User Groups

With {Project}, you can assign permissions to groups of users.
You can also create user groups as collections of other user groups.
If using an external authentication source, you can map {Project} user groups to external user groups as described in {InstallingServerDocURL}Configuring_External_User_Groups_{project-context}[Configuring external user groups] in _{InstallingServerDocTitle}_.

User groups are defined in an organizational context, meaning that you must select an organization before you can access user groups.

= Examining Compliance Failures of a Host

Using this procedure, you can examine a full compliance report, determine why a host failed compliance on a rule, and, in some cases, how to remediate a case of non-compliance.

[WARNING]
====
Do not implement any of the recommended remedial actions or scripts without first testing them in a non-production environment.

A compliance report consists of the following areas:

* Introduction
* Evaluation Characteristics
* Compliance and Scoring
* Rule Overview

.Prerequisite
* Your user account has the `view_arf_reports` and `view_hosts` permissions.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Hosts* > *Reports* to list all compliance reports.
. In the row of the required host, navigate to the *Actions* column and click *Full Report* to view the complete details of an evaluation report.
. Navigate to the *Evaluation Characteristics* area to review basic details about the evaluation of the host against a specific profile.
. Navigate to the *Compliance and Scoring* area to review evaluation statistics and the host compliance score.
. Navigate to the *Rule Overview* to examine the rules.
. Optional: Unselect the check statuses that you want to hide, such as *pass*, *notapplicable*, or *fixed*.
. Optional: From the *Group rule by* dropdown menu, select the criterion for the grouping of rules, such as *Severity*.
. Optional: Enter a search string into the search field to filter rules by title.
The search is case insensitive and applied dynamically as you type.

** A description of the rule with instructions for bringing the host into compliance if available.
** The rationale for the rule.

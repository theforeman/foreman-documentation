= Managing Flatpak repositories in {Project}

Flatpak allows users to install, manage, and run portable applications on {Project}, primarily for desktop environments.
In {Project}, you can integrate Flatpak repositories to distribute and control Flatpak applications across managed hosts. 
By configuring Flatpak repositories, you ensure that systems have access to the necessary application packages while maintaining centralized control over application deployment.

Flatpak repositories function similarly to other content repositories in {Project}. 
You can synchronize, manage access permissions, and assign repositories to specific lifecycle environments to control which applications are available to systems. 
You can also use Hammer CLI to manage Flatpak repositories.

= User Roles for Application Centric Deployment

The ACD plugin requires the specific {Project} permissions.
Depending on your environment, there might be two different groups of users in regard to managing an application and deploying an application:

You can interact with three different resources for ACD:

.ACD Resources
* Ansible playbooks: *Applications > Ansible Playbooks*
* Application definitions: *Applications > App Definitions*
* Application instances: *Applications > App Instances*

You can create custom roles in the {ProjectWebUI} based on existing user role filters for these resources.

* An administrative group of users might be responsible for providing the tools to deploy an application, that is an Ansible playbook and application definition.
Note that the *Ansible playbook* is not related to the Ansible plugin for configuration management.
* An end user group might be using {Project} to deploy applications, that is creating and deploying application instances based on application definitions within their organization and location context.
Many application instances can be created based on the same application definition.

By default, there are two ACD user roles:

Application Centric Deployment Manager::
Configuring Ansible playbooks and application definitions requires the `Application Centric Deployment Manager` user role.
It bundles permissions to manage Ansible playbooks, application definitions, and application instances as well as using ACD remote execution features.
This role is suited for administrative users.
The ACD manager role includes permissions to deploy and configure hosts; to manage Ansible playbooks, application definitions, and application instances; and to view, create, and cancel job invocations and templates.

Application Centric Deployment User::
Creating and deploying application instances requires the `Application Centric Deployment User` user role.
It bundles permissions to manage application instances and access to the ACD remote execution features.
This role is suited for end users.
The ACD user role includes permissions to deploy and configure hosts; to manage application instances; and to view, create, and cancel job invocations and templates.

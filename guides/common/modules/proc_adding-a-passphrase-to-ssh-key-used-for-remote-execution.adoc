= Adding a passphrase to SSH key used for remote execution

By default, {SmartProxy} uses a non-passphrase protected SSH key to execute remote jobs on hosts.
You can protect the SSH key with a passphrase by following this procedure.

.Procedure
* On your {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer}, use `ssh-keygen` to add a passphrase to your SSH key:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# ssh-keygen -p -f ~foreman-proxy/.ssh/id_rsa_foreman_proxy
----

.Next steps
* Users now must use a passphrase when running remote execution jobs on hosts.

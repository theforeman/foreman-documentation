[TIP]
====
If the _Puppet classes_ tab of an individual host is empty, check if it is assigned to the proper Puppet environment.
====

Select the *YAML* button on the host overview page to verify the Puppet configuration.
This produces output similar as follows:

[source, yaml, options="nowrap", subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
---
parameters:
  // shortened YAML output
classes:
  ntp:
    servers: '["0.de.pool.ntp.org","1.de.pool.ntp.org","2.de.pool.ntp.org","3.de.pool.ntp.org"]'
environment: production
...
----

Connect to your host using SSH and check the content of `/etc/ntp.conf` to verify the ntp configuration.
This examples assumes your host is running _CentOS 7_.
Other operating systems may store the ntp config file in a different path.

[TIP]
====
You may need to run the Puppet agent on your host by executing the following command:

[options="nowrap", subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
# puppet agent -t
----
====

Running the following command on the host checks which ntp servers are used for clock synchronization:

[options="nowrap", subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
# cat /etc/ntp.conf
----

This returns output similar as follows:

[options="nowrap", subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
# ntp.conf: Managed by puppet.
server 0.de.pool.ntp.org
server 1.de.pool.ntp.org
server 2.de.pool.ntp.org
server 3.de.pool.ntp.org
----

You now have a working ntp module which you can add to a host or group of hosts to roll out your ntp configuration automatically.

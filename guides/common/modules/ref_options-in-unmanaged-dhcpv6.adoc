= Options in unmanaged DHCPv6

To provision hosts over TFTP in an IPv6-only network, configure the DHCP server to respond with the `bootfile-url` DHCP option.
{Project} cannot manage the DHCPv6 service, therefore, you have to configure your DHCP server manually.

`bootfile-url`::
The URL value of this option has to point to a file on TFTP {SmartProxy} that is a first-stage boot loader, such as `pxelinux.0`.
Example configuration:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes,verbatim"]

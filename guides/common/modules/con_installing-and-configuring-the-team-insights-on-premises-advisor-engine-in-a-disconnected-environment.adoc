= Installing and configuring the {Team} Insights On-Premises advisor engine

The {Team} Insights On-Premises (IoP) advisor engine helps {RHEL} systems perform efficiently, keeping them secure and available.
It analyzes system health and configuration by applying predefined rules to a small set of local data, such as installed packages, running services, and configuration settings. 
When you deploy the {Team} IoP advisor engine locally on {Project}, you can generate Insights recommendations without sending system data to {Team} services.

You can install and configure the {Team} IoP advisor engine on a disconnected {ProjectServer} by using either the {Project} installation ISO or a container image import and export.

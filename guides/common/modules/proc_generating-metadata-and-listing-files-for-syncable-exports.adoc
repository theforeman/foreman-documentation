= Generating metadata and listing files for syncable exports

In most cases, when exporting content in a syncable format using root privileges and the standard commands, metadata and listing files are generated automatically. However, you must manually trigger the generation of these files in the following circumstances:

* When a non-root user is doing the export.
* When the `--async` flag has been passed, for root or non-root user.
* When triggering API manually or using Ansible modules to do the exports.

.Prerequisites
* The syncable export directory is accessible on disk.

.Procedure
. To generate metadata for a syncable export that was performed asynchronously or if the metadata was lost, use the following command:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer content-export generate-metadata --path=/path/to/syncable/export
----
+
. To generate listing files for a syncable export directory, use the following command:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer content-export generate-listing --path=/path/to/syncable/export

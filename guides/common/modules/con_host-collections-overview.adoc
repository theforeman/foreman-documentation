= Host collections overview

A host collection is a group of content hosts.

With host collections, you can perform the same action on multiple hosts at once.
These actions include installing, removing, and updating packages and errata, and assigning content view environments.

For example, you can use host collections to group hosts by function, department, or business unit.

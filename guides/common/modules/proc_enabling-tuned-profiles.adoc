= Enabling Tuned Profiles

{RHEL} 7 enables the tuned daemon by default during installation.
On bare-metal, {Team} recommends to run the `throughput-performance` tuned profile on {ProjectServer} and {SmartProxies}.
On virtual machines, {Team} recommends to run the `virtual-guest` profile.

.Procedure
. Check if `tuned` is running:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# systemctl status tuned
----
. If `tuned` is not running, enable it:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# systemctl enable --now tuned
----
. Optional: View a list of available `tuned` profiles:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# tuned-adm list
----
. Enable a `tuned` profile depending on your scenario:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# tuned-adm profile "_My_Tuned_Profile_"

Transparent Huge Pages is a memory management technique used by the Linux kernel which reduces the overhead of using Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) by using larger sized memory pages.
Due to databases having Sparse Memory Access patterns instead of Contiguous Memory access patterns, database workloads often perform poorly when Transparent Huge Pages is enabled.
To improve performance of PostgreSQL, disable Transparent Huge Pages.
In deployments where the PostgreSQL database is running on a separate server, there may be a small benefit to using Transparent Huge Pages on the {ProjectServer} only.

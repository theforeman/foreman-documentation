= Grub2 UEFI boot loader and the `bootloader-universe` structure

*PXEGrub2* GRUB-based PXE boot loader supports BIOS and UEFI environments, as well as Secure Boot environments.
The `bootloader-universe` directory structure organizes Grub2 binaries by OS and architecture.

PXEGrub2 is managed by the {SmartProxy}’s TFTP service, which provides PXE clients with the appropriate boot loader binaries and configuration files.

By using the `bootloader-universe` directory structure, Grub2-based UEFI boot loaders can be organized and managed by distribution, version, and architecture.
This feature does not require explicit configuration; it is automatically enabled when the {SmartProxy} uses the
`/var/lib/tftpboot/bootloader-universe/pxegrub2/` directory structure.

== Directory Structure: `bootloader-universe`

This section explains the purpose and layout of the `bootloader-universe` directory, which enables multiple OS versions and architectures to coexist cleanly.

=== Organized Hierarchy by OS and Architecture

When the {SmartProxy} recognizes the `/var/lib/tftpboot/bootloader-universe/pxegrub2/` structure,
boot loaders are stored in an organized hierarchy by OS, version, and architecture.
This allows multiple distributions and versions to coexist without conflicts.

Before placing boot loader binaries (`shim<__arch__>.efi`, `grub<__arch__>.efi`), you must manually create the corresponding directory hierarchy using the `mkdir` command.

Example:
----
mkdir -p /var/lib/tftpboot/bootloader-universe/pxegrub2/rocky/9.5/x86_64
----

=== File Locations and Roles

The following table summarizes the purpose of each directory in the `bootloader-universe` hierarchy.

|===
| Path
| Purpose / Usage
| User Action

| `/var/lib/tftpboot/bootloader-universe/pxegrub2/<__distro__>/<__version__>/<__arch__>/`
| Stores OS- and architecture-specific Grub2 binaries (shim<__arch__>.efi, grub<__arch__>.efi) and symbolic links (boot.efi, boot-sb.efi).
Used for version-specific boot loader management within the `bootloader-universe` hierarchy.
| **Create manually**

| `/var/lib/tftpboot/bootloader-universe/pxegrub2/<__distro__>/default/<__arch__>/`
| Stores OS- and architecture-specific Grub2 binaries (shim<__arch__>.efi, grub<__arch__>.efi) and symbolic links (boot.efi, boot-sb.efi).
Used as a fallback directory when a specific version is not available.
| **Create manually**

| /var/lib/tftpboot/host-config/<__My_MAC_Address__>/grub2/
| Host-specific directory automatically created when a host enters *Build mode*.
Contains symbolic links (boot.efi, boot-sb.efi) and a generated grub.cfg.
| *Auto-created by {SmartProxy}*

----

[NOTE]
====
* In `bootloader-universe/pxegrub2/<__distro__>/<__version__>/<__arch__>/`,
`boot.efi` and `boot-sb.efi` are symbolic links to `grub<__arch__>.efi` and `shim<__arch__>.efi`, respectively.
The {SmartProxy} automatically creates host-specific links to these files under `host-config/<__My_MAC_Address__>/grub2/`.

* In the {ProjectWebUI}, OS and distribution identifiers (`<__distro__>`) must not contain spaces.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must manually create `boot.efi` and `boot-sb.efi` symbolic links within each `<__arch__>` directory.

Example (x86_64):
[subs="+quotes"]
----
$ ln -s grubx64.efi boot.efi
$ ln -s shimx64.efi boot-sb.efi
$ chmod 644 grubx64.efi shimx64.efi
----

The `chmod` command ensures that TFTP and HTTPBoot clients can read these files.
====

== Legacy Layout (Non-`bootloader-universe`)

This section explains how boot loaders are handled when the `bootloader-universe` directory is not used.
This layout remains supported for backward compatibility.

If the `/var/lib/tftpboot/bootloader-universe/pxegrub2/` structure is not used,
{Project} falls back to the legacy `/var/lib/tftpboot/grub2/` directory.
Boot loaders are stored in a flat layout, but when a host enters *Build mode*, the {SmartProxy} creates a host-specific directory with the required configuration files and links.

| /var/lib/tftpboot/grub2/
| Default directory used when `bootloader-universe` is not enabled.
Contains Grub2 UEFI boot loader binaries such as grubx64.efi, shimx64.efi, grubaa64.efi, and shimaa64.efi.
| Place the appropriate boot loader binaries (grub<__arch__>.efi, shim<__arch__>.efi) in this directory.
No subdirectory creation is required.

| /var/lib/tftpboot/host-config/<__My_MAC_Address__>/grub2/
| Host-specific directory automatically created when a host enters *Build mode*.
Contains symbolic links (boot.efi, boot-sb.efi) and a generated grub.cfg.

= Manually tuning Puma workers and threads count

If you decide not to rely on xref:Puma_Workers_and_Threads_Auto_Tuning_{context}[], you can apply custom numbers for these tunables.
In the example below we are using 2 workers, 5 and 5 threads:

[options="nowrap", subs="+attributes"]
----
# {foreman-installer} \
--foreman-foreman-service-puma-workers=2 \
--foreman-foreman-service-puma-threads-min=5 \
--foreman-foreman-service-puma-threads-max=5
----

Apply your changes to {ProjectServer}.
For more information, see xref:Applying_configurations_{context}[].

= Planning organization and location context

Context in {Project} consists of organizations and locations.
You can associate most resources, for example hosts, subnets, and domains, with at least one organization and location context.

Resources and users can generally only access resources within their own context, which makes configuring organizations and locations an integral part of access management in {Project}.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you use host groups to bundle provisioning and configuration information, avoid mismatching resources from mutually exclusive contexts.
For example, setting a subnet from one organization or location and a compute resource from a different organization or location creates an invalid host group.

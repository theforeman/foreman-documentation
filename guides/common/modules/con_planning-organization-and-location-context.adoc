= Planning organization and location context

Context in {Project} consists of organizations and locations.
You can associate most resources, for example hosts, subnets, and domains, with at least one organization and location context.

Organizations and locations enable you to arrange {Project} resources into logically structured groups.
For example, you can create groups based on ownership, purpose,
ifdef::katello,orcharhino,satellite[]
content,
endif::[]
or security level.
ifdef::satellite[]
You can create and manage multiple organizations through {ProjectName}, then divide and assign your Red{nbsp}Hat subscriptions to each individual organization.
endif::[]
ifndef::foreman-deb,foreman-el,satellite[]
You can create and manage multiple organizations through {ProjectName}, then divide and assign subscriptions to each individual organization.
endif::[]

Organizations::
Organizations can represent different business units, departments, or teams, such as _Finance_, _Marketing_, or _Web Development_.
ifdef::satellite[]
Each organization requires a separate Red{nbsp}Hat subscription manifest.
endif::[]
ifndef::foreman-deb,foreman-el,satellite[]
To manage Red{nbsp}Hat content, each organization requires a separate Red{nbsp}Hat subscription manifest.
endif::[]
+
By creating organizations, you can create logical containers to isolate and manage their configurations separately according to their specific requirements.

Locations::
Locations can represent physical locations, such as countries or cities.
+
By creating locations, you can define geographical sites where hosts are located.
For example, this is useful in environments with multiple data centers.
+
You can use locations to map the network infrastructure to prevent incorrect host placement or configuration.
While you cannot assign a subnet, domain, or compute resources directly to a {SmartProxyServer}, you can assign them to a location.
+
Unlike organizations, locations can have a hierarchical structure.
Resources and users can generally only access resources within their own context, which makes configuring organizations and locations an integral part of access management in {Project}.
+
When assigning organizations or locations to resources, users with the `assign_organizations` or `assign_locations` permissions can only assign organizations or locations that they belong to.

{ProjectServer} defines all locations and organizations.
Each {SmartProxyServer}
ifdef::katello,orcharhino,satellite[]
synchronizes content and
endif::[]
handles configuration of hosts in a different location.

Your {ProjectServer} retains the management function, while the
ifdef::katello,orcharhino,satellite[]
content and
endif::[]
configuration is synchronized between your {ProjectServer} and {SmartProxyServers} assigned to certain locations.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you use host groups to bundle provisioning and configuration information, avoid mismatching resources from mutually exclusive contexts.
For example, setting a subnet from one organization or location and a compute resource from a different organization or location creates an invalid host group.
====

ifdef::foreman-el,foreman-deb[]
Some resources in {Project}, such as Ansible roles and operating systems, are not part of any organization or location context.
endif::[]

.Example of using organizations and locations in {Project}
====
The structure of a multi-national company includes the Finance, Marketing, and Sales departments.
The company operates across United States, United Kingdom, and Japan.

The system administrator creates the following organizations on their {ProjectServer}:

* Finance
* Marketing
* Sales

Additionally, the administrator creates the following locations on their {ProjectServer}:

* United States
* United Kingdom
* Japan

The administrator can define a nested location hierarchy to divide the United States location into additional locations based on specific cities:

* Boston
* Phoenix
* San Francisco

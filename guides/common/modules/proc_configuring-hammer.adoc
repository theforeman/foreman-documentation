= Configuring Hammer

The default location for global `hammer` configuration is:

* */etc/hammer/cli_config.yml* for general `hammer` settings

* */etc/hammer/cli.modules.d/* for CLI module configuration files

You can set user specific directives for `hammer` (in *~/.hammer/cli_config.yml*) as well as for CLI modules (in respective *.yml* files under *~/.hammer/cli.modules.d/*).

To see the order in which configuration files are loaded, as well as versions of loaded modules, use:

[options="nowrap", subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
$ hammer -d --version
----

[NOTE]
====
Loading configuration for many CLI modules can slow down the execution of `hammer` commands.
In such a case, consider disabling CLI modules that are not regularly used.
====
Apart from saving credentials as described in xref:hammer-authentication[], you can set several other options in the *~/.hammer/* configuration directory.
For example, you can change the default log level and set log rotation with the following directives in *~/.hammer/cli_config.yml*.
These directives affect only the current user and are not applied globally.

[options="nowrap", subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
:log_level: 'warning'
:log_size: 5 #in MB
----

Similarly, you can configure user interface settings.
For example, set the number of entries displayed per request in the Hammer output by changing the following line:

----
:per_page: 30
----

This setting is an equivalent of the `--per-page` Hammer option.

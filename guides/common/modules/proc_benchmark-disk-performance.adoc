= Benchmarking Disk Performance

We are working to update `{foreman-maintain}` to only warn the users when its internal quick https://fio.readthedocs.io[fio] benchmark results in numbers below our recommended throughput but will not require a whitelist parameter to continue.

Also working on an updated benchmark script you can run (which will likely be integrated into `{foreman-maintain}` in the future) to get a more accurate real-world storage information.

[NOTE]
====
* One may have to temporarily reduce the RAM in order to run the io benchmark, aka if the box has 256 GiB that is a lot of Pulp space, so add `mem=20G` as a kernel option in grub.
This is needed because script will execute a series of fio based IO tests against a targeted directory specified in its execution.
This test will create a very large file that is double (2x) the size of the physical RAM on this system to ensure that we are not just testing the caching at the OS level of the storage.
* Please bear above in mind when performing benchmark of other filesystems if you have them (like PostgreSQL storage) which might have significantly smaller capacity than Pulp storage and perhaps on different set of storage (SAN, iSCSI, etc).
====

This test does not use directio and will utilize the OS plus caching as normal operations would.

// Would it make sense to package this script for Foreman?
You can find our first version of the script https://github.com/RedHatSatellite/satellite-support/blob/master/storage-benchmark[storage-benchmark].
To execute just download to your {Project}, `chmod +x` the script and run:

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# ./storage-benchmark /var/lib/pulp
----

As noted in the README block in the script: generally you wish to see on average 100MB/sec or higher in the tests below:

* Local SSD based storage should values of 600MB/sec or higher.
* Spinning disks should see values in the range of 100-200MB/sec or higher.

If you see values below this, please open a support ticket for assistance.

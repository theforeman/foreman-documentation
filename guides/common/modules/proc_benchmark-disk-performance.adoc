= Benchmarking Disk Performance

We are working to update `{foreman-maintain}` to only warn the users when its internal quick storage benchmark results in numbers below our recommended throughput.

Also working on an updated benchmark script you can run (which will likely be integrated into `{foreman-maintain}` in the future) to get a more accurate real-world storage information.

[NOTE]
====
* You may have to temporarily reduce the RAM in order to run the I/O benchmark.
For example, if your {ProjectServer} has 256 GiB RAM, tests would require 512 GiB of storage to run.
As a workaround, you can add `mem=20G` kernel option in grub during system boot to temporary reduce the size of the RAM.
The benchmark creates a file twice the size of the RAM in the specified directory and executes a series of storage I/O tests against it.
The size of the file ensures that the test is not just testing the filesystem caching.
If you benchmark other filesystems, for example smaller volumes such as PostgreSQL storage, you might have to reduce the RAM size as described above.
* If you are using different storage solutions such as SAN or iSCSI, you can expect a different performance.
* {Team} recommends you to stop all services before executing this script and you will be prompted to do so.
====

This test does not use direct I/O and will utilize file caching as normal operations would.

// Would it make sense to package this script for Foreman?
You can find our first version of the script https://github.com/RedHatSatellite/satellite-support/blob/master/storage-benchmark[storage-benchmark].
To execute it, just download the script to your {Project}, make it executable, and run:

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# ./storage-benchmark /var/lib/pulp
----

As noted in the README block in the script, generally you wish to see on average 100MB/sec or higher in the tests below:

* Local SSD based storage should give values of 600MB/sec or higher.
* Spinning disks should give values in the range of 100{range}200MB/sec or higher.

If you see values below this, please open a support ticket for assistance.

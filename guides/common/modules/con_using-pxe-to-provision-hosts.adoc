= Using PXE to Provision Hosts

You can provision bare metal instances with {Project} using one of the following methods:

Unattended Provisioning::
New hosts are identified by a MAC address and {ProjectServer} provisions the host using a PXE boot process.

Unattended Provisioning with Discovery::
New hosts use PXE boot to load the {Project} Discovery service.
This service identifies hardware information about the host and lists it as an available host to provision.
For more information, see xref:Configuring_the_Discovery_Service_{context}[].

PXE-less Provisioning::
ifndef::satellite[]
New hosts are provisioned with a boot disk or PXE-less discovery image that {ProjectServer} generates.

PXE-less Provisioning with Discovery::
New hosts use an ISO boot disk that loads the {Project} Discovery service.
This service identifies hardware information about the host and lists it as an available host to provision.
For more information, see xref:Implementing_PXE_less_Discovery_{context}[].
endif::[]
ifdef::satellite[]
New hosts are provisioned with a boot disk image that {ProjectServer} generates.

[NOTE]
====
Discovery workflows are only available when the Discovery plug-in is installed.

.BIOS and UEFI Support
With {ProjectName}, you can perform both BIOS and UEFI based PXE provisioning.
Both BIOS and UEFI interfaces work as interpreters between the computer's operating system and firmware, initializing the hardware components and starting the operating system at boot time.

For information about supported workflows, see https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2674001[Supported architectures and provisioning scenarios].

In {Project} provisioning, the PXE loader option defines the DHCP `filename` option to use during provisioning.
For BIOS systems, use the *PXELinux BIOS* option to enable a provisioned node to download the `pxelinux.0` file over TFTP.
For UEFI systems, use the *PXEGrub2 UEFI* option to enable a TFTP client to download `grub2/grubx64.efi` file, or use the *PXEGrub2 UEFI HTTP* option to enable an UEFI HTTP client to download `grubx64.efi` from {SmartProxy} with the HTTP Boot feature.
ifndef::satellite[]
Use SecureBoot options to enable a client to download the `shim.efi` bootstrap bootloader that then loads the signed `grubx64.efi`.
Other PXE loaders like PXELinux UEFI, Grub2 ELF or iPXE Chain, require additional configuration. These workflows are not documented at the moment.
endif::[]

For BIOS provisioning, you must associate a PXELinux template with the operating system.
For UEFI provisioning, you must associate a PXEGrub2 template with the operating system.
If you associate both PXELinux and PXEGrub2 templates, {Project} can deploy configuration files for both on a TFTP server, so that you can switch between PXE loaders easily.

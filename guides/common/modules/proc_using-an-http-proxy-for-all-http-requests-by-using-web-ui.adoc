[id="using-an-http-proxy-for-all-{project-context}-http-requests-by-using-web-ui"]
= Using an HTTP proxy for all {Project} HTTP requests by using {ProjectWebUI}

If your {ProjectServer} remains behind a firewall that blocks HTTP and HTTPS, configure a HTTP proxy for communication with external systems, including compute resources.

If you are using compute resources for provisioning, and you want to use a different HTTP proxy with the compute resources, the HTTP proxy that you set for all {Project} communication takes precedence over the proxies that you set for compute resources.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Administer* > *Settings*.
. In the *HTTP(S) proxy* row, select the adjacent *Value* column and enter your HTTP proxy URL.
. Click the tick icon to save your changes.

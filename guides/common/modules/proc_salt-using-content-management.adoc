= Using {Project}s Content Management

Provide managed hosts with the required Salt Minion client software using {Project}.

.Procedure
. Create a product called `Salt`.
For more information, see {ContentManagementDocURL}Creating_a_Custom_Product_content-management[Creating a Custom Product].
. Create a repository within the _Salt_ product for each operating system supported by {Project} that you want to install the Salt Minion client software on.
For more information, see {ContentManagementDocURL}Adding_Custom_RPM_Repositories_content-management[Adding RPM Repositories] or {ContentManagementDocURL}Adding_Custom_DEB_Repositories_content-management[Adding DEB Repositories].
+
Add the operating system to the name of the repository, for example `Salt for Ubuntu 20.04`.
+
You can find the _upstream URL_ for the Salt packages on the https://repo.saltproject.io/[official Salt package repository].
The URL depends on both the Salt version and the operating system, for example `\https://repo.saltproject.io/py3/ubuntu/20.04/amd64/3003/`.
. Synchronize the previously created products.
For more information, see {ContentManagementDocURL}Synchronizing_Repositories_content-management[Synchronizing Repositories].
. Create a Content View for each repository.
For more information, see {ContentManagementDocURL}Creating_a_Content_View_content-management[Creating a Content View].
. Create a Composite Content View for each major version of each operating system to make the new content available.
For more information, see {ContentManagementDocURL}Creating_a_Composite_Content_View_content-management[Create a Composite Content View].
. Add each of your operating system specific Salt Content Views to your main Composite Content View for that operating system and version.
. Publish a new version of the Composite Content View from the previous step.
. Promote the Content View from the previous step to your lifecycle environments as appropriate.
For more information, see {ContentManagementDocURL}Promoting_a_Content_View_content-management[Promoting a Content View].
. Optional: Create activation keys for your Composite Content View and lifecycle environment combinations.

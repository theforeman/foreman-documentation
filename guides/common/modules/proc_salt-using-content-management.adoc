= Using {Project}s Content Management

This section provides best practice recommendations on how to provide managed hosts with the required Salt Minion client software using {Project}.

.Procedure
. Create and synchronize the required products and repositories.
.. Create a product called `Salt`.
.. Create a repository within the `Salt` product for each operating system supported by {Project} that you want to install the Salt Minion client software on.
+
Add the operating system to the name of the repository, for example `Salt for Ubuntu 20.04`.
+
You can find the _upstream URL_ for the Salt packages on the https://repo.saltproject.io/[official Salt package repository].
The URL depends on both the Salt version and the operating system, for example `\https://repo.saltproject.io/py3/ubuntu/20.04/amd64/3003/`.
.. Synchronize the previously created products.
. Create and publish the required content views.
.. Create a content view for each repository.
.. Publish a content view for each of your content views from the previous step.
. Create a composite content views for each major version of each operating system to make the new content available.
.. Add each of your operating system specific Salt content views to your main composite content view for that operating system and version.
.. Publish a new version of the composite content view from the previous step.
.. Promote the content view from the previous step to your lifecycle environments as appropriate.
.. Optional: Create activation keys for your composite content view and lifecycle environment combinations.

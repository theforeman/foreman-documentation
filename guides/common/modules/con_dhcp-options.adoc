= {Project} and DHCP options

{Project} manages DHCP reservations through a DHCP {SmartProxy}.
{Project} also sets the `next-server` and `filename` DHCP options.

.The next-server option
The `next-server` option provides the IP address of the TFTP server to boot from.
This option is not set by default and must be set for each TFTP {SmartProxy}.
You can use the `{foreman-installer}` command with the `--foreman-proxy-tftp-servername` option to set the TFTP server in the `/etc/foreman-proxy/settings.d/tftp.yml` file:

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-installer} --foreman-proxy-tftp-servername _1.2.3.4_
----

Each TFTP {SmartProxy} then reports this setting through the API and {Project} can retrieve the configuration information when it creates the DHCP record.

When the PXE loader is set to `none`, {Project} does not populate the `next-server` option into the DHCP record.

If the `next-server` option remains undefined, {Project} calls the {SmartProxy} API to retrieve the server name as specified by the `--foreman-proxy-tftp-servername` argument in a `{foreman-installer}` run.
If the {SmartProxy} API call does not return a server name, {Project} uses the hostname of the {SmartProxy}.

.The filename option
The `filename` option contains the full path to the file that downloads and executes during provisioning.
The PXE loader that you select for the host or host group defines which `filename` option to use.
When the PXE loader is set to `none`, {Project} does not populate the `filename` option into the DHCP record.
Depending on the PXE loader option, the `filename` changes as follows:

|=======
|PXE loader option | filename entry| Notes

|PXELinux BIOS | `pxelinux.0`|
|PXELinux UEFI | `pxelinux.efi`|
|iPXE Chain BIOS | `undionly.kpxe`|
|PXEGrub2 UEFI | `grub2/grubx64.efi`| x64 can differ depending on architecture
|iPXE UEFI HTTP | `http://_{smartproxy-example-com}_:8000/httpboot/ipxe-x64.efi` | Requires the `httpboot` feature and renders the `filename` as a full URL where _{smartproxy-example-com}_ is a known host name of {SmartProxy} in {Project}.
|Grub2 UEFI HTTP | `http://_{smartproxy-example-com}_:8000/httpboot/grub2/grubx64.efi` | Requires the `httpboot` feature and renders the `filename` as a full URL where _{smartproxy-example-com}_ is a known host name of {SmartProxy} in {Project}.

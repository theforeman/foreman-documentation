= Enabling the installer-managed TFTP service

If you do not have a TFTP server available in your network, you can use the installer-managed TFTP service to perform unattended installations.
With the installer-managed TFTP service, you can run a TFTP server with a low maintenance effort because {Project} fully manages the TFTP service, including the files on that service.

Perform the steps on the {Project} or {SmartProxyServer} that you want to configure as TFTP service.


.Procedure

* Configure {Project} or {SmartProxy} as TFTP server:
+
[options="nowrap",subs="+quotes,attributes"]
....
# {foreman-installer} \
--foreman-proxy-tftp true \
--foreman-proxy-tftp-managed true
....

= Enabling the installer-managed TFTP service

If you do not have a TFTP server available in your network, you can use the installer-managed TFTP service. This feature enables you to provide a TFTP service with a low maintenance effort.

Perform the steps on the {Project} or {SmartProxyServer} that you want to configure to manage the DHCP service for the subnet.


.Procedure

* Configure {Project} or {SmartProxy} as TFTP server:
+
[options="nowrap",subs="+quotes,attributes"]
....
# {foreman-installer} \
--foreman-proxy-tftp true \
--foreman-proxy-tftp-managed true \
....

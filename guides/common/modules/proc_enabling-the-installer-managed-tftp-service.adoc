= Enabling the installer-managed TFTP service

If you do not have a TFTP server available in your network, you can use the installer-managed TFTP service. This feature enables you to provide a TFTP service with a low maintenance effort.

Perform the steps on the {Project} or {SmartProxyServer} that you want to configure to manage the DHCP service for the subnet.


.Prerequisites

* You know the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) or the IP address of the TFTP server.
Prefer the FQDN to avoid having to adjust the configuration if the IP address of the TFTP server changes.


.Procedure

. Backup the answer files:
+
[options="nowrap",subs="+quotes,attributes"]
....
# mkdir /root/backup-answer-files/
# cp -p /etc/foreman-installer/scenarios.d/*-answers.yml /root/backup-answer-files/
....

. Configure {Project} or {SmartProxy} as TFTP server:
+
[options="nowrap",subs="+quotes,attributes"]
....
# {foreman-installer} \
--foreman-proxy-tftp true \
--foreman-proxy-tftp-managed true \
--foreman-proxy-tftp-servername 192.0.2.3
....

= Obtaining the location of the CA bundle for {Project}

[role="_abstract"]
To deploy the MCP server for {Project}, the CA bundle for {Project} must be available on the system where the MCP server is being deployed.
The CA bundle is the certificate of a CA which signed the certificate that is used to secure {ProjectWebUI}.

Perform these steps on your {ProjectServer} or ask your administrator to perform them for you.

.Procedure
. Locate the CA bundle.
For example, if you are using the default self-signed {Project} certificate, obtain the CA bundle location by inspecting the *SSLCACertificateFile* value in the `/etc/httpd/conf.d/05-foreman-ssl.conf` file:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# cat /etc/httpd/conf.d/05-foreman-ssl.conf | awk -F '"' '/SSLCACertificateFile/ { print $2 }'
----
+
The default location is
ifdef::katello,orcharhino,satellite[]
`/etc/pki/katello/certs/katello-default-ca.crt`
endif::[]
ifdef::foreman-deb,foreman-el[]
`/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/certs/ca.pem`
endif::[]
.
. If you are deploying the MCP server on a system other than your {ProjectServer}, transfer the CA bundle to that system.

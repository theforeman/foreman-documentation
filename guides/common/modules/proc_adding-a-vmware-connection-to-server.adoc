[id="Adding_a_VMware_Connection_to_Server_{context}"]
= Adding a VMware Connection to {ProjectServer}

Use this procedure to add a VMware vSphere connection in {ProjectServer}'s compute resources.
To use the CLI instead of the {ProjectWebUI}, see the xref:cli-adding-vmware-vsphere-connection_{context}[].

.Prerequisites
* Ensure that the host and network-based firewalls are configured to allow communication from {ProjectServer} to vCenter on TCP port 443.
* Verify that {ProjectServer} and vCenter can resolve each other's host names.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Infrastructure* > *Compute Resources*, and in the Compute Resources window, click *Create Compute Resource*.
. In the *Name* field, enter a name for the resource.
. From the *Provider* list, select *VMware*.
. In the *Description* field, enter a description for the resource.
. In the *VCenter/Server* field, enter the IP address or host name of the vCenter server.
. In the *User* field, enter the user name with permission to access the vCenter's resources.
. In the *Password* field, enter the password for the user.
. Click *Load Datacenters* to populate the list of data centers from your VMware vSphere environment.
. From the *Datacenter* list, select a specific data center to manage from this list.
. In the *Fingerprint* field, ensure that this field is populated with the fingerprint from the data center.
. From the *Display Type* list, select a console type, for example, *VNC* or *VMRC*.
Note that VNC consoles are unsupported on VMware ESXi 6.5 and later.
. Optional: In the *VNC Console Passwords* field, select the *Set a randomly generated password on the display connection* checkbox to secure console access for new hosts with a randomly generated password.
You can retrieve the password for the VNC console to access guest virtual machine console from the `libvirtd` host from the output of the following command:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# virsh edit _your_VM_name_
<graphics type='vnc' port='-1' autoport='yes' listen='0.0.0.0' passwd='_your_randomly_generated_password_'>
----
+
The password randomly generates every time the console for the virtual machine opens, for example, with virt-manager.
. From the *Enable Caching* list, you can select whether to enable caching of compute resources.
For more information, see xref:Caching_of_Compute_Resources_{context}[].
. Click the *Locations* and *Organizations* tabs and verify that the values are automatically set to your current context.
You can also add additional contexts.
. Click *Submit* to save the connection.

.CLI procedure
* Create the connection with the `hammer compute-resource create` command.
Select `Vmware` as the `--provider` and set the instance UUID of the data center as the `--uuid`:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# hammer compute-resource create \
--datacenter "_My_Datacenter_" \
--description "vSphere server at _vsphere.example.com_" \
--locations "_My_Location_" \
--name "My_vSphere" \
--organizations "_My_Organization_" \
--password "_My_Password_" \
--provider "Vmware" \
--server "_vsphere.example.com_" \
--user "_My_User_"

= Migrating {Project} to a New {EL} System

When you migrate your {Project}, you create a backup of your {ProjectServer} and your {SmartProxy}, install a fresh instance, and restore your backup on the new instance.
After your migration is complete, you can then decommission the earlier instance of {ProjectServer} and {SmartProxy}.

.Terminology
Ensure that you understand the following terms:

*Source server*:: The origin of migration on which you create a backup.

*Target server*:: The new server on which you restore the backup.

.High-Level Procedure
To migrate your {Project} to new hardware, follow these high-level steps:

. Create a backup of the {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer} on the source server.
. Perform a fresh installation of the {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer} on a target server.
* Install a minimal {EL} 8 instance with the capacity to store backup files.
* Do not install any operating system software groups or third-party applications.

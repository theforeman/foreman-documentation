[id="satellite-ports-and-firewalls-requirements_{context}"]
= Ports and Firewalls Requirements

For the components of {Project} architecture to communicate, ensure that the required network ports are open and free on the base operating system.
You must also ensure that the required network ports are open on any network-based firewalls.

Use this information to configure any network-based firewalls.
Note that some cloud solutions must be specifically configured to allow communications between machines because they isolate machines similarly to network-based firewalls.
If you use an application-based firewall, ensure that the application-based firewall permits all applications that are listed in the tables and known to your firewall.
If possible, disable the application checking and allow open port communication based on the protocol.

.Integrated {SmartProxy}
{ProjectServer} has an integrated {SmartProxy} and any host that is directly connected to {ProjectServer} is a Client of {Project} in the context of this section.
This includes the base operating system on which {SmartProxyServer} is running.

.Clients of {SmartProxy}
Hosts which are clients of {SmartProxies}, other than {Project}'s integrated {SmartProxy}, do not need access to {ProjectServer}.
For more information on {Project} Topology, see {PlanningDocURL}sect-Documentation-Architecture_Guide-Capsule_Networking[{SmartProxy} Networking] in _Planning for {ProjectNameX}_.

Required ports can change based on your configuration.

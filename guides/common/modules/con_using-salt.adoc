= Using Salt

Salt Minions managed by {Project} are associated with a Salt Master and a Salt Environment.
The associated Salt Environment within {Project} must match the actual Salt Environment from the `file_roots` option in the `/etc/salt/master` file.
You can configure managed hosts with Salt after they are associated with your {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer} and the Salt Minion client software is installed.

= {ProjectServer} with external database

When you install {Project}, the `{foreman-installer}` command creates databases on the same server that you install {Project}.
Depending on your requirements, moving to external databases can provide increased working memory for {Project}, which can improve response times for database operating requests.
Moving to external databases distributes the workload and can increase the capacity for performance tuning.

Consider using external databases if you plan to use your {Project} deployment for the following scenarios:

* Frequent remote execution tasks.
This creates a high volume of records in PostgreSQL and generates heavy database workloads.
* High disk I/O workloads from frequent repository synchronization or Content View publishing.
This causes {Project} to create a record in PostgreSQL for each job.
* High volume of hosts.
* High volume of synced content.

= Creating a Granular Permission Filter

Use this procedure to create a granular filter.
To use the CLI instead of the {ProjectWebUI}, see the xref:cli-creating-a-granular-permission-filter_{context}[].

{Project} does not apply search conditions to create actions.
For example, limiting the _create_locations_ action with _name = "Default Location"_ expression in the search field does not prevent the user from assigning a custom name to the newly created location.

.Procedure

Specify a query in the *Search* field on the *Edit Filter* page.
Deselect the *Unlimited* checkbox for the field to be active.
Queries have the following form:

[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
_field_name_ _operator_ _value_
----

* _field_name_ marks the field to be queried.
The range of available field names depends on the resource type.
For example, the _Partition Table_ resource type offers _family_, _layout_, and _name_ as query parameters.

* _operator_ specifies the type of comparison between _field_name_ and _value_.
See xref:Supported_Operators_for_Granular_Search_{context}[] for an overview of applicable operators.

* _value_ is the value used for filtering.
This can be for example a name of an organization.
Two types of wildcard characters are supported: underscore (_) provides single character replacement, while percent sign (%) replaces zero or more characters.

For most resource types, the *Search* field provides a drop-down list suggesting the available parameters.
This list appears after placing the cursor in the search field.
For many resource types, you can combine queries using logical operators such as _and_, _not_ and _has_ operators.

.CLI procedure

* To create a granular filter, enter the `hammer filter create` command with the `--search` option to limit permission filters, for example:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
# hammer filter create \
--permission-ids 91 \
--search "name ~ ccv*" \
--role qa-user
----

This command adds to the *qa-user* role a permission to view, create, edit, and destroy Content Views that only applies to Content Views with name starting with `ccv`.

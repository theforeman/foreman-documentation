= Configuring the HTTP Proxy to Connect to Red Hat CDN

Verify that {Project} can connect to the Red{nbsp}Hat CDN and can synchronize its repositories.

.Procedure

. On the network gateway and the HTTP Proxy, enable TCP for the following host names:
+
[cols="2,1,1",options="header"]
|====
| Host name | Port | Protocol
| subscription.rhsm.redhat.com | 443 | HTTPS
| cdn.redhat.com |  443 | HTTPS
| *.akamaiedge.net |  443 | HTTPS
| cert-api.access.redhat.com (if using Red{nbsp}Hat Insights) |  443 | HTTPS
| api.access.redhat.com (if using Red{nbsp}Hat Insights) |  443 | HTTPS
|====
+
{ProjectServer} uses SSL to communicate with the Red{nbsp}Hat CDN securely. Use of an SSL interception proxy interferes with this communication. These hosts must be whitelisted on the proxy.
+
For a list of IP addresses used by the Red{nbsp}Hat CDN (cdn.redhat.com), see the Knowledgebase article https://access.redhat.com/articles/1525183[Public CIDR Lists for Red{nbsp}Hat] on the Red{nbsp}Hat Customer Portal.
+
. On {ProjectServer}, complete the following details in the `/etc/rhsm/rhsm.conf` file:

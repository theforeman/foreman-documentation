= Installing and configuring {advisorengine} 

The {advisorengine} helps {RHEL} systems perform efficiently, keeping them secure and available.

It analyzes system health and configuration by applying predefined rules to a small set of local data, such as installed packages, running services, and configuration settings. 
When you deploy the Insights advisor engine locally on {Project}, you can generate Insights recommendations without sending system data to Red{nbsp}Hat services.

You can install and configure the Insights advisor on a disconnected {ProjectServer} by using either the {Project} installation ISO or a container image import and export.

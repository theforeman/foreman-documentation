= Creating objects by using Ruby

This script connects to the {ProjectNameX} API, creates an organization, and then creates three lifecycle environments in the organization.
If the organization already exists, the script uses that organization.
If any of the lifecycle environments already exist in the organization, the script raises an error and quits.

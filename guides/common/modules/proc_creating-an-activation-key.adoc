= Creating an activation key

Create an activation key to assign various attributes to hosts during registration.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Content* > *Lifecycle* > *Activation Keys* and click *Create Activation Key*.
. In the *Name* field, enter the name of the activation key.
. If you want to set a limit, clear the *Unlimited hosts* checkbox, and in the *Limit* field, enter the maximum number of systems you can register with the activation key.
If you want unlimited hosts to register with the activation key, ensure the *Unlimited Hosts* checkbox is selected.

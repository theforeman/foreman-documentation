= Creating an Activation Key

You can use activation keys to define a specific set of subscriptions to attach to hosts during registration.
The subscriptions that you add to an activation key must be available within the associated Content View.

Subscription Manager attaches subscriptions differently depending on the following factors:

* Are there any subscriptions associated with the activation key?
* Is the auto-attach option enabled?
* For {RHEL} 8 hosts: Is there system purpose set on the activation key?

Note that {Project} automatically attaches subscriptions only for the products installed on a host.
For subscriptions that do not list products installed on {RHEL} by default, such as the Extended Update Support (EUS) subscription, use an activation key specifying the required subscriptions and with the auto-attach disabled.

Based on the previous factors, there are three possible scenarios for subscribing with activation keys:

. Activation key that attaches subscriptions automatically.
+
With no subscriptions specified and auto-attach enabled, hosts using the activation key search for the best fitting subscription from the ones provided by the Content View associated with the activation key.
This is similar to entering the `subscription-manager --auto-attach` command.
For {RHEL} 8 hosts, you can configure the activation key to set system purpose on hosts during registration to enhance the automatic subscriptions attachment.
+
. Activation key providing a custom set of subscription for auto-attach.
+
If there are subscriptions specified and auto-attach is enabled, hosts using the activation key select the best fitting subscription from the list specified in the activation key.
Setting system purpose on the activation key does not affect this scenario.
+
. Activation key with the exact set of subscriptions.
+
If there are subscriptions specified and auto-attach is disabled, hosts using the activation key are associated with all subscriptions specified in the activation key.
Setting system purpose on the activation key does not affect this scenario.

.{customproducttitle}s
If a {customproduct}, typically containing content not provided by Red Hat, is assigned to an activation key, this product is always enabled for the registered content host regardless of the auto-attach setting.

To use the CLI instead of the {ProjectWebUI}, see the xref:cli-creating-an-activation-key_{context}[].

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Content* > *Activation keys* and click *Create Activation Key*.
. In the *Name* field, enter the name of the activation key.
. If you want to set a limit, clear the *Unlimited hosts* check box, and in the *Limit* field, enter the maximum number of systems you can register with the activation key.
If you want unlimited hosts to register with the activation key, ensure the *Unlimited Hosts* check box is selected.
. Optional: In the *Description* field, enter a description for the activation key.
. From the *Environment* list, select the environment to use.
. From the *Content View* list, select a Content View to use.
If you intend to use the deprecated `Katello Agent` instead of `Remote Execution`, the Content View must contain the {project-client-name} repository because it contains the `katello-agent` package.
ifndef::orcharhino[]
. If Simple Content Access (SCA) is not enabled:
.. Click the *Subscriptions* tab, then click the *Add* submenu.
.. Click the checkbox under the subscription you created before.
.. Click *Add Selected*.
. If SCA is enabled:
.. In the *Repository Sets* tab, ensure only your named repository is enabled.
endif::[]
. Click *Save*.
. Optional: For {RHEL} 8 hosts, in the *System Purpose* section, you can configure the activation key with system purpose to set on hosts during registration to enhance subscriptions auto attachment.

.CLI procedure
. Create the activation key:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# hammer activation-key create \
--name "_My_Activation_Key_" \
--unlimited-hosts \
--description "_Example Stack in the Development Environment_" \
--lifecycle-environment "_Development_" \
--content-view "_Stack_" \
--organization "_My_Organization_"
----
. Optional: For {RHEL} 8 hosts, enter the following command to configure the activation key with system purpose to set on hosts during registration to enhance subscriptions auto attachment.
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# hammer activation-key update \
--organization "_My_Organization_" \
--name "_My_Activation_Key_" \
--service-level "_Standard_" \
--purpose-usage "_Development/Test_" \
--purpose-role "_{RHELServer}_" \
--purpose-addons "_addons_"
----
. Obtain a list of your subscription IDs:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# hammer subscription list --organization "_My_Organization_"
----
. Attach the {RHEL} subscription UUID to the activation key:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# hammer activation-key add-subscription \
--name "_My_Activation_Key_" \
--subscription-id _My_Subscription_ID_ \
--organization "_My_Organization_"
----
. List the product content associated with the activation key:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# hammer activation-key product-content \
--name "_My_Activation_Key_" \
--organization "_My_Organization_"
----
. Override the default auto-enable status for the {project-client-name} repository.
The default status is set to disabled.
To enable, enter the following command:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# hammer activation-key content-override \
--name "_My_Activation_Key_" \

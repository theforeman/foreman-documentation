= Removing a virtual machine upon host deletion

By default, when you delete a host provisioned by {Project}, {Project} does not remove the actual VM on the compute resource.
You can configure {Project} to remove the VM when deleting the host entry on {Project}.

[NOTE]
====
If you do not remove the associated VM and attempt to create a new VM with the same FQDN later, it will fail because that VM already exists in the compute resource.
You can still re-register the existing VM to {Project}.
====

To use the CLI instead of the {ProjectWebUI}, see the xref:cli-removing-a-virtual-machine-upon-host-deletion_{context}[].

.Prerequisites
* Your {Project} account has a role that grants the `view_settings` and `edit_settings` permissions.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Administer* > *Settings* > *Provisioning*.
. Change the value of the *Destroy associated VM on host delete* setting to *Yes*.

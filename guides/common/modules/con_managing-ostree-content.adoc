= Managing OSTree Content

You can use OSTree to manage bootable, immutable, versioned file system trees.

OSTree makes it easy to install and update Linux-based operating systems on hosts and to switch between versions of operating systems on hosts.
If a host update fails, you can easily revert the operating system on the host to the previous working version.

You can create an OSTree image using an image builder and expose it in an OSTree repository on an HTTP server.
Then you can use your {Project} to synchronize and manage OSTree branches from the exposed OSTree repository.

.Prerequisites
* OSTree content is supported only when running {Project} on {EL} 8.
* In {ProjectServer}, OSTree management tools are not enabled by default.
To enable OSTree, enter the following command:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-installer} --foreman-proxy-content-enable-ostree=true
----
* If you want to use Hammer CLI, you must enable the `hammer-cli-katello` plugin on {ProjectServer}.

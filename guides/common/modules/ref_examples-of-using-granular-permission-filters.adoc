= Examples of using granular permission filters

[role="_abstract"]
As an administrator, you can allow selected users to make changes in a certain part of the environment path.
For example, you can allow users to work with content while it is in the development stage of the application lifecycle, but not once the content is pushed to production.

The following query applies any permissions specified for the Host resource type only to hosts in the group named host-editors:

[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
hostgroup = host-editors
----

The following query returns records where the name matches _XXXX_, _Yyyy_, or _zzzz_ example strings:

[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
name ^ (XXXX, Yyyy, zzzz)
----

You can also limit permissions to a selected environment.
To do so, specify the environment name in the *Search* field, for example:

[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
Dev
----

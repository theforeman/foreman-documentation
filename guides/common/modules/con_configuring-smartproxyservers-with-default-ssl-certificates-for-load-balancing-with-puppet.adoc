= Configuring {SmartProxyServers} with default SSL certificates for load balancing (with Puppet)

[role="_abstract"]
If you use Puppet in your {Project} setup, you can configure one or more {SmartProxyServers} that use default SSL certificates for load balancing.

To do this, you configure Puppet certificate signing on one of your {SmartProxyServers}.
Then, you configure each remaining Puppet {SmartProxy} used for load balancing to use the certificates.
The first {SmartProxyServer} will generate and sign Puppet certificates for the remaining {SmartProxies} configured for load balancing.

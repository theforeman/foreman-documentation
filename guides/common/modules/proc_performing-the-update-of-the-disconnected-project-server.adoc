If required, reboot the system to complete the update.

.Prerequisites

. Review the results and resolve any errors before proceeding with the update.
. Due to the lengthy update time, use a utility such as `tmux` to suspend and resume the session as needed.
By using such utility, you can monitor progress without maintaining a continuous connection to the command shell.
+
If the update process is interrupted, check the `{installer-log-file}` file to confirm whether the process completed successfully.
. Perform the update:

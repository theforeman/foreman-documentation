[[sect-Mapping_the_Infrastructure_Topology]]
= Locations and topology

This section outlines general considerations that should help you to specify your {Project} deployment scenario.
The most common deployment scenarios are listed in xref:chap-Architecture_Guide-Deployment_Scenarios[].
The defining questions are:


* *How many {SmartProxyServers} do I need?* – The number of geographic locations where your organization operates should translate to the number of {SmartProxyServers}.
By assigning a {SmartProxy} to each location, you decrease the load on {ProjectServer}, increase redundancy, and reduce bandwidth usage.
{ProjectServer} itself can act as a {SmartProxy} (it contains an integrated {SmartProxy} by default).
This can be used in single location deployments and to provision the base system's of {SmartProxyServers}.
Using the integrated {SmartProxy} to communicate with hosts in remote locations is not recommended as it can lead to suboptimal network utilization.

* *What services will be provided by {SmartProxyServers}?* – After establishing the number of {SmartProxies}, decide what services will be enabled on each {SmartProxy}.
Even though the whole stack of content and configuration management capabilities is available, some infrastructure services (DNS, DHCP, TFTP) can be outside of a {Project} administrator's control.
In such case, {SmartProxies} have to integrate with those external services (see xref:sect-Architecture_Guide-Capsule_with_External_Services[]).

* *Is my {ProjectServer} required to be disconnected from the Internet?* – Disconnected {Project} is a common deployment scenario (see xref:sect-Architecture_Guide-Disconnected_Satellite[]).
If you require frequent updates of Red{nbsp}Hat content on a disconnected {Project}, plan an additional {Project} instance for {ISS}.
endif::[]

* *What compute resources do I need for my hosts?* – Apart from provisioning bare-metal hosts, you can use various compute resources supported by {Project}.
To learn about provisioning on different compute resources see {ProvisioningDocURL}[_{ProvisioningDocTitle}_].

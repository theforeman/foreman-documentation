= Configuring {ProjectServer} to synchronize content over a network by using {ProjectWebUI}

[role="_abstract"]
Configure a downstream {ProjectServer} to synchronize repositories from a connected upstream {ProjectServer} over HTTPS by using the {ProjectWebUI}.

.Prerequisites
* A network connection exists between the upstream {ProjectServer} and the downstream {ProjectServer}.
* You imported the same subscription manifest on both the upstream and downstream {ProjectServer}.
For more information, see xref:Importing_a_Red_Hat_Subscription_Manifest_into_Server_{context}[].
* On the upstream {ProjectServer}, you enabled the required repositories for the organization.
For more information, see {ContentManagementDocURL}enabling-red-hat-repositories-by-using-web-ui[Enabling Red Hat Repositories] in _{ContentManagementDocTitle}_.
* The upstream user is an admin or has the following permissions:
** `view_organizations`
** `view_products`
** `export_content`
** `view_lifecycle_environments`
** `view_content_views`
* On the downstream {ProjectServer}, you have imported the SSL certificate of the upstream {ProjectServer} using the contents of `http://_upstream-{foreman-example-com}_/pub/katello-server-ca.crt`.
For more information, see {ContentManagementDocURL}importing-custom-ssl-certificates-by-using-web-ui[Importing SSL Certificates] in _{ContentManagementDocTitle}_.
* The downstream user is an admin or has the permissions to create product repositories and organizations.

= Required boot order for network boot

[role="_abstract"]
This requirement applies to physical and virtual machines that you want to provision in {ProjectName}.

Machines with BIOS interface::
The first booting device: network
+
The second booting device: hard drive
+
When {Project} manages TFTP boot configuration files, hosts can be provisioned by rebooting.

Machines with UEFI interface::
The first booting device: network
+
Depending on the UEFI firmware type and configuration, the operating system installer configures the operating system boot loader as the first entry.
+
You can reboot back into the installer by using the `efibootmgr` utility to switch back to booting from network.

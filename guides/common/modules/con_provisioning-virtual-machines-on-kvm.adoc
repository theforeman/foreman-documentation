= Provisioning Virtual Machines on KVM (libvirt)

:context: kvm-provisioning
:kvm-provisioning:
:CRname: KVM

Kernel-based Virtual Machines (KVMs) use an open source virtualization daemon and API called `libvirt` running on {RHEL}.
{ProjectName} can connect to the `libvirt` API on a KVM server, provision hosts on the hypervisor, and control certain virtualization functions.

Only Virtual Machines created through {Project} can be managed.
Virtual Machines with other than directory storage pool types are unsupported.

You can use KVM provisioning to create hosts over a network connection or from an existing image.

.Prerequisites
include::snip_common-compute-resource-prereqs.adoc[]
* A {SmartProxyServer} managing a network on the KVM server.
Ensure no other DHCP services run on this network to avoid conflicts with {SmartProxyServer}.
For more information about network service configuration for {SmartProxyServer}s, see {ProvisioningDocURL}Configuring_Networking_provisioning[Configuring Networking] in the _Provisioning_ guide.

* A {RHEL} server running KVM virtualization tools (libvirt daemon).
For more information, see the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html-single/virtualization_getting_started_guide/[{RHEL} 7 Virtualization Getting Started Guide].

ifndef::satellite[]
* A server running KVM virtualization tools (libvirt daemon).
* A virtual network running on the libvirt server.
Only NAT and isolated virtual networks can be managed through {Project}.
endif::[]
* An existing virtual machine image if you want to use image-based provisioning.
Ensure that this image exists in a storage pool on the KVM host.
The `default` storage pool is usually located in `/var/lib/libvirt/images`.
Only directory pool storage types can be managed through {Project}.
* Optional: The examples in these procedures use the root user for KVM.
If you want to use a non-root user on the KVM server, you must add the user to the `libvirt` group on the KVM server:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
useradd -a -G libvirt _non_root_user_
----

* A {Project} user account with the following roles:
** *Edit hosts*
** *View hosts*
+
For more information, see {AdministeringDocURL}Assigning_Roles_to_a_User_admin[Assigning Roles to a User] in the _Administering {ProjectName}_ guide.
* A custom role in {Project} with the following permissions:
** *view_compute_resources*
** *destroy_compute_resources_vms*
** *power_compute_resources_vms*
** *create_compute_resources_vms*
** *view_compute_resources_vms*
** *view_locations*
** *view_subnets*
+
For more information about creating roles, see {AdministeringDocURL}Creating_a_Role_admin[Creating a Role] in the _Administering {ProjectName}_ guide.
For more information about adding permissions to a role, see {AdministeringDocURL}Adding_Permissions_to_a_Role_admin[Adding Permissions to a Role] in the _Administering {ProjectName}_ guide.

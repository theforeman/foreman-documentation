= Adding installation media to {Project} by using Hammer CLI

[role="_abstract"]
Installation media are sources of packages that {Project} uses to install a base operating system on a machine from an external repository.
ifdef::foreman-el,katello[]
When you install the Katello plugin, you can download packages from a Pulp mirror.
In this case, installation media are ignored.
endif::[]
ifdef::satellite[]
You can use this parameter to install third-party content.
Content to provision {RHEL} hosts is delivered through Kickstart repositories.
endif::[]

You can view installation media by navigating to *Hosts* > *Provisioning Setup* > *Installation Media*.

Installation media must be in the format of an operating system installation tree and must be accessible from the machine hosting the installer through an HTTP URL.

[NOTE]
====
Other protocols, such as HTTPS or NFS, are known to work but have not been tested.
{Team} recommends using HTTP.

You can hypothetically use NFS share for PXE-based provisioning in a semi-automated way by copying the `initrd.img` and `vmlinuz` files from the NFS source to `/var/lib/tftpboot/boot` on {SmartProxy} with the expected names.
Only then PXE booting can proceed further.

endif::[]

ifndef::orcharhino[]
By default, {Project} includes installation media for some official Linux distributions.
Note that some of those installation media are targeted for a specific version of an operating system.
For example *CentOS mirror (7.x)* must be used for CentOS 7 or earlier, and *CentOS mirror (8.x)* must be used for CentOS 8 or later.
endif::[]

If you want to improve download performance when using installation media to install operating systems on multiple hosts, you must modify the *Path* of the installation medium to point to the closest mirror or a local copy.

= Distributing Archived Content View Versions

The setting **Distribute archived content view versions** allows the hosting of archived Content View version repositories to be exposed for consumption.
This is useful while debugging to see what content is present in your Content View versions.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Administer* > *Settings*.
. Click the *Content* tab.
. Set the *Distribute archived content view versions* parameter to *Yes*.

This enables the repositories of Content View versions without lifecycle environments to be distributed at `{foreman-example-com}/pulp/content/_My_Organization_/content_views/_My_Content_View_/_My_Content_View_Version_/`.

[NOTE]
====
Older non-promoted Content View versions are not distributed once the setting is enabled.
Only new Content View versions become distributed.

[role="_abstract"]
The setting *Distribute archived content view versions* enables hosting of non-promoted content view version repositories in the {Project} content web application along with other repositories.

.Procedure

. Click the *Content* tab.
. Set the *Distribute archived content view versions* parameter to *Yes*.
. Click *Submit*.

This enables the repositories of content view versions without lifecycle environments to be distributed at `{foreman-example-com}/pulp/content/_My_Organization_/content_views/_My_Content_View_/_My_Content_View_Version_/`.

[NOTE]
====
Older non-promoted content view versions are not distributed once the setting is enabled.
Only new content view versions become distributed.

= Disaster recovery with active and passive {ProjectServer} and external storage

In this scenario, you maintain two {ProjectServer}s and you store critical data externally on network-attached storage (NAS).
The primary server is active while the secondary server remains passive.
If the primary server fails, you attach the NAS to your secondary server and turn it into your new primary server.

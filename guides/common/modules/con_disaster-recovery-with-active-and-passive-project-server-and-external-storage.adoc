= Disaster recovery with active and passive {ProjectServer} and external storage

To prepare for disaster recovery, you can configure two {ProjectServer}s and store critical data externally on shared storage.
The primary server is active while the secondary server remains passive.
If the primary server fails, the shared storage is attached to your secondary server, which turns the secondary server into your new primary server.

= Configuring DNS, DHCP, and TFTP

If you want to manage DNS, DHCP, and TFTP centrally within the {Project} environment, you can configure the services directly on the {ProjectServer}.
You can also manage the services manually, which involves disabling their maintenance on {Project} and configuring them independently.

Or you can run the services externally, outside of the {Project} environment.

= Introduction to application lifecycle

[role="_abstract"]
The _application lifecycle_ is a concept central to {Project}'s content management functions.
The application lifecycle defines how a particular system and its software look at a particular stage.
For example, an application lifecycle might be simple; you might only have a development stage and production stage.
In this case the application lifecycle might look like this:

* Development
* Production

However, a more complex application lifecycle might have further stages, such as a phase for testing or a beta release.
This adds extra stages to the application lifecycle:

* Development
* Testing
* Beta Release
* Production

{Project} provides methods to customize each application lifecycle stage so that it suits your specifications.

Each stage in the application lifecycle is called an _environment_ in {Project}.
Each environment uses a specific collection of content.
{Project} defines these content collections as a content view.
Each content view acts as a filter where you can define what repositories, and packages to include in a particular environment.
This provides a method for you to define specific sets of content to designate to each environment.

For example, an email server might only require a simple application lifecycle where you have a production-level server for real-world use and a test server for trying out the latest mail server packages.
When the test server passes the initial phase, you can set the production-level server to use the new packages.

Another example is a development lifecycle for a software product.
To develop a new piece of software in a development environment, test it in a quality assurance environment, pre-release as a beta, then release the software as a production-level application.

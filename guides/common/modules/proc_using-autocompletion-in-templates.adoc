= Using Autocompletion in Templates

You can access a list of available macros and usage information in the template editor with the autocompletion option.
This works for all templates within {Project}.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to either *Hosts* > *Partition tables*, *Hosts* > *Templates* > *Provisioning Templates*, or *Hosts* > *Templates* > *Job templates*.
. Click the *settings* icon at the top right corner of the template editor and select *Autocompletion*.
. Press `*Ctrl*` + `*Space*` in the template editor to access a list of all available macros.
You can narrow down the list of macros by typing in more information about what you are looking for.
For example, if you are looking for a method to list the ID of the content source for a host, you can type `host` and check the list of available macros for content source.
. A window next to the dropdown provides a description of the macro, its usage, and the value it will return.
. When you find the method you are looking for, hit `Enter` to input the method.

You can also enable *Live Autocompletion* in the *settings* menu to view a list of macros that match the pattern whenever you type something.
However, this might input macros in unintended places, like package names in a provisioning template.

Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is a set of open protocols used to access centrally stored information over a network.
With {Project}, you can use one or multiple LDAP directories for external authentication.

[NOTE]
====
While you can configure the LDAP server integrated with {FreeIPA} as an external authentication source, {FreeIPA} users will not be able to log in using single sign-on.
Instead, consider configuring {FreeIPA} as an external identity provider.
For more information, see xref:configuring-{Freeipa-context}-server-as-an-external-identity-provider-for-project_{context}[].
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Users cannot use both {FreeIPA} and LDAP as an authentication method.
After a user authenticates by using one of these methods, they cannot use the other method.

To change the authentication method for a user, remove the automatically created user from {Project}.

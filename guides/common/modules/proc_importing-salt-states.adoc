= Importing Salt States

[role="_abstract"]
A Salt State configures parts of a host, for example, a service or the installation of a package.
You can import Salt States from your Salt Master to {Project}.
The Salt Master configuration in this guide uses a Salt Environment called `base` that includes the Salt States stored in `/srv/salt/`.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Configure* > *Salt* > *States*.
. Click *Import from FQDN*.
. Optional: Click *Edit* to assign Salt States to Salt Environments.
. Optional: Click *Delete* to remove a Salt State from your {Project}.
This only removes the Salt State from {Project}, not from the disk of your Salt Master.
. Click *Submit* to import the Salt States.
. Optional: After you have imported Salt States, you can assign them to hosts or Host Groups.
Salt applies these Salt States to any hosts they are assigned to every time you run `state.highstate`.
For more information, see xref:Running_Salt_{context}[].
. Configure the paths for Salt States and Salt Pillars in `/etc/salt/master`.
By default, Salt States are located in `/srv/salt` and and Salt Pillars in `/srv/pillar`.

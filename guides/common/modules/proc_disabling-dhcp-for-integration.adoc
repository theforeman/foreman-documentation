= Disabling DHCP for integration

If you want to manually manage a DHCP service, you must prevent {Project} from maintaining this service on the operating system and disable orchestration to avoid errors.

[NOTE]
====
Disabling DHCP in {Project} does not remove the related backend service on the operating system.

.Prerequisites

* You are logged in to the {ProjectWebUI}.


.Procedure

. Navigate to *Infrastructure* > *Subnets*.

. For each subnet that is associated with the DHCP {SmartProxy}:

.. Select the subnet.

.. On the *{SmartProxies}* tab, clear the *DHCP {SmartProxy}* field.

.. Click *Submit*.

. On {ProjectServer} and {SmartProxyServer}, enter:

[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-installer} --foreman-proxy-dhcp false
----


[NOTE]
====
{Project} does not perform orchestration when a {SmartProxy} is not set for a given subnet.
When you disable {SmartProxy} associations, orchestration commands for existing hosts can fail if the expected records and configuration files are not present.

= Creating hosts with PXE-less provisioning

Some hardware does not provide a PXE boot interface.
In {Project}, you can provision a host without PXE boot.
This is also known as PXE-less provisioning and involves generating a boot ISO that hosts can use.
Using this ISO, the host can connect to {ProjectServer}, boot the installation media, and install the operating system.

{Project} also provides a PXE-less discovery service that operates without PXE-based services, such as DHCP and TFTP.
For more information, see xref:discovery-in-pxeless-mode[].

.Boot ISO types

There are the following types of boot ISOs:

ifndef::satellite[]
Host image::
A boot ISO for the specific host.
This image contains only the boot files that are necessary to access the installation media on {ProjectServer}.
The user defines the subnet data in {Project} and the image is created with static networking.
The image is based on iPXE boot firmware, only a limited number of network cards is supported.
endif::[]

Full host image::
A boot ISO that contains the kernel and initial RAM disk image for the specific host.
This image is useful if the host fails to chainload correctly.
The provisioning template still downloads from {ProjectServer}.

ifndef::satellite[]
Generic image::
A boot ISO that is not associated with a specific host.
The ISO sends the host's MAC address to {ProjectServer}, which matches it against the host entry.
The image does not store IP address details and requires access to a DHCP server on the network to bootstrap.
This image is also available from the `/disks/generic` URL on your {ProjectServer}, for example, `\https://{foreman-example-com}/disks/generic`.
endif::[]

Subnet image::
A boot ISO that is not associated with a specific host.
The ISO sends the host's MAC address to {SmartProxyServer}, which matches it against the host entry.
The image does not store IP address details and requires access to a DHCP server on the network to bootstrap.
This image is generic to all hosts with a provisioning NIC on the same subnet.
The image is based on iPXE boot firmware, only a limited number of network cards is supported.

[NOTE]
====
The *Full host image* is based on SYSLINUX and Grub and works with most network cards.

ifndef::satellite[]

see https://ipxe.org/appnote/hardware_drivers[supported hardware on ipxe.org] for a list of network card drivers expected to work with an iPXE-based boot disk.

ifdef::satellite[]
*Full host image* contains a provisioning token, therefore the generated image has limited lifespan.
endif::[]
ifndef::satellite[]
*Host image* and *Full host image* contain provisioning tokens, therefore the generated image has limited lifespan.
endif::[]
For more information about configuring security tokens, read xref:configuring-the-security-token-validity-duration[].

. Click the *Operating System* tab, and verify that all fields contain values.
Confirm each aspect of the operating system.
. Click *Resolve* in *Provisioning Templates* to check the new host can identify the right provisioning templates to use.

For more information about associating provisioning templates, see xref:provisioning-templates[].

. Click *Submit* to save the host details.
This creates a host entry and the host details page appears.
. Download the boot disk from {ProjectServer}.
+
ifndef::satellite[]
* For *Host image*, on the host details page, click the vertical ellipsis and select *Host '_My_Host_Name_' image*.
endif::[]
* For *Full host image*, on the host details page, click the vertical ellipsis and select *Full host '_My_Host_Name_' image*.
ifndef::satellite[]
* For *Generic image*, navigate to *Infrastructure* > *Subnets*, click *Boot disk* and select *Generic image*.
endif::[]
* For *Subnet image*, navigate to *Infrastructure* > *Subnets*, click the dropdown menu in the *Actions* column of the required subnet and select *Subnet generic image*.
. Write the ISO to a USB storage device using the `dd` utility or `livecd-tools` if required.
. When you start the host and boot from the ISO or the USB storage device, the host connects to {ProjectServer} and starts installing operating system from its Kickstart tree.
ifdef::satellite,katello,orcharhino[]
+
When the installation completes, the host also registers to {ProjectServer} using the activation key and installs the necessary configuration and management tools from the *{project-client-name}* repository.

This creates a boot ISO for your host to use.
. Write the ISO to a USB storage device using the `dd` utility or `livecd-tools` if required.
. When you start the physical host and boot from the ISO or the USB storage device, the host connects to {ProjectServer} and starts installing operating system from its Kickstart tree.

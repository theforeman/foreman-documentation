= How content view environments are handled during registration with multiple activation keys

Registering a host with multiple activation keys assigns different attributes from each key, and their combined settings determine the host's configuration.
Note that multiple activation keys and multiple content view environments are not the same.
Activation keys assign specific attributes to hosts during registration.
For instance, one activation key assigns system purpose attributes, another assigns repository set content overrides, and a third assigns the host's content view environments.
When you register a host with these three activation keys, it inherits the system purpose attributes, content overrides, and content view environments from all the keys combined.

When multiple activation keys assign the same attributes, {Project} decides how to resolve conflicts.
In general, the host receives the union of non-conflicting settings and the setting from the last activation key for conflicting settings.

Conflicting settings (where the setting from the last activation key wins) include:

* System purpose attributes
* Release version

Non-conflicting settings (where the host receives the union of them) include:

* Host collections

Activation key behavior regarding multiple content view environments depends on the `allow_multiple_content_views` setting.
If you enable `allow_multiple_content_views`, content view environments are treated as non-conflicting.
If you disable `allow_multiple_content_views`, content view environments are considered conflicting.

When you enable `allow_multiple_content_views` and register a host with multiple activation keys, the host receives all content view environments from each activation key, in the order they are passed.
For example:

* Activation key `ak_multi` assigns content view environments `dev/cv2`, `dev/cv3`.
* Activation key `ak4` assigns content view environments `dev/cv4`.

A host registered with activation keys `ak_multi` and `ak4` receives content view environments `dev/cv2`, `dev/cv3`, and `dev/cv4`.
If the order is reversed, with `ak4` followed by `ak_multi`, the host receives content view environments `dev/cv4`, `dev/cv2`, and `dev/cv3`.

When you disable `allow_multiple_content_views` and register a host with multiple activation keys, the host receives the content view environments from the last activation key with any content view environments.
If any of the activation keys is a multi-environment activation key, registration fails with an error, regardless of the order.

For example:

* Activation key `ak_multi` assigns content view environments `dev/cv2`, `dev/cv3`.
* Activation key `ak4` assigns content view environment `dev/cv4`.
* Activation key `ak5` assigns content view environment `dev/cv5`.
* Activation key `ak_none` assigns no content view environments.

If you attempt to register a host with activation keys `ak_multi`, `ak4`, registration fails because `ak_multi` is a multi-environment activation key.

If you register a host with activation keys `ak4`, `ak5`, the host receives `dev/cv5`, as `ak5` is the last activation key with content view environments.

If you register a host with activation keys `ak4`, `ak5`, `ak_none`, the host receives `dev/cv5` because `ak5` is the last activation key with content view environments.

If you register a host with activation keys `ak5`, `ak4`, the host receives `dev/cv4`, as `ak4` is the last activation key with content view environments.

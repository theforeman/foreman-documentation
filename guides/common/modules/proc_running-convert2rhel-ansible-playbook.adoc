= Running the Convert2RHEL Ansible Playbook

Use this procedure to install Convert2RHEL and perform the conversion.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Hosts > All Hosts* and select the target hosts on which you want to execute the remote job.
You can use the search field to filter the host list.
. From the *Select Action* list, select *Schedule Remote Job*.
. On the *Job invocation page*, define the main job settings:
. Select the *Job category* and the *Job template* to use.
Use Convert2RHEL for both.
. Optional: Select a stored search string in the *Bookmark* list to specify the target hosts.
. Optional: Limit the targeted hosts by entering a *Search query*.
The *Resolves to* line displays the number of hosts affected by your query.
Use the refresh button to recalculate the number after changing the query.
The preview icon lists the targeted hosts.
. In the *Activation Key* field, select the activation key associated with the conversion you are doing.
you must choose either `convert2rhel_rhel7` or `convert2rhel_rhel8`.
. Check *Restart* if you want to restart the machine after the conversion is complete.
The remaining settings might not display when you select the Convert2RHEL template.

. Optional: To configure advanced settings for the job, click *Display advanced fields*.
Some of the advanced settings depend on the job template, the following settings are general:
* *Effective user* defines the user for executing the job, by default it is the SSH user.
* *Concurrency level* defines the maximum number of jobs executed at once, which can prevent overload of systems' resources in a case of executing the job on a large number of hosts.
* *Timeout to kill* defines time interval in seconds after which the job should be killed, if it is not finished already. A task which could not be started during the defined interval, for example, if the previous task took too long to finish, is canceled.
+
*Concurrency level* and *Timeout to kill* settings enable you to tailor job execution to fit your infrastructure hardware and needs.

* *Type of query* defines when the search query is evaluated.
This helps to keep the query up to date for scheduled tasks.
* *Execution ordering* determines the order in which the job is executed on hosts: alphabetical or randomized.
. Optional: From the *Type of query* field, check *Static query* or *Dynamic query*.
. To run the job immediately, ensure that *Schedule* is set to *Execute now*. You can also define a one-time future job, or set up a recurring job. For recurring tasks, you can define start and end dates, number and frequency of runs.
. Click *Submit*. This displays the *Job Overview* page, and when the job completes, also displays the status of the job.
. Note that:
* The conversion can take some time.
* During the conversion, the host reboots.
* After the reboot, new OS facts are sent to {Project}.
* When complete, the OS for the host changes to {RHEL} and the subscription status turns green.

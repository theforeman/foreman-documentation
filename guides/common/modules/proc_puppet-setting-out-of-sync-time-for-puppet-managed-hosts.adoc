= Setting Out of Sync Time for Puppet Managed Hosts

{Project} considers hosts managed by Puppet to be out of sync if the last Puppet report is older than the combined values of `outofsync_interval` and `puppet_interval` set in minutes.
By default, the Puppet agent on managed hosts runs every 30 minutes.
The `puppet_interval` is set to 35 minutes and the global `outofsync_interval` is set to 30 minutes.

The effective time after which hosts are considered out of sync is the sum of `outofsync_interval` and `puppet_interval`.
Setting the global `outofsync_interval` to 30 and the `puppet_interval` to 60 results in a total of 90 minutes after which the host status changes to `out of sync`.

By creating a compliance policy, you can define and plan your security compliance requirements, and ensure that your hosts remain compliant to your security policies.

.Prerequisites
* You have configured {Project} for your selected xref:common/modules/ref_compliance-policy-deployment-options.adoc#compliance-policy-deployment-options_{context}[compliance policy deployment method].
* You have available SCAP contents, and eventually tailoring files, in {Project}.
** To verify what SCAP contents are available by using {ProjectWebUI}, see xref:common/modules/proc_listing-available-scap-contents-using-web-ui.adoc#listing-available-scap-contents-using-web-ui[].
** To verify what SCAP contents are available by using CLI, see xref:common/modules/proc_listing-available-scap-contents-using-cli.adoc#listing-available-scap-contents-using-cli[].
** To upload SCAP contents and tailoring files, see xref:common/modules/con_configuring-scap-contents.adoc#Configuring_SCAP_Contents_{context}[].
* Your user account has a role assigned that has the `view_policies` and `create_policies` permissions.

* If you select *Monthly*, also specify the desired day of the month in the *Day of month* field.

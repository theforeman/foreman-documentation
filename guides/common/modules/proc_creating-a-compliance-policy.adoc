= Creating a Compliance Policy

Use this procedure to create a compliance policy, which you can use to ensure that your hosts remain compliant to your security policies.

.Prerequisites
* You have configured {Project} for your selected xref:compliance-policy-deployment-options_{context}[compliance policy deployment method].
* You have available SCAP contents, and eventually tailoring files, in {Project}.
** To verify what SCAP contents are available, see xref:listing-available-scap-contents_{context}[].
** To upload SCAP contents and tailoring files, see xref:Configuring_SCAP_Contents_{context}[].
* Your user account has the `view_policies` and `create_policies` permissions.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Hosts* > *Compliance {endash} Policies*.
. Select the deployment method: *Ansible*, *Puppet*, or *Manual*.
Then click *Next*.
. Enter a name for this policy, a description (optional), then click *Next*.
. Select the *SCAP Content* and *XCCDF Profile* to be applied, then click *Next*.
+
Note that {Project} does not detect whether the selected XCCDF profile contains any rules.
An empty XCCDF profile, such as the `Default XCCDF Profile`, will return empty reports.
. Optional: To customize the XCCDF profile, select a *Tailoring File* and a *XCCDF Profile in Tailoring File*, then click *Next*.
. Specify the scheduled time when the policy is to be applied.
Select *Weekly*, *Monthly*, or *Custom* from the *Period* list.
The *Custom* option allows for greater flexibility in the policy's schedule.

* If you select *Weekly*, also select the desired day of the week from the *Weekday* list.
* If you select *Monthly*, also specify the desired day of the month in the *Day of month* field.
* If you select *Custom*, enter a valid Cron expression in the *Cron line* field.
. Select the locations to which the policy is to be applied, then click *Next*.
. Select the organizations to which the policy is to be applied, then click *Next*.
. Optional: Select the host groups to which the policy is to be assigned.
. Click *Submit*.

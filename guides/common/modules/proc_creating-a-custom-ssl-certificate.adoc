= Creating a custom SSL certificate for {ProductName}

ifeval::["{context}" == "{project-context}"]
Use this procedure to create a custom SSL certificate for {ProductName}.
If you already have a custom SSL certificate for {ProductName}, skip this procedure.
endif::[]

ifeval::["{context}" == "{smart-proxy-context}"]
On {ProjectServer}, create a custom certificate for your {ProductName}.
If you already have a custom SSL certificate for {ProductName}, skip this procedure.
endif::[]

ifdef::load-balancing[]
On each {SmartProxyServer} you want to configure for load balancing, create a configuration file for the Certificate Signing Request and include the load balancer and {SmartProxyServer} as Subject Alternative Names (SAN).
endif::[]

.Procedure
. To store all the source certificate files, create a directory that is accessible only to the `root` user:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# mkdir /root/{cert-name}_cert
----
. Create a private key with which to sign the certificate signing request (CSR).
+
Note that the private key must be unencrypted.
If you use a password-protected private key, remove the private key password.
+
If you already have a private key for this {ProductName}, skip this step.
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# openssl genrsa -out `/root/{cert-name}_cert/{cert-name}_cert_key.pem` 4096
----

ifndef::load-balancing[]
. Create the `/root/{cert-name}_cert/openssl.cnf` configuration file for the CSR and include the following content:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
[ req ]
req_extensions = v3_req
distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name
prompt = no

[ req_distinguished_name ]
commonName = _{ssl-common-name}_

[ v3_req ]
basicConstraints = CA:FALSE
keyUsage = digitalSignature, keyEncipherment
extendedKeyUsage = serverAuth, clientAuth
subjectAltName = @alt_names

[ alt_names ]
DNS.1 = _{ssl-common-name}_ 
----
endif::[]

ifdef::load-balancing[]
. Create the `/root/{cert-name}_cert/openssl.cnf` configuration file for the CSR and include the following content:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
[ req ]
req_extensions = v3_req
distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name
x509_extensions = usr_cert
prompt = no

[ req_distinguished_name ]
commonName = _{ssl-common-name}_

[ v3_req ]
basicConstraints = CA:FALSE
keyUsage = digitalSignature, keyEncipherment
extendedKeyUsage = serverAuth, clientAuth
subjectAltName = @alt_names

[alt_names]
DNS.1 = _{loadbalancer-example-com}_
DNS.2 = _{smartproxy-example-com}_
----
+
The options used in the configuration file include the following:
+
`commonName`::
The certificate common name.
It must match the FQDN of {SmartProxyServer}.
Ensure to change this when running the command on each {SmartProxyServer} that you configure for load balancing.
You can also set a wildcard value `*`.
`[alt_names]`::
The alternative names for the load balancer and {SmartProxyServer}.
Include the FQDN of the load balancer as `DNS.1` and the FQDN of {SmartProxyServer} as `DNS.2`.
endif::[]
+
For more information about the `[ v3_req ]` parameters and their purpose, see link:https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5280[RFC 5280: Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile].
. Optional: If you want to add Distinguished Name (DN) details to the CSR, add the following information to the `[ req_distinguished_name ]` section:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
[req_distinguished_name]
CN = _{ssl-common-name}_
countryName = _My_Country_Name_
stateOrProvinceName = _My_State_Or_Province_Name_
localityName = _My_Locality_Name_
organizationName = _My_Organization_Or_Company_Name_
organizationalUnitName = _My_Organizational_Unit_Name_
----
+
The options used in the configuration file include the following:
+
`countryName`::
The country represented by a two-letter code
`stateOrProvinceName`::
Full name of the state or province
`localityName`::
Full name of the locality (example: New York)
`organizationalUnitName`::
Division responsible for the certificate (example: IT department)
. Generate CSR:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# openssl req -new \
-key _/root/{cert-name}_cert/{cert-name}_cert_key.pem_ \
-config _/root/{cert-name}_cert/openssl.cnf_ \
-out _/root/{cert-name}_cert/{cert-name}_cert_csr.pem_
----
+
The options used in the configuration file include the following:
+
`-key`::
Path to the private key
`-config`::
Path to the configuration file
`-out`::
Path to the CSR to generate
. Send the certificate signing request to the certificate authority (CA).
The same CA must sign certificates for {ProjectServer} and {SmartProxyServer}.
+
When you submit the request, specify the lifespan of the certificate.
The method for sending the certificate request varies, so consult the CA for the preferred method.
In response to the request, you can expect to receive a CA bundle and a signed certificate, in separate files.
ifdef::load-balancing[]
. Copy the Certificate Authority bundle and {SmartProxyServer} certificate file that you receive from the Certificate Authority, and {SmartProxyServer} private key to your {ProjectServer}.

= Hammer CLI overview

You can configure and manage your {ProjectServer} with CLI commands by using Hammer.

Using Hammer has the following benefits:

* Create shell scripts based on Hammer commands for basic task automation.
* Redirect output from Hammer to other tools.
* Use the `--debug` option with Hammer to test responses to API calls before applying the API calls in a script.
For example: `hammer --debug organization list`.

To issue Hammer commands, a user must have access to your {ProjectServer}.

[NOTE]
====
To ensure a user-friendly and intuitive experience, the {ProjectWebUI} takes priority when developing new functionality.
Therefore, some features that are available in the {ProjectWebUI} might not yet be available for Hammer.
====

In the background, each Hammer command first establishes a binding to the API, then sends a request.
This can have performance implications when executing a large number of Hammer commands in sequence.
In contrast, scripts that use API commands communicate directly with the Satellite API and they establish the binding only once.

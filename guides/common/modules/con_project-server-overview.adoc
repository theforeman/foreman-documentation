= {ProjectServerTitle} Overview

The {ProjectServer} is the central component of a {Project} deployment where you plan and manage the content life cycle.

A typical {Project} deployment includes one {ProjectServer} on which you perform the following operations:

* Content life cycle management
* Configuration of {SmartProxyServers} and managed hosts through GUI, CLI, and API
* System provisioning
* Patch management
* Subscription management

The {ProjectServer} delegates content distribution, host provisioning, and communication to the {SmartProxyServers}.
The {ProjectServer} itself also includes a default, integrated {SmartProxyServer}.

{ProjectServer} also contains a fine-grained authentication system.
You can grant {Project} operators permissions to access precisely the parts of the infrastructure for which they are responsible.

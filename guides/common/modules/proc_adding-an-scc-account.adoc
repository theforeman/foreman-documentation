= Adding an SCC Account to {Project}

Use the following procedure to add your SCC account to {Project}.
To use the CLI instead of the {ProjectWebUI}, see the xref:cli-Adding_an_SCC_Account_to_Server_{context}[].

.Prerequisite
* You have installed the SCC Manager plug-in on your {Project}.
For more information, see xref:Installing_the_SCC_Manager_Plugin_{context}[].

.Procedure
. Optional: In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Content* > *Content Credentials* and click *Create Content Credential*.
+
Add the GPG public key for SLES 15 SP3 from https://www.suse.com/support/security/keys/[suse.com].
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Content* > *SUSE Subscriptions*.
. Click *Add SCC Account*.
. In the *Name* field, enter a name for your SCC account in {Project}.
. In the *Login* and *Password* fields, enter your SUSE credentials.
. In the *Base URL* field, you can enter the base URL for the Suse Customer Center.
By default, it is set to `\https://scc.suse.com`.
. Optional: Set a *Sync interval* to periodically update the SCC authentication tokens.
Note that this does not refer to synchronizing content to {Project}.
. Optional: In the *Use GPG key for SUSE products* field, you can select the previously created content credential to automatically add a GPG public key to your SUSE products.
`zypper` automatically verifies the signatures of each software package to ensure their authenticity.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can also set the GPG public key for repositories from SUSE at a later stage.
However, changing it does not affect already synchronized products.
If you already have synchronized products in {Project}, navigate to *Content > Products* and replace the GPG key in each respective product.
====
. Optional: From the *Download Policy* list, select a download policy for your SUSE products.
For more information, see xref:Download_Policies_Overview_{context}[].
. Optional: From the *Mirroring Policy* list, select a mirroring policy for your SUSE products.
For more information, see xref:Mirroring_Policies_Overview_{context}[].
. Click *Test connection* to verify your account information.
Note that you have to re-enter your password if you have already saved your SCC account to {Project}.
. Click *Submit* to save your SCC account to {Project}.
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Content > SUSE Subscriptions*, select your SCC account, and click *Sync* to fetch a list of products associated to your SCC account.

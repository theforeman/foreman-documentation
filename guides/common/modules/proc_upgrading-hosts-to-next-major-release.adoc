.Procedure
ifndef::satellite[]
. On {Project}, enable the Leapp plugin:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-installer} --enable-foreman-plugin-leapp
----
endif::[]
. Optional: Customize the upgrade by modifying the default pre-upgrade check and upgrade job templates.
.. Clone and modify the *Run preupgrade via Leapp* template, the *Run upgrade via Leapp* template, or both.
For more information, see xref:customizing-job-templates[].
.. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Administer* > *Remote Execution Features*.
.. If you modified the pre-upgrade template, click *leapp_preupgrade*.
If you modified the upgrade template, click *leapp_upgrade*.
.. In the *Job Template* drop-down menu, select your template.
.. Click *Submit*.
The *leap_preupgrade* and *leapp_upgrade* remote execution features now point to the modified templates.
. Run a pre-upgrade check:
.. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Hosts* > *All Hosts*.
.. Select the hosts that you want to upgrade.
.. If you want to upgrade to the latest available release, from the *Schedule a Job* drop-down menu, select *Preupgrade check with Leapp*.
.. If you want to upgrade to a specific release version, click *Schedule a job*, and select *Leapp - Preupgrade* from the *Job category* list.
Follow the job wizard to start the preupgrade check.
. Review the results of the pre-upgrade check:
+
[NOTE]
====
The results of the pre-upgrade check are only available in the legacy {ProjectWebUI} job invocation details page.
====
+
.. Navigate to *Monitor* > *Jobs*.
Click the pre-upgrade check job.
.. From the *Rerun all* dropdown menu, click *Legacy UI*.
.. Click the *Leapp preupgrade report* tab to see if Leapp has found any issues on your hosts.
Issues that have the *Inhibitor* flag are considered crucial and are likely to break the upgrade procedure.
Issues that have the *Has Remediation* flag contain remediation that can help you fix the issue.
.. Click an issue that is flagged as *Has Remediation* to expand it.

* If the issue contains a remediation *Command*, you can fix it directly from {Project} using remote execution.
Select the issue.
* If the issue contains only a remediation *Hint*, use the hint to fix the issue on the host manually.

+
+
Repeat this step for other issues.
.. After you selected any issues with remediation commands, click *Fix Selected* and submit the job.
.. After the issues are fixed, click *Rerun*, and then click *Submit* to run the pre-upgrade check again to verify that the hosts you are upgrading do not have any issues and are ready to be upgraded.
. Start the upgrade:
.. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Hosts* > *All Hosts*.
.. Select the hosts that you want to upgrade.
.. If you want to upgrade to the latest available release version, select *Upgrade with Leapp* from the *Schedule a Job* drop-down menu.
.. If you want to upgrade to a specific release version, click *Schedule a job*, and select *Leapp - Upgrade* from the *Job category* list.
Follow the job wizard to start the upgrade.

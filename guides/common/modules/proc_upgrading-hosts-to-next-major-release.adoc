* Enable remote execution feature on {Project}.

.Procedure
. On {Project}, enable the Leapp plug-in:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-installer} --enable-foreman-plugin-leapp
----
. If you are using a custom job template for the Leapp pre-upgrade check, configure the *leapp_preupgrade* remote execution feature to point to your template:
.. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Administer* > *Remote Execution Features*.
.. Click *leapp_preupgrade*.
.. In the *Job Template* dropdown menu, select your template.
.. Click *Submit*.
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Hosts* > *All Hosts*.
. Select the hosts that you want to upgrade to the next major {EL} version.
. From the *Schedule Remote Job* list, select *Preupgrade check with Leapp*.
. When the check is finished, click the *Leapp preupgrade report* tab to see if Leapp has found any issues on your hosts.
Issues that have the *Inhibitor* flag are considered crucial and are likely to break the upgrade procedure.
Issues that have the *Has Remediation* flag contain remediation that can help you fix the issue.
.. Click an issue that is flagged as *Has Remediation* to expand it.

* If the issue contains a remediation *Command*, you can fix it directly from {Project} using remote execution.
Select the issue.
* If the issue contains only a remediation *Hint*, use the hint to fix the issue on the host manually.

+
+
Repeat this step for other issues.
.. After you selected any issues with remediation commands, click *Fix Selected* and submit the job.
.. After the issues are fixed, click *Rerun*, and then click *Submit* to run the pre-upgrade check again to verify that the hosts you are upgrading do not have any issues and are ready to be upgraded.
. If the pre-upgrade check verifies that the hosts do not have any issues, click *Run Upgrade* and click *Submit* to start the upgrade.
Alternatively, you can upgrade your host by selecting *Upgrade with Leapp* in the *Schedule Remote Job* drop down menu.

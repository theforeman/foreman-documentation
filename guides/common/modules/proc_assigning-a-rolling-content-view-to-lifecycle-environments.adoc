= Assigning a rolling content view to lifecycle environments

[role="_abstract"]
You can assign your rolling content view to lifecycle environments to limit Library content synchronized to {SmartProxyServers}.

To consume rolling content views, you must assign them to one or more lifecycle environments.
By doing so, you expose a subset of Library content to those lifecycle environments.
{Team} does not recommend assigning a rolling content view to the Library environment itself because it creates duplicate content within Library.
By using environments other than Library, you can synchronize your rolling content views from {ProjectServer} to any {SmartProxyServers} that are configured to consume the relevant lifecycle environments without the need to synchronize all of Library to {SmartProxyServers}.

To use the CLI instead of the {ProjectWebUI}, see the xref:cli-assigning-a-rolling-content-view-to-lifecycle-environments[].

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Content* > *Lifecycle* > *Content Views*.
. Select your rolling content view.
. Select the *Details* tab.
. In the *Lifecycle Environments* field, assign your rolling content view to your lifecycle environments.
. Click *Save Environments* to submit your changes to {Project}.

.CLI procedure
. List all content views:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
$ hammer content-view list \
--fields "content view id,name" \
--organization "_My_Organization_"
----
. Assign your rolling content view to lifecycle environments:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
$ hammer content-view update \
--id _My_Rolling_Content_View_ID_ \
--lifecycle-environment-ids _My_List_Of_Lifecycle_Environment_IDs_ \
--organization "_My_Organization_"
----
+
If you want to remove your rolling content view from all lifecycle environments, pass an empty list.

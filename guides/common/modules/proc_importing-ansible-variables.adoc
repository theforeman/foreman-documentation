= Importing Ansible Variables

Ansible roles use variables to help refine the configuration of systems that have specific requirements.
For example, you might need to identify the IP address of a system and use it as a configuration value on another system.

If you want to use Ansible variables in your Ansible playbooks, you must import the Ansible variables from {SmartProxy}.

.Procedure

To import Ansible variables, complete the following steps:

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Configure* > *Variables*.
. In the upper right of the window, select the {SmartProxy} that contains the Ansible variables that you want to import.
. Select the Ansible variables that you want to import, and click *Update*.

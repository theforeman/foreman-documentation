= Disaster recovery for active and passive {ProjectServer} with backup and restore

To prepare for disaster recovery, you can configure two {ProjectServer}s: an active primary server and a passive secondary server.
You configure periodic backups of the primary server.
If the primary server fails, you can restore a backup on the secondary server to turn it into your new primary server.

= Configuring Remote Execution for Pull Client

By default, Remote Execution uses SSH as the transport mechanism for the Script provider.
However, Remote Execution also offers pull-based transport, which you can use if your infrastructure prohibits outgoing connections from {SmartProxy} to hosts.

This is comprised of `pull-mqtt` mode on {SmartProxy} in combination with a pull client running on hosts.
Configure the `pull-mqtt` mode to migrate from Katello Agent, which is a deprecated method of pull-based transport.

NOTE: The `pull-mqtt` mode works only with the Script provider.
Ansible and other providers will continue to use their default transport settings.

The mode is configured per {SmartProxy}.
Some {SmartProxies} can be configured to use `pull-mqtt` mode while others use SSH.
If this is the case, it is possible that one remote job on a given host will use the pull client and the next job on the same host will use SSH.
If you wish to avoid this scenario, configure all {SmartProxies} to use the same mode.

.Procedure
. Enable the pull-based transport on each relevant {SmartProxyServer}:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="quotes,attributes"]
----
 # {installer-scenario-smartproxy} \
--foreman-proxy-plugin-remote-execution-script-mode pull-mqtt
----
. Configure the firewall to allow MQTT service on port 1883:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# firewall-cmd --add-port="1883/tcp"
# firewall-cmd --runtime-to-permanent
----
. In `pull-mqtt` mode, hosts subscribe for job notifications to the {SmartProxy} through which they are registered.
Therefore, it is recommended to ensure that {ProjectServer} sends remote execution jobs to that same {SmartProxy}.
To do this, in the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Administer* > *Settings*.
On the *Content* tab, set the value of *Prefer registered through {SmartProxy} for remote execution* to *Yes*.
. After you set up the pull-based transport on {SmartProxy}, you must also configure it on each host.

= Configuring pull-based transport for remote execution

By default, remote execution uses push-based SSH as the transport mechanism for the Script provider.
If your infrastructure prohibits outgoing connections from {SmartProxy} to hosts, you can use remote execution with pull-based transport instead.
The use of pull-based transport is not limited to those infrastructures.

The pull-based transport comprises `pull-mqtt` mode on {SmartProxy} in combination with a pull client running on hosts.

[NOTE]
====
The `pull-mqtt` mode works only with the Script provider.
Ansible and other providers will continue to use their default transport settings.
====

The mode is configured per {SmartProxy}.
Some {SmartProxies} can be configured to use `pull-mqtt` mode while others use SSH.
If this is the case, it is possible that one remote job on a given host will use the pull client and the next job on the same host will use SSH.
If you wish to avoid this scenario, configure all {SmartProxies} to use the same mode.

.Procedure
. Enable the pull-based transport on each relevant {SmartProxyServer}:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="quotes,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-installer} --foreman-proxy-plugin-remote-execution-script-mode pull-mqtt
----
. Configure the firewall to allow the MQTT service:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# firewall-cmd --add-service=mqtt
----
include::snip_make-firewall-settings-persistent.adoc[]
. In `pull-mqtt` mode, hosts subscribe for job notifications to either your {ProjectServer} or any {SmartProxyServer} through which they are registered.
Ensure that {ProjectServer} sends remote execution jobs to that same {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer}:
.. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Administer* > *Settings*.
.. On the *Content* tab, set the value of *Prefer registered through {SmartProxy} for remote execution* to *Yes*.

.Next steps
* Configure your hosts for the pull-based transport.

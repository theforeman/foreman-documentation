= Host requirements for custom {RHEL} images

[role="_abstract"]
Before you create an image, you need to manually install and configure a {RHEL} image on a dedicated host.

.Prerequisites
* Use a Linux host machine to create an image.
This example uses {RHEL}{nbsp}7 Workstation.
* Use `virt-manager` on your workstation to complete this procedure.
If you create the image on a remote server, connect to the server from your workstation with `virt-manager`.
* A {RHEL} 7 ISO file (see https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/69/ver=/rhel---7/7.4/x86_64/product-software[{RHEL} 7.4 Binary DVD]).

For more information about installing your {RHEL} Workstation, see the {RHELDocsBaseURL}7/html-single/installation_guide/index[_{RHEL}{nbsp}7 Installation Guide_].

Before you can create custom images, install the following packages:

* Install `libvirt`, `qemu-kvm`, and graphical tools:

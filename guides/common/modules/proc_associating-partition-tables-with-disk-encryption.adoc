= Associating partition tables with disk encryption

{Project} contains partition tables that encrypt the disk of your host by using Linux Unified Key Setup (LUKS) during host provisioning.
Encrypted disks on hosts protect data at rest.
Optionally, you can also bind the disk to a Tang server through Clevis for decryption during boot.

Associate the partition table with your operating system entry.
Then, you assign the partition table to your host group or select it manually during provisioning.

.Prerequisites
* Your host has access to the `{client-clevis-repository}` repository to install `clevis` during provisioning.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Hosts* > *Provisioning Setup* > *Operating Systems*.
. Select your {client-os} entry.
. On the *Partition Table* tab, associate `{client-provisioning-template-type} default encrypted` with your operating system entry.
. Create a host group that uses the `{client-provisioning-template-type} default encrypted` partition table.
For more information, see {ManagingHostsDocURL}Creating_a_Host_Group_managing-hosts[Creating a host group] in _{ManagingHostsDocTitle}_.
. Decrypt the disk of your host during boot time by using one of the following options:
+
* LUKS encryption: Add the host parameter `disk_enc_passphrase` as type *string* and your cleartext passphrase of the LUKS container as the value.
* Clevis and Tang: Add the host parameter `disk_enc_tang_servers` as type *array* and your list of Tang servers (example: `["1.2.3.4"]` or `["{server-example-com}", "5.6.7.8"]`).
+
If you set `disk_enc_tang_servers`, do not set `disk_enc_passphrase` because the passphrase slot is removed from the LUKS container after provisioning.

= Grub2 UEFI boot loader and the `bootloader-universe` structure

[role="_abstract"]
*PXEGrub2* GRUB-based PXE boot loader supports BIOS and UEFI environments, as well as Secure Boot environments.
The `bootloader-universe` directory structure organizes Grub2 binaries by OS and architecture.

PXEGrub2 is managed by the {SmartProxy}’s TFTP service, which provides PXE clients with the appropriate boot loader binaries and configuration files.

By using the `bootloader-universe` directory structure, Grub2-based UEFI boot loaders can be organized and managed by distribution, version, and architecture.
This feature does not require explicit configuration.
It is automatically enabled when the {SmartProxy} uses the
`/var/lib/tftpboot/bootloader-universe/pxegrub2/` directory structure.

The *`bootloader-universe`* directory enables multiple operating system versions and architectures to coexist without conflicts.

When the {SmartProxy} recognizes the `/var/lib/tftpboot/bootloader-universe/pxegrub2/` structure,
boot loaders are stored in an organized hierarchy by OS, version, and architecture.

Before placing boot loader binaries (`shim__My_Arch__.efi`, `grub__My_Arch__.efi`), you must manually create the corresponding directory hierarchy by using the `mkdir` command, for example, `# mkdir -p /var/lib/tftpboot/bootloader-universe/pxegrub2/__My_Distribution__/__My_Version__/__My_Arch__`.

| `/var/lib/tftpboot/bootloader-universe/pxegrub2/__My_Distribution__/__My_Version__/__My_Arch__/`
| Stores OS- and architecture-specific Grub2 binaries (shim__My_Arch__.efi, grub__My_Arch__.efi) and symbolic links (boot.efi, boot-sb.efi).
Used for version-specific boot loader management within the `bootloader-universe` hierarchy.
| **Create manually**

| `/var/lib/tftpboot/bootloader-universe/pxegrub2/__My_Distribution__/default/__My_Arch__/`
| Stores OS- and architecture-specific Grub2 binaries (`shim__My_Arch__.efi`, `grub__My_Arch__.efi`) and symbolic links (`boot.efi`, `boot-sb.efi`).
Used as a fallback directory when a specific version is not available.
| **Create manually**

| `/var/lib/tftpboot/host-config/__My_MAC_Address__/grub2/`
| Host-specific directory automatically created when a host enters *Build mode*.
Contains symbolic links (`boot.efi`, `boot-sb.efi`) and a generated `grub.cfg`.

----
In this structure, the following principles apply:
* `boot.efi` and `boot-sb.efi` are symbolic links to `grub__My_Arch__.efi` and `shim__My_Arch__.efi`, respectively.
The {SmartProxy} automatically creates host-specific links to these files under `host-config/__My_MAC_Address__/grub2/`.
* In the {ProjectWebUI}, the `__My_Distribution__` OS and distribution identifiers  must not contain spaces.
* You must manually create `boot.efi` and `boot-sb.efi` symbolic links within each `__My_Arch__` directory, for example:

----
$ ln -s grubx64.efi boot.efi
$ ln -s shimx64.efi boot-sb.efi
$ chmod 644 grubx64.efi shimx64.efi
----
The `chmod` command ensures that TFTP and HTTPBoot clients can read these files.

In addition to the `bootloader-universe` layout, {Project} also supports the *Legacy layout* for backward compatibility.

If the `/var/lib/tftpboot/bootloader-universe/pxegrub2/` structure is not used, {Project} falls back to the legacy `/var/lib/tftpboot/grub2/` directory.
Boot loaders are stored in a flat layout, but when a host enters *Build mode*, the {SmartProxy} creates a host-specific directory with the required configuration files and links.

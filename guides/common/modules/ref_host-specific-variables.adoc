[id="Host_Specific_Variables_{context}"]
= Host-Specific Variables

The following variables enable using host data within templates.
Note that job templates accept only `@host` variables.

.Host Specific Variables and Macros
[options="header"]
|====
|Name |Description
|@host.architecture |The architecture of the host.
|@host.bond_interfaces |Returns an array of all bonded interfaces.
See xref:Parsing_Arrays_{context}[].
|@host.capabilities |The method of system provisioning, can be either build (for example kickstart) or image.
|@host.certname |The SSL certificate name of the host.
|@host.diskLayout |The disk layout of the host.
Can be inherited from the operating system.
|@host.domain |The domain of the host.
|@host.environment |The Puppet environment of the host.
|@host.facts |Returns a Ruby hash of facts from Facter.
For example to access the 'ipaddress' fact from the output, specify @host.facts['ipaddress'].
|@host.grub_pass |Returns the host's bootloader password.
|@host.hostgroup |The host group of the host.
|host_enc['parameters'] |Returns a Ruby hash containing information on host parameters.
For example, use host_enc['parameters']['lifecycle_environment'] to get the life cycle environment of a host.
|@host.image_build? |Returns `true` if the host is provisioned using an image.
|@host.interfaces |Contains an array of all available host interfaces including the primary interface.
See xref:Parsing_Arrays_{context}[].
|@host.interfaces_with_identifier('IDs') |Returns array of interfaces with given identifier.
You can pass an array of multiple identifiers as an input, for example @host.interfaces_with_identifier(['eth0', 'eth1']).
See xref:Parsing_Arrays_{context}[].
|@host.ip |The IP address of the host.
|@host.location |The location of the host.
|@host.mac |The MAC address of the host.
|@host.managed_interfaces |Returns an array of managed interfaces (excluding BMC and bonded interfaces).
See xref:Parsing_Arrays_{context}[].
|@host.medium |The assigned operating system installation medium.
|@host.name |The full name of the host.
|@host.operatingsystem.family |The operating system family.
|@host.operatingsystem.major |The major version number of the assigned operating system.
|@host.operatingsystem.minor |The minor version number of the assigned operating system.
|@host.operatingsystem.name |The assigned operating system name.
|@host.operatingsystem.boot_files_uri(medium_provider) |Full path to the kernel and initrd, returns an array.
|@host.os.medium_uri(@host) |The URI used for provisioning (path configured in installation media).
|host_param('parameter_name') |Returns the value of the specified host parameter.
|host_param_false?('parameter_name') |Returns `false` if the specified host parameter evaluates to false.
|host_param_true?('parameter_name') |Returns `true` if the specified host parameter evaluates to true.
|@host.primary_interface |Returns the primary interface of the host.
|@host.provider |The compute resource provider.
|@host.provision_interface |Returns the provisioning interface of the host.
Returns an interface object.
|@host.ptable |The partition table name.
|@host.puppet_ca_server |The Puppet CA server the host must use.
|@host.puppetmaster |The Puppet server the host must use.
|@host.pxe_build? |Returns `true` if the host is provisioned using the network or PXE.
|@host.shortname |The short name of the host.
|@host.sp_ip |The IP address of the BMC interface.
|@host.sp_mac |The MAC address of the BMC interface.
|@host.sp_name |The name of the BMC interface.
|@host.sp_subnet |The subnet of the BMC network.
|@host.subnet.dhcp |Returns `true` if a DHCP proxy is configured for this host.
|@host.subnet.dns_primary |The primary DNS server of the host.
|@host.subnet.dns_secondary |The secondary DNS server of the host.
|@host.subnet.gateway |The gateway of the host.
|@host.subnet.mask |The subnet mask of the host.
|@host.url_for_boot(:initrd) |Full path to the initrd image associated with this host.
Not recommended, as it does not interpolate variables.
|@host.url_for_boot(:kernel) |Full path to the kernel associated with this host.
Not recommended, as it does not interpolate variables, prefer boot_files_uri.
|@provisioning_type |Equals to 'host' or 'hostgroup' depending on type of provisioning.
|@static |Returns `true` if the network configuration is static.
|@template_name |Name of the template being rendered.
|grub_pass |Returns a bootloader argument to set the encrypted bootloader password, such as *--md5pass=#{@host.grub_pass}*.
|ks_console |Returns a string assembled using the port and the baud rate of the host which can be added to a kernel line.
For example *console=ttyS1,9600*.
|root_pass |Returns the root password configured for the system.
|====

The majority of common Ruby methods can be applied on host-specific variables.
For example, to extract the last segment of the host's IP address, you can use:

----
<% @host.ip.split('.').last %>

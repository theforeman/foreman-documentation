= Creating Ansible Variables

Ansible roles use variables to help refine the configuration of systems that have specific requirements.

Usually, you can import Ansible variables for the Ansible roles that you are using. If you require further refinement of your system configuration, you can also create Ansible variables in {Project}.

.Procedure

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Configure* > *Variables*.
. In the upper right of the window, click *New Ansible Variable*.
. In the *Key* field, enter a name for the variable. Ensure that the name references the Ansible role name.
. In the *Description* field, add a description for the variable.
. From the *Ansible role* list, select the Ansible role to associate with the variable.
. Optional: To override the Ansible variable with {Project}, see the xref:overriding-Ansible-variables_{context}[].
. To save the Ansible variable, click *Submit*.

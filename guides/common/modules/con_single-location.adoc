An _integrated {SmartProxy}_ is a virtual {SmartProxyServer} that is created by default in {ProjectServer} during the installation process.
This means {ProjectServer} can be used to provision directly connected hosts for {Project} deployment in a single geographical location, therefore only one physical server is needed.
The base systems of isolated {SmartProxies} can be directly managed by {ProjectServer}, however it is not recommended to use this layout to manage other hosts in remote locations.

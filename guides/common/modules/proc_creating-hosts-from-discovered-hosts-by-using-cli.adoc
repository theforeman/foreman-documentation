= Creating hosts from discovered hosts by using Hammer CLI

[role="_abstract"]
Provisioning discovered hosts follows a provisioning process that is similar to PXE provisioning.
The main difference is that instead of manually entering the host's MAC address, you can select the host to provision from the list of discovered hosts.

.Prerequisites
include::snip_prerequisite-networking-for-provisioning.adoc[]
* You have one or more discovered hosts in your {Project} inventory.
include::snip_prerequisites-common-compute-resource.adoc[]
* You have associated a `Discovery kexec`-kind template and `provisioning`-kind template with the operating system.

.Procedure
. Identify the discovered host to provision:
+
----
$ hammer discovery list
----
. Select the host and provision it by using a host group.
Set a new host name with the `--new-name` option:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
$ hammer discovery provision \
--build true \
--enabled true \
--hostgroup "_My_Host_Group_" \
--location "_My_Location_" \
--managed true \
--name "_My_Host_Name_" \
--new-name "_My_New_Host_Name_" \
--organization "_My_Organization_"
----
+
This removes the host from the discovered host listing and creates a host entry with the provisioning settings.
The Discovery image automatically reboots the host to PXE or initiates kernel execution.
The host detects the DHCP service and starts installing the operating system.
The rest of the process is identical to the normal PXE workflow.

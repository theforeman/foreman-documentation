= Preparing for disaster recovery with active and passive {ProjectServer} and backup and restore

Create your passive {ProjectServer} as a clone of your active {ProjectServer}.
Configure periodic backups on the active server, and restore them on your passive server.

.Procedure
. Clone your active {ProjectServer}.
For more information, see xref:cloning_satellite_server[].
. Keep the source server powered on. Power off the new cloned server.
+
The source server remains your active primary server, while the clone server becomes the passive secondary server.
. Define a schedule for periodic offline backups of your active {ProjectServer}.
Consider your tolerance for potential data loss and your storage options: Taking backups frequently will result in smaller amounts of data loss in case of a disaster, but backups require a significant amount of storage space.
For information about the size of {Project} backups, see xref:Estimating_the_Size_of_a_Backup_admin[].
+
You can combine full backups with incremental backups.
For an example of a `cron` job that ensures regular backups, see xref:Example_of_a_Weekly_Full_Backup_Followed_by_Daily_Incremental_Backups_{context}[].
. Schedule periodic offline backups of your active {ProjectServer}.
. Define your backup retention policy.
Consider how many backups you want to store: Regularly removing outdated backups helps optimize storage usage.
For information about performing the backup, including prerequisites and other important information, see xref:cloning_satellite_server[].
. {Project} stores the backups in the `_/var/{project-context}-backup_` directory by default.
Ensure that these backup directories are encrypted and regularly synchronized to a secure location.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
ifndef::foreman-el,foreman-deb[]
{ProjectServer} backups contain sensitive information from the `/root/ssl-build` directory.
For example, they can contain hostnames, ssh keys, request files, and SSL certificates.
endif::[]
Encrypting or moving the backups to a secure location helps minimize the risk of damage or unauthorized access to the hosts.
====

.Verification
. Verify that {Project} takes backups according to the schedule you defined.
. Perform further testing steps in an isolated staging environment:
.. Mimic a full outage on the active server.
To make sure the active server is inaccessible, you can turn the machine off, halt the virtual machine (VM) if your server runs on a VM, or isolate the machine by using a firewall.
.. Switch DNS records of the active server with the DNS records of the passive server.
.. Assess the functionality of the test {ProjectServer}.
See xref:Retrieving_the_Status_of_Services_{context}[].
.. Perform these verification checks regularly.

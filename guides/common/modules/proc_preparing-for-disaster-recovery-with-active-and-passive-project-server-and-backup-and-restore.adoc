= Preparing for disaster recovery with active and passive {ProjectServer} and backup and restore

[role="_abstract"]
Create your passive {ProjectServer} by restoring a backup of your active {ProjectServer}.
Configure periodic backups of the active server.

.Prerequisites
* Review xref:overview-of-recommended-disaster-recovery-plans[] to ensure that this disaster recovery plan works for you.
* You have a {ProjectServer} installed.

.Procedure
. Define a schedule for periodic offline backups of your active {ProjectServer}.
Consider your tolerance for potential data loss and your storage options: Taking backups frequently will result in smaller amounts of data loss in case of a disaster, but backups require a significant amount of storage space.

For information about the size of {Project} backups, see xref:Estimating_the_Size_of_a_Backup_admin[].

+
You can combine full backups with incremental backups.
For an example of a `cron` job that ensures regular backups, see xref:Example_of_a_Weekly_Full_Backup_Followed_by_Daily_Incremental_Backups_{context}[].
. Schedule periodic offline backups of your active {ProjectServer} to be taken according to the schedule you defined.
For information about performing backups, see xref:backing-up-{project-context}-server-and-{smart-proxy-context}_admin[].
. Ensure that the backup directories are encrypted and regularly synchronized to a secure location.
By default, {Project} stores the backups in the `_/var/{project-context}-backup_` directory.

[IMPORTANT]
====
ifndef::foreman-el,foreman-deb[]
{ProjectServer} backups contain sensitive information from the `/root/ssl-build` directory.
For example, they can contain hostnames, ssh keys, request files, and SSL certificates.
endif::[]
Encrypting or moving the backups to a secure location helps minimize the risk of damage or unauthorized access to the hosts.
====
. Restore the most recent backup on a system that will serve as your passive {ProjectServer}.
For information about restoring backups, see xref:restoring-{project-context}-server-or-{smart-proxy-context}-from-a-backup_admin[].
. Optional: Automate backup restoration to keep the passive server periodically updated with the latest backup.
A regularly restored passive server helps reduce switchover time if the active server fails.
+
Consider how often you want the backups to be restored: More frequent updates reduce potential data loss but increase infrastructure and automation costs.
. Power off the passive server.
Keep the active server powered on.
. Define your backup retention policy.
Consider how many backups you want to store: Regularly removing outdated backups helps optimize storage usage.

.Verification
. Verify that {Project} takes backups according to the schedule you defined.
. Perform further testing steps in an isolated staging environment:
.. Mimic a full outage on the active server.
To make sure the active server is inaccessible, you can turn the machine off, halt the virtual machine (VM) if your server runs on a VM, or isolate the machine by using a firewall.
.. Switch DNS records of the active server with the DNS records of the passive server.
.. Assess the functionality of the test {ProjectServer}.
For more information, see xref:retrieving-the-status-of-services-by-using-cli_{context}[].
.. Perform these verification checks regularly.

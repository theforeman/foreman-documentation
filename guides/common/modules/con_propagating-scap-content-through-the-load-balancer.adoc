= Propagating SCAP content through the load balancer

If you use OpenSCAP to manage security compliance on your clients, you must configure the SCAP client to send ARF reports to the load balancer instead of {SmartProxy}.
The configuration procedure depends on the method you have selected to deploy compliance policies.

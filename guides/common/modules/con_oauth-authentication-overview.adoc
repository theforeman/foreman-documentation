= OAuth authentication overview

As an alternative to basic authentication, you can use limited OAuth 1.0a authentication.
This is sometimes referred to as _1-legged OAuth_.

To view OAuth settings, in the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Administer* > *Settings* > *Authentication*.
The *OAuth consumer key* is the token to be used by all OAuth clients.

{Project} stores OAuth settings in the `/etc/foreman/settings.yaml` file.
Use the `{foreman-installer}` script to configure these settings.

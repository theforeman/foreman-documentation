= Integrating a local self-managed DNS service

The installer exposes a limited feature set for the {Project} installer-managed DNS service.
For example, you can configure only a single forward DNS zone.
As an alternative, you can first use the installer-managed DNS and later convert it to a self-managed DNS server to bypass the limitations.

.Prerequisites
* You installed and configured a DNS service on the {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer} host.
* The DNS service supports link:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2136[RFC 2136]-compatible updates

.Procedure
. Set the local, self-managed DNS service on your {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer}:

. For each affected {SmartProxy}, update the configuration of that {SmartProxy} in the {ProjectWebUI}.

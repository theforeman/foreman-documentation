= Disabling TFTP for integration

// MARC: New module. Content is based on https://github.com/theforeman/foreman-documentation/blob/master/guides/common/modules/proc_disabling-dns-dhcp-tftp-for-unmanaged-networks.adoc, and adjusted for TFTP.
// Needs to be checked if it is technically correct.

If you want to manually manage a TFTP service, you must prevent {Project} from maintaining this service on the operating system and disable orchestration to avoid errors.

[NOTE]
====
Disabling TFTP in {Project} does not remove the related backend service on the operating system.

.Procedure

. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Infrastructure* > *Subnets*.

. For each subnet that is associated with the TFTP {SmartProxy}:

.. Select the subnet.

.. On the *{SmartProxies}* tab, clear the *TFTP {SmartProxy}* field.

. On {ProjectServer}, enter:

[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-installer} --foreman-proxy-tftp false
----


[NOTE]
====
{Project} does not perform orchestration when a {SmartProxy} is not set for a given subnet and domain.
When enabling or disabling {SmartProxy} associations, orchestration commands for existing hosts can fail if the expected records and configuration files are not present.
When associating a {SmartProxy} to turn orchestration on, ensure the required DHCP, DNS records, and TFTP files are in place for the existing {Project} hosts in order to prevent host deletion failures in the future.

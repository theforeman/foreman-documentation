= Adding Installation Media to {Project}

Installation media are sources of packages that {ProjectServer} uses to install a base operating system on a machine from an external repository.
ifdef::foreman-el,katello[]
When you install the Katello plug-in, you can download packages from a Pulp mirror.
In this case, installation media are ignored.
endif::[]
ifdef::satellite[]
You can use this parameter to install third-party content.
Red Hat content is delivered through repository syncing instead.
endif::[]

You can view installation media by navigating to *Hosts* > *Provisioning Setup* > *Installation Media*.

Installation media must be in the format of an operating system installation tree and must be accessible from the machine hosting the installer through an HTTP URL.

[NOTE]
====
Other protocols, such as HTTPS or NFS, are known to work but have not been tested.
{Team} recommends using HTTP.

You can hypothetically use NFS share for PXE-based provisioning in a semi-automated way by copying the `initrd.img` and `vmlinuz` files from the NFS source to `/var/lib/tftpboot/boot` on {SmartProxy} with the expected names.
Only then PXE booting can proceed further.

ifndef::orcharhino[]
By default, {Project} includes installation media for some official Linux distributions.
Note that some of those installation media are targeted for a specific version of an operating system.
For example *CentOS mirror (7.x)* must be used for CentOS 7 or earlier, and *CentOS mirror (8.x)* must be used for CentOS 8 or later.
endif::[]

If you want to improve download performance when using installation media to install operating systems on multiple hosts, you must modify the *Path* of the installation medium to point to the closest mirror or a local copy.

To use the CLI instead of the {ProjectWebUI}, see the xref:cli-adding-installation-media_{context}[].

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Hosts* > *Provisioning Setup* > *Installation Media*.
. Click *Create Medium*.
. In the *Name* field, enter a name to represent the installation media entry.
. In the *Path* enter the URL that contains the installation tree.
ifdef::client-content-dnf[]
You can use following variables in the path to represent multiple different system architectures and versions:
  * `$arch` {endash} The system architecture.
  * `$version` {endash} The operating system version.
  * `$major` {endash} The operating system major version.
  * `$minor` {endash} The operating system minor version.

Example HTTP path:

[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
http://download.example.com/{client-installation-medium}/$version/Server/$arch/os/
----
ifndef::orcharhino,satellite[]
+
Example NFS path:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
nfs://download.example.com:/{client-installation-medium}/$version/Server/$arch/os/
----

endif::[]
endif::[]
ifndef::orcharhino,satellite[]
Synchronized content on {SmartProxyServers} always uses an HTTP path.
{SmartProxyServer} managed content does not support NFS paths.
endif::[]
. From the *Operating system family* list, select the distribution or family of the installation medium.
ifndef::orcharhino[]
For example, CentOS and Fedora are in the `Red Hat` family.
endif::[]
ifndef::orcharhino,satellite[]
Debian and Ubuntu belong to the `Debian` family.
endif::[]
ifdef::orcharhino[]
{client-os} belongs to the `{client-os-family}` family.
endif::[]
. Click the *Organizations* and *Locations* tabs, to change the provisioning context.
{ProjectServer} adds the installation medium to the set provisioning context.
. Click *Submit* to save your installation medium.

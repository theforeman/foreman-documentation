= Structured APT content

With structured APT content, Deb repositories on {Project} use the same structure as the upstream Deb repository.
This allows features that attach to the repository structure to work the same way as they would with the upstream repository, for example:

* `apt list --upgradable` will no longer list `unknown,unknown` as the release and distribution for packages.
Instead, `apt` will list the proper release and distribution from the upstream repository.
* You can use client-side APT pinning in the same way as when using the upstream repository directly.

.Comprehensibility
With structured APT content, repositories in {Project} use the same structure as the upstream repository.
They do not use the special `default/all` publication concept which does not exist outside of {Project}.

.Performance
With structured APT content, publishing repository metadata will take roughly half the time, compared to publishing without structured APT content.

.Limitations
* Once you have enabled structured APT on {Project}, do not disable it.
Using structured APT content will be mandatory with a future {Project} version.
* Any Deb packages that were uploaded to
ifdef::katello[]
{Project} 3.2
endif::[]
ifdef::orcharhino[]
{Project} 6.4
endif::[]
and older are not automatically migrated to structured APT content.
You can work around this issue by deleting and re-uploading affected Deb packages.

.Prerequisites for hosts
* The host is registered to {ProjectName}.
include::snip_prerequisite-project-client-repository-enabled.adoc[]
ifdef::orcharhino[]
* Your {DL} host uses the latest {project-client-name}.

* Your {DL} host runs `subscription-manager` version 1.29.35-3 or higher.

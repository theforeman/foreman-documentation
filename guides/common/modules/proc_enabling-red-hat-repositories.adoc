If outside network access requires usage of an HTTP proxy, configure a default HTTP proxy for your server.
For more information, see {InstallingServerDocURL}adding-a-default-http-proxy_{build}[Adding a Default HTTP Proxy to {Project}].

To select the repositories to synchronize, you must first identify the Product that contains the repository, and then enable that repository based on the relevant release version and base architecture.

.For {RHEL} 8 Hosts

To provision {RHEL} 8 hosts, you require the *{RHEL} 8 for x86_64 - AppStream (RPMs)* and *{RHEL} 8 for x86_64 - BaseOS (RPMs)* repositories.

.For {RHEL} 7 Hosts

To provision {RHEL} 7 hosts, you require the *{RHEL} 7 Server (RPMs)* repository.

The difference between associating {RHEL} operating system release version with either *7Server* repositories or *7._X_* repositories is that *7Server* repositories contain all the latest updates while *{RHEL} 7._X_* repositories stop getting updates after the next minor version release.
Note that Kickstart repositories only have minor versions.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Content* > *Red{nbsp}Hat Repositories*.
. To find repositories, either enter the repository name, or toggle the *Recommended Repositories* button to the on position to view a list of repositories that you require.
. In the Available Repositories pane, click a repository to expand the repository set.
. Click the *Enable* icon next to the base architecture and release version that you want.

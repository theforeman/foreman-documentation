If outside network access requires usage of an HTTP Proxy, configure a default HTTP Proxy for your server.
See {InstallingProjectDocURL}adding-a-default-http-proxy_{build}[Adding a default HTTP Proxy]

To select the repositories to synchronize, you must first identify the product that contains the repository, and then enable that repository based on the relevant release version and base architecture.
For {RHEL} 8, you must enable both AppStream and BaseOS repositories.

.Repository Versioning
The difference between associating {RHEL} operating system with either 7 Server repositories or 7._X_ repositories is that 7 Server repositories contain all the latest updates while {RHEL} 7._X_ repositories stop getting updates after the next minor version release.
Note that Kickstart repositories only have minor versions.

.For {RHEL} 8 Clients

To provision {RHEL} 8 clients, you require the *{RHEL} 8 for x86_64 - AppStream (RPMS)* and *{RHEL} 8 for x86_64 - BaseOS (RPMs)* repositories.

.For {RHEL} 7 Clients

To provision {RHEL} 7 clients, you require the *{RHEL} 7 Server (RPMs)* repository.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Content* > *Red{nbsp}Hat Repositories*.
. To find repositories, either enter the repository name, or toggle the *Recommended Repositories* button to the on position to view a list of repositories that you require.

+

+

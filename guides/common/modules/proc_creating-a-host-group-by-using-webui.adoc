[NOTE]
====
Puppet fails to retrieve the Puppet CA certificate while registering a host with a host group associated with a Puppet environment created inside a `Production` environment.

To create a suitable Puppet environment to be associated with a host group, manually create a directory:

[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# mkdir /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/_example_environment_
----
====
. Click *Submit* to save the host group.

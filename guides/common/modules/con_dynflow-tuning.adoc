= Dynflow Tuning

Dynflow is the workflow management system and task orchestrator which is a {Project} plugin and is used to execute the different tasks of {Project} in an out-of-order execution manner.
Under the conditions when there are a lot of clients checking in on {Project} and running a number of tasks, Dynflow can take some help from an added tuning specifying how many executors can it launch.

For more information about the tunings involved related to Dynflow, see `\https://{foreman-example-com}/foreman_tasks/sidekiq`.

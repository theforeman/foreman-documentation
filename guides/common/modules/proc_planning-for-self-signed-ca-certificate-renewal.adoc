= Planning for self-signed CA certificate renewal

If you need to update the Certification Authority (CA) certificate on your {ProjectServer}, add the new CA certificate and use a temporary dual CA certificate file to retain the HTTPS connections to your {ProjectServer} during the renewal.

.Procedure
. Add the new SSL certificate to the CA certificate file on {ProjectServer} and keep the old SSL certificate.
. Renew the certificates on {ProjectServer} and any {SmartProxyServers}.
. Deploy the dual CA certificate on hosts.
. Remove the old certificate from the CA certificates file on {ProjectServer}, so the CA certificate file contains only the new SSL certificate.
. Renew the certificates on {ProjectServer} and any {SmartProxyServers}.
. Deploy the new CA certificate on hosts.

= Changing the Provisioning Password Hashing Algorithm

To provision FIPS-compliant hosts, you must first set the password hashing algorithm that you use in provisioning to SHA256.
This configuration setting must be applied for each operating system you want to deploy as FIPS-compliant.

.Procedure
. Identify the Operating System IDs:

. Update each operating system's password hash value.
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer os update \
--password-hash SHA256
--title "_My_Operating_System_"

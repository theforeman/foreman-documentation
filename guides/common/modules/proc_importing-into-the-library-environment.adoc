= Importing into the Library Environment

You can use the archive that the `hammer content-export` command outputs to import into the Library lifecycle environment of another organization
For more information about exporting contents from the Library environment, see xref:Exporting_the_Library_Environment_{context}[].

.Prerequisites

To import in to an Organization's library lifecycle environment ensure that {ProjectServer} where you want to import meets the following conditions:

. The exported archive must be in a directory under `/var/lib/pulp/imports`.
. The directory must have `pulp:pulp` permissions so that Pulp can read and write the `.json` files in that directory.
. If there are any Red Hat repositories in the export archive, the importing organization's manifest must contain subscriptions for the products contained
within the export.
. The user importing the content must have the 'Content Importer' Role.

.Procedure
. Copy the archived file with the exported Content View version to the `/var/lib/pulp/imports` directory on {ProjectServer} where you want to import.
. Set the permission of the archive files to `pulp:pulp`.

. On {ProjectServer} where you want to import, create/enable repositories the same name and label as the exported content.
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Content* > *Products*, click the *Yum content* tab and add the same `Yum` content that the exported Content View version includes.
. Identify the Organization that you wish to import into.
. To import the Library content to {ProjectServer}, enter the following command:

# hammer content-import library \
--organization="_Organization_Name_" \
--path=/var/lib/pulp/imports/2021-03-02T03-35-24-00-00

Note you must enter the full path `/var/lib/pulp/imports/<path>`. Relative paths do not work.
. To verify that you imported the Library content, check the contents of the Product and Repositories.
A new Content View called `Import-Library` is created in the target organization.
This Content View is used to facilitate the library content import.

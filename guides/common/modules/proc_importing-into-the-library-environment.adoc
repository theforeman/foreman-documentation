= Importing into the Library Environment

You can import exported Library content into the Library lifecycle environment of an organization on another {ProjectServer}.
For more information about exporting contents from the Library environment, see xref:Exporting_the_Library_Environment_{context}[].

.Prerequisites
* The exported files must be in a directory under `/var/lib/pulp/imports`.
* If there are any Red Hat repositories in the exported content, the importing organization's manifest must contain subscriptions for the products contained within the export.
* The user importing the content must have the _Content Importer_ Role.

.Procedure
. Copy the exported files to a subdirectory of `/var/lib/pulp/imports` on {ProjectServer} where you want to import.
. Set the ownership of the import directory and its contents to `pulp:pulp`.

. Identify the Organization that you wish to import into.
. To import the Library content to {ProjectServer}, enter the following command:

# hammer content-import library \
--organization="_My_Organization_" \
--path=/var/lib/pulp/imports/2021-03-02T03-35-24-00-00
----
+
Note you must enter the full path `/var/lib/pulp/imports/_My_Exported_Library_Dir_`.
Relative paths do not work.
. To verify that you imported the Library content, check the contents of the Product and Repositories.
A new Content View called `Import-Library` is created in the target organization.
This Content View is used to facilitate the Library content import.
+
By default, this Content View is not shown in the {ProjectWebUI}.
`Import-Library` is not meant to be assigned directly to hosts.
Instead, assign your hosts to `Default Organization View` or another Content View as you would normally.

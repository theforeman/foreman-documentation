Enablement of the module `{dnf-module}` warns about a conflict with `postgresql:10` and `ruby:2.5` as these modules are set to the default module versions on {EL} 8.
The module `{dnf-module}` has a dependency for the modules `postgresql:12` and `ruby:2.7` that will be enabled with the `{dnf-module}` module.
These warnings do not cause installation process failure, hence can be ignored safely.

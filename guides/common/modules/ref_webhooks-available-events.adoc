[id="webhooks-available-events_{context}"]
= Available Webhook Events

The following table contains a list of webhook events that are available from the {ProjectWebUI}.
`Action` events trigger webhooks only on `success`, so if an action fails, a webhook is not triggered.

For more information about payload, go to *Administer* > *About* > *Support* > *Templates DSL*.
A list of available types is provided in the following table.
Some events are marked as *custom*, in that case, the payload is an object object but a Ruby hash (key-value data structure) so syntax is different.

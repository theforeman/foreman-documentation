= Integrating the libvirt API to manage DNS records

If you manage VMs through the `libvirt` API, you can integrate the API into {ProjectServer} to manage DNS records.
The integration enables you to continue using `dnsmasq` in `libvirt`, and {Project} manages DNS records for hosts during their life cycle.

.Procedure
. Configure {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer} to connect to the `libvirt` API:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-installer} \
--foreman-proxy-dns true \
--foreman-proxy-dns-provider libvirt \
--foreman-proxy-libvirt-network default \
--foreman-proxy-libvirt-url qemu:///system
----
+
Note that you can only use one network and URL for both the `dns_libvirt` and `dhcp_libvirt` providers.
. For each affected {SmartProxy}, update the configuration of that {SmartProxy} in the {ProjectWebUI}.

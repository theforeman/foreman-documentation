.Procedure
. Create a backup of your {SmartProxyServer}.
* If your {SmartProxyServer} runs on a virtual machine:
.. Stop all {Project} services:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} service stop
----
.. Take a snapshot.
.. Start all {Project} services:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----

ifdef::foreman-el[]
# {project-package-update} https://yum.theforeman.org/releases/{ProjectVersion}/el9/x86_64/foreman-release.rpm

----
. Stop {Project} services:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} service stop
----
. Update the required packages:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="attributes"]
----
# {project-package-update}
----
. Run the {Project} installer:

endif::[]
ifdef::satellite[]
. Delete cached repository metadata:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="attributes"]
----
# yum clean metadata
----
. Upgrade the `{foreman-maintain}` utility on the {SmartProxyServer} to its latest version:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} self-upgrade
----
. Verify that the `/etc/foreman-proxy/settings.yml` file on the {SmartProxyServer} points to the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of your {ProjectServer}:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="attributes"]
----
# grep foreman_url /etc/foreman-proxy/settings.yml
----
. Determine whether {SmartProxyServer} is ready for the upgrade:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} upgrade check
----
+
Review the results and address any highlighted error conditions before performing the upgrade.
. Run the {Project} upgrade command.
Because of the lengthy upgrade time, consider using a utility such as `tmux`.

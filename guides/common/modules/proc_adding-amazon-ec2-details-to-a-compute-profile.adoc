= Adding Amazon EC2 Details to a Compute Profile

You can add hardware settings for instances on Amazon EC2 to a compute profile.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Infrastructure*{nbsp}>{nbsp}*Compute Profiles* and click the name of your profile, then click an EC2 connection.
. From the *Flavor* list, select the hardware profile on EC2 to use for the host.
. From the *Image* list, select the image to use for image-based provisioning.
. From the *Availability zone* list, select the target cluster to use within the chosen EC2 region.
. From the *Subnet* list, add the subnet for the EC2 instance.
If you have a VPC for provisioning new hosts, use its subnet.
. From the *Security Groups* list, select the cloud-based access rules for ports and IP addresses to apply to the host.
. From the *Managed IP* list, select either a `Public` IP or a `Private` IP.
. Click *Submit* to save the compute profile.

.CLI procedure
The compute profile CLI commands are not yet implemented in {ProjectName}.
As an alternative, you can include the same settings directly during the host creation process.

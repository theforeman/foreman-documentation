= Network Boot Provisioning Workflow

PXE booting assumes that a host, either physical or virtual, is configured to boot from network as the first booting device, and from the hard drive as the second booting device.

The provisioning process follows a basic PXE workflow:

. You create a host and select a domain and subnet.
{Project} requests an available IP address from the DHCP {SmartProxyServer} that is associated with the subnet or from the PostgreSQL database in {Project}.
{Project} loads this IP address into the *IP address* field in the Create Host window.
When you complete all the options for the new host, submit the new host request.
. Depending on the configuration specifications of the host and its domain and subnet, {Project} creates the following settings:
* A DHCP record on the {SmartProxyServer} that is associated with the subnet.
* A forward DNS record on the {SmartProxyServer} that is associated with the domain.
* A reverse DNS record on the DNS {SmartProxyServer} that is associated with the subnet.
* PXELinux, Grub, Grub2, and iPXE configuration files for the host in the TFTP {SmartProxyServer} that is associated with the subnet.
* A Puppet certificate on the associated Puppet server.
* A realm on the associated identity server.
. The new host requests a DHCP reservation from the DHCP server.
. The DHCP server responds to the reservation request and returns TFTP `next-server` and `filename` options.
. The host requests the boot loader and menu from the TFTP server according to the PXELoader setting.
. A boot loader is returned over TFTP.
. The boot loader fetches configuration for the host through its provisioning interface MAC address.
. The boot loader fetches the operating system installer kernel, init RAM disk, and boot parameters.
. The installer requests the provisioning template from {Project}.
. {Project} renders the provision template and returns the result to the host.
. The installer performs installation of the operating system.
ifeval::["{build}" == "foreman-el"]
* When Katello plugin is installed, the installer registers the host to {Project} using Red Hat Subscription Manager.
* When Katello plugin is installed, management tools such as `katello-agent` and `puppet` are installed.
endif::[]
ifeval::["{build}" == "satellite"]
* The installer registers the host to {Project} using Red Hat Subscription Manager.
* The installer installs management tools such as `katello-agent` and `puppet`.
endif::[]
* The installer notifies {Project} of a successful build in the `postinstall` script.
. The PXE configuration files revert to a local boot template.
. The host reboots.
. The new host requests a DHCP reservation from the DHCP server.
. The DHCP server responds to the reservation request and returns TFTP `next-server` and `filename` options.
. The host requests the bootloader and menu from the TFTP server according to the PXELoader setting.
. A boot loader is returned over TFTP.
. The boot loader fetches the configuration for the host through its provision interface MAC address.
. The boot loader initiates boot from the local drive.
. If you configured the host to use any Puppet classes, the host configures itself using the modules.

This workflow differs depending on custom options.
For example:

Discovery::
If you use the discovery service, {Project} automatically detects the MAC address of the new host and restarts the host after you submit a request.
Note that TCP port 8443 must be reachable by the {SmartProxy} to which the host is attached for {Project} to restart the host.

PXE-less Provisioning::
After you submit a new host request, you must boot the specific host with the boot disk that you download from {Project} and transfer using a USB port of the host.

Compute Resources::
{Project} creates the virtual machine and retrieves the MAC address and stores the MAC address in {Project}.
If you use image-based provisioning, the host does not follow the standard PXE boot and operating system installation.
The compute resource creates a copy of the image for the host to use.
Depending on image settings in {Project}, seed data can be passed in for initial configuration, for example using `cloud-init`.
{Project} can connect using SSH to the host and execute a template to finish the customization.

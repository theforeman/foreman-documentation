= Removing a Host From a Host Collection

The following procedure shows how to remove hosts from host collections.

Note that if you remove a host from a host collection, the host collection record in the database is not modified so the {Project} auditing system does not log the change.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Hosts* > *Host Collections*.
. Choose the desired host collection.
. On the *Hosts* tab, select the *List/Remove* subtab.
. Select the hosts you want to remove from the host collection and click *Remove Selected*.

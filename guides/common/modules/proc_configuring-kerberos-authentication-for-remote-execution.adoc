= Configuring Kerberos Authentication for Remote Execution

You can use Kerberos authentication to establish an SSH connection for remote execution on {Project} hosts.

.Prerequisites

Before you can use Kerberos authentication for remote execution on {ProjectName}, you must set up a Kerberos server for identity management and ensure that you complete the following prerequisites:

* Enroll {ProjectServer} on the Kerberos server
* Enroll the {Project} target host on the Kerberos server
* Configure and initialize a Kerberos user account for remote execution
* Ensure that the foreman-proxy user on {Project} has a valid Kerberos ticket granting ticket

.Procedure

To set up {Project} to use Kerberos authentication for remote execution on hosts, complete the following steps:

. To install and enable Kerberos authentication for remote execution, enter the following command:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# {installer-scenario} \
 --foreman-proxy-plugin-remote-execution-ssh-ssh-kerberos-auth true
----
+
. To edit the default user for remote execution, in the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Administer* > *Settings* and click the *RemoteExecution* tab. In the *SSH User* row, edit the second column and add the user name for the Kerberos account.
. Navigate to *remote_execution_effective_user* and edit the second column to add the user name for the Kerberos account.

To confirm that Kerberos authentication is ready to use, run a remote job on the host.

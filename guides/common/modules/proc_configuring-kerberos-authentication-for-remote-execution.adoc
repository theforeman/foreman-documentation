* Enroll the {Project} target host on the Kerberos server
* Configure and initialize a Kerberos user account for remote execution
* Ensure that the foreman-proxy user on {Project} has a valid Kerberos ticket granting ticket

+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# {installer-scenario} \

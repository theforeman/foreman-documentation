{Team} advises against using an existing system because the {Project} installer will affect the configuration of several components.
ifdef::satellite[]
Red{nbsp}Hat {ProductName} requires a {RHEL} installation with the `@Base` package group with no other package-set modifications, and without third-party configurations or software not directly necessary for the direct operation of the server.
This restriction includes hardening and other non-Red{nbsp}Hat security software.
If you require such software in your infrastructure, install and verify a complete working {ProductName} first, then create a backup of the system before adding any non-Red{nbsp}Hat software.

ifeval::["{context}" == "{smart-proxy-context}"]
Do not register {SmartProxyServer} to the Red{nbsp}Hat Content Delivery Network (CDN).

Red{nbsp}Hat does not support using the system for anything other than running {ProductName}.

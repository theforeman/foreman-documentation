You can install the operating system from a disc, local ISO image, kickstart, or any other method that Red{nbsp}Hat supports. Red{nbsp}Hat {ProductName} is supported only on the latest versions of {RHEL} 7 Server that is available at the time when {ProductName} {ProductVersion} is installed. Previous versions of Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise Linux including EUS or z-stream are not supported.

You can install the operating system from a disc, local ISO image, or kickstart.

The following operating systems are supported by the installer, have packages, and are tested for deploying {Project}:

.Operating Systems supported by {foreman-installer}
|====
| Operating System | Architecture | Notes
|  {RHEL} 7 |x86_64 only | EPEL is required.
Enable the Optional repository:

`yum-config-manager --enable rhel-7-server-optional-rpms`.

Use `yum repolist` to validate because the command can fail silently if your subscription does not provide it.

Apply all SELinux-related errata.
| CentOS, Scientific Linux or Oracle Linux 7 | x86_64 only | EPEL is required
| Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial) | amd64 |
| Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic) | amd64 |
| Debian 9 (Stretch) | amd64 |
|====

Other operating systems must use alternative installation methods, such as from source.

Before you install {Project}, apply all operating system updates if possible.

All operating systems require Puppet 5 or higher, which you can install from the operating system or the Puppet Labs repositories.

ifeval::["{build}" == "satellite"]
Red{nbsp}Hat {ProductName} requires a Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise Linux installation with the `@Base` package group with no other package-set modifications, and without third-party configurations or software not directly necessary for the direct operation of the server. This restriction includes hardening and other non-Red{nbsp}Hat security software. If you require such software in your infrastructure, install and verify a complete working {ProductName} first, then create a backup of the system before adding any non-Red{nbsp}Hat software.
endif::[]

Install {ProductName} on a freshly provisioned system.

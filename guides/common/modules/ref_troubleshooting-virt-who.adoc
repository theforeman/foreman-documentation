.Identifying issues when using multiple virt-who configuration files

If you have multiple virt-who configuration files on one server, move one file at a time to a different directory while testing after each file move.
If the issue no longer occurs, the cause is associated with the most recently moved file.
After you have resolved the issue, return the virt-who configuration files to their original location.

Alternatively, you can test an individual file after moving it by using the `--config` option to specify its location. For example:

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,verbatim"]
----
$ virt-who --debug --one-shot --config /tmp/_conf_name_.conf
----

.Identifying duplicate hypervisors

Duplicate hypervisors can cause subscription and entitlement errors. Enter the following commands to check for duplicate hypervisors:

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,verbatim"]
----
# systemctl stop virt-who
# virt-who -op >/tmp/virt-who.json
# systemctl start virt-who
# cat /tmp/virt-who.json | json_reformat | grep name | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -n10
  3    "name": "localhost"
  1    "name": "rhel1.example.com"
  1    "name": "rhel2.example.com"
  1    "name": "rhel3.example.com"
  1    "name": "rhel4.example.com"
  1    "name": "rhvh1.example.com"
  1    "name": "rhvh2.example.com"
  1    "name": "rhvh3.example.com"
  1    "name": "rhvh4.example.com"
  1    "name": "rhvh5.example.com"
----

In this example, three hypervisors have the same FQDN (`localhost`), and must be corrected to use unique FQDNs.

.Identifying duplicate virtual machines

Enter the following commands to check for duplicate virtual machines:

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,verbatim"]
----
# systemctl stop virt-who
# virt-who -op >/tmp/virt-who.json
# systemctl start virt-who
# cat /tmp/virt-who.json | json_reformat | grep "guestId" | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -n10
----

.Checking the number of hypervisors

Enter the following commands to check the number of hypervisors virt-who currently reports:

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,verbatim"]
----
# systemctl stop virt-who
# virt-who -op >/tmp/virt-who.json
# systemctl start virt-who
# cat /tmp/virt-who.json | json_reformat | grep name | sort | uniq -c | wc -l
----

.Checking the number of virtual machines

Enter the following commands to check the number of virtual machines that virt-who currently reports:

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,verbatim"]
----
# systemctl stop virt-who
# virt-who -op >/tmp/virt-who.json
# systemctl start virt-who
# cat /tmp/virt-who.json | json_reformat | grep "guestId" | sort | uniq -c | wc -l
----

[role="_abstract"]
If you encounter the following problems when using virt-who in {Project}, you might resolve them by using the following solutions.

virt-who does not report to {ProjectServer}::
+
--
virt-who might not report to {ProjectServer} if {ProjectServer} is configured to use a proxy server in `rhsm.conf` while virt-who is configured not to use a proxy server in `/etc/sysconfig/virt-who`.

The virt-who setting is ignored by the Subscription Manager.
As a result, virt-who attempts to connect to {ProjectServer} through a proxy server and fails.

To work around this problem, add the following parameter to the `/etc/rhsm/rhsm.conf` file:

[source,text]
----
no_proxy = server.example.com
----
--

Identifying issues when using multiple virt-who configuration files::
+
--
If you have multiple virt-who configuration files on one server, move one file at a time to a different directory while testing after each file move.
If the issue no longer occurs, the cause is associated with the most recently moved file.
After you have resolved the issue, return the virt-who configuration files to their original location.

Alternatively, you can test an individual file after moving it by using the `--config` option to specify its location. For example:

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,verbatim"]
----
$ virt-who --debug --one-shot --config /tmp/_conf_name_.conf
----
--

Identifying duplicate hypervisors::
+
--
Duplicate hypervisors can cause subscription and entitlement errors. Enter the following commands to check for duplicate hypervisors:

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,verbatim"]
----
# systemctl stop virt-who
# virt-who -op >/tmp/virt-who.json
# systemctl start virt-who
# cat /tmp/virt-who.json | json_reformat | grep name | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -n5
  3    "name": "localhost"
  1    "name": "rhel1.example.com"
  1    "name": "rhel2.example.com"
  1    "name": "rhel3.example.com"
  1    "name": "rhel4.example.com"
----

In this example, three hypervisors have the same FQDN (`localhost`), and must be corrected to use unique FQDNs.
--

Identifying duplicate virtual machines::
+
--
Enter the following commands to check for duplicate virtual machines:

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,verbatim"]
----
# systemctl stop virt-who
# virt-who -op >/tmp/virt-who.json
# systemctl start virt-who
# cat /tmp/virt-who.json | json_reformat | grep "guestId" | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -n10
----
--

Checking the number of hypervisors::
+
--
Enter the following commands to check the number of hypervisors virt-who currently reports:

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,verbatim"]
----
# systemctl stop virt-who
# virt-who -op >/tmp/virt-who.json
# systemctl start virt-who
# cat /tmp/virt-who.json | json_reformat | grep name | sort | uniq -c | wc -l
----
--

Checking the number of virtual machines::
+
--
Enter the following commands to check the number of virtual machines that virt-who currently reports:

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,verbatim"]
----
# systemctl stop virt-who
# virt-who -op >/tmp/virt-who.json
# systemctl start virt-who
# cat /tmp/virt-who.json | json_reformat | grep "guestId" | sort | uniq -c | wc -l

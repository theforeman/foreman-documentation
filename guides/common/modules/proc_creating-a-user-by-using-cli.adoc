= Creating a user by using Hammer CLI

[role="_abstract"]
Use this procedure to create a user by using Hammer CLI.

Users are strictly confined to their assigned organizations and locations.
Users can only access and assign resources within the organizations and locations they belong to.

.Procedure
* Create a user:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
$ hammer user create \
--auth-source-id _My_Authentication_Source_ \
--login _My_User_Name_ \
--mail _My_User_Mail_ \
--organization-ids _My_Organization_ID_1_,_My_Organization_ID_2_ \
--location-ids _My_Location_ID_1_,_My_Location_ID_2_ \
--password _My_User_Password_
----
+
Append `--auth-source-id 1` so that the user is authenticated internally.
Run `hammer auth-source list` to get a list of authentication sources.
Add the `--admin` option to grant administrator privileges to the user.
+
You can modify the user details later by using the `hammer user update` command.

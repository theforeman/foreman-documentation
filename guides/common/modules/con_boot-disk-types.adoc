= Boot disk types

You can generate the following types of boot disks:

ifndef::satellite[]
Generic image::
A boot ISO that is not associated with a specific host.
The ISO sends the MAC address of the host to {SmartProxy}, which matches the MAC address against the host entry.
The image does not store IP address details and requires access to a DHCP server on the network to bootstrap.
This image is also available from the `/disks/generic` URL on your {ProjectServer}, for example, `\https://{foreman-example-com}/disks/generic`.
+
This image is based on iPXE boot firmware.
Only a limited number of network cards is supported.
For more information, see https://ipxe.org/appnote/hardware_drivers[supported hardware drivers at ipxe.org].
endif::[]

Subnet image::
A boot ISO that is not associated with a specific host.
The ISO sends the MAC address of the host to {SmartProxy}, which matches the MAC address against the host entry.
The image does not store IP address details and requires access to a DHCP server on the network to bootstrap.
This image is generic to all hosts with a provisioning NIC on the same subnet.
+
This image is based on iPXE boot firmware.
Only a limited number of network cards is supported.
For more information, see https://ipxe.org/appnote/hardware_drivers[supported hardware drivers at ipxe.org].

ifndef::satellite[]
Host image::
A boot ISO for a specific host.
This image contains only the boot files that are necessary to access the installation media on {ProjectServer}.
You define the subnet data in {Project} and the image is created with static networking.
+
This image is based on iPXE boot firmware.
Only a limited number of network cards is supported.
For more information, see https://ipxe.org/appnote/hardware_drivers[supported hardware drivers at ipxe.org].
+
This image contains a provisioning security token, therefore the generated image has a limited lifespan.
For more information about configuring the security token, see xref:configuring-the-security-token-validity-duration[].
endif::[]

Full host image::
A boot ISO that contains the kernel and initial RAM disk image for a specific host.
This image is useful if the host fails to chainload correctly.
The provisioning template still downloads from {ProjectServer}.
+
This image is based on SYSLINUX and GRUB and works with most network cards.
+
This image contains a provisioning security token, therefore the generated image has a limited lifespan.
For more information about configuring the security token, see xref:configuring-the-security-token-validity-duration[].

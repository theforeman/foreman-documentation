= PXE booting

[role="_abstract"]
Preboot execution environment (PXE) provides the ability to boot a system over a network.
Instead of using local hard drives or a CD-ROM, PXE uses DHCP to provide host with standard information about the network, to discover a TFTP server, and to download a boot image.

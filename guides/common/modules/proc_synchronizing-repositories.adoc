[id="Synchronizing_Repositories_{context}"]
= Synchronizing Repositories

You must synchronize repositories to download content into {Project}.
You can use this procedure for an initial synchronization of repositories or to synchronize repositories manually as you need.

You can also sync all repositories in an organization.
For more information, see xref:Synchronizing_All_Repositories_in_an_Organization_{context}[].

Create a sync plan to ensure updates on a regular basis.
For more information, see xref:Creating_a_Sync_Plan_{context}[].

The synchronization duration depends on the size of each repository and the speed of your network connection.
The following table provides estimates of how long it would take to synchronize content, depending on the available Internet bandwidth:

= Services and features supported in a load-balanced setup

[role="_abstract"]
A load balancer in {Project} distributes load only for selected services and features so that host registration, content, and Puppet continue to work when one {SmartProxyServer} is unavailable.

The following services and features are supported for load balancing:

* Registering hosts
* Providing content to hosts
* Configuring hosts by using Puppet

Other {Project} services, such as provisioning, `virt-who`, or remote execution, go directly through the individual {SmartProxies} on which these services are running.

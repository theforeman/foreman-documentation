= How to Use ISS Based on Your Network Setup

There are different ways of using ISS to synchronize content between two {ProjectServer}s.
The way you can use depends on your multi-server setup that can fall to one of the following scenarios.

.ISS Network Sync in a Disconnected Scenario

* The upstream {ProjectServer} is connected to the Internet.
ifdef::satellite[]
This server synchronizes content from the Red Hat Content Delivery Network (CDN) or custom sources.
endif::[]
ifndef::satellite[]
This server synchronizes content from Content Delivery Networks (CDN) or custom sources.
endif::[]
* The downstream {ProjectServer} is completely isolated from all external networks.
* The downstream {ProjectServer} can communicate with a connected upstream {ProjectServer} over an internal network.

endif::[]

You can synchronize CDN and custom content from the upstream {ProjectServer} to the downstream {ProjectServer} over the network.

.ISS Export Sync in an Air-Gapped Scenario

* The upstream {ProjectServer} is connected to the Internet.
ifdef::satellite[]
This server synchronizes content from the Red Hat Content Delivery Network (CDN) or custom sources.
endif::[]
ifndef::satellite[]
This server synchronizes content from Content Delivery Networks (CDN) or custom sources.
endif::[]
* The downstream {ProjectServer} is completely isolated from all external networks.
* The downstream {ProjectServer} does not have a network connection to a connected upstream {ProjectServer}.

endif::[]

The only way for an air-gapped downstream {ProjectServer} to receive content updates is by exporting content from the upstream {ProjectServer}, bringing it physically to the downstream {ProjectServer} and importing the content.

You have two options how to synchronize your content using the export sync:

Using the Upstream {ProjectServer} as a Content Store::
The upstream {ProjectServer} is mainly used as a content store for updates.
The downstream {ProjectServer} serves as the main {ProjectServer} for managing content for all infrastructure behind the isolated network.
You manage Content Views and Lifecycle Environments on the downstream {ProjectServer}.

Using the Upstream {ProjectServer} for Managing Content View Versions::
The upstream {ProjectServer} is not only used as a content store, but also is used to manage content.
ifdef::satellite[]
Updates coming from the CDN are curated into Content Views and Lifecycle Environments.
endif::[]
ifndef::satellite[]
Updates coming from a CDN are curated into Content Views and Lifecycle Environments.
endif::[]
Once the content has been published to a designated Content View, the content can be exported and imported into the downstream {ProjectServer}.

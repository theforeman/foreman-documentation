= Creating hosts with PXE boot provisioning

PXE boot provisioning is a method of unattended host provisioning that requires minimal interaction during the process.

You enter the host details on {ProjectServer} and boot your host.
{ProjectServer} automatically manages the PXE configuration, organizes networking services, and provides the operating system and configuration for the host.

Create a host entry to add the host details.
When you save the host entry, {Project} creates the relevant provisioning settings.
This also includes creating the necessary directories and files for PXE booting.
When you boot the host, the host detects the DHCP service, receives the HTTP endpoint of the installation content, and installs the operating system.

During the installation, the host also registers to {ProjectServer} by using the activation key, installs the necessary host management tools from the {project-client-name} repository, and performs initial configuration.

= Managing Bookmarks

You can save search queries as bookmarks for reuse.
You can also delete or modify a bookmark.

Bookmarks appear only on the page on which they were created.
On some pages, there are default bookmarks available for the common searches, for example, all `active` or `disabled` hosts.

[id="Building_Cloud_Images_{context}"]
= Building Cloud Images for {ProjectName}

Use this section to build and register images to {ProjectName}.

You can use a preconfigured {RHEL} KVM guest QCOW2 image:

* https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/479/ver=/rhel---9/9.0/x86_64/product-software[Latest RHEL 9 KVM Guest Image]
* https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/479/ver=/rhel---8/8.0/x86_64/product-software[Latest RHEL 8 KVM Guest Image]


These images contain `cloud-init`.
To function properly, they must use ec2-compatible metadata services for provisioning an SSH key.

[NOTE]
====
For the KVM guest images:

* The `root` account in the image is disabled, but `sudo` access is granted to a special user named `cloud-user`.
* There is no `root` password set for this image.
The `root` password is locked in `/etc/shadow` by placing `!!` in the second field.

If you want to create custom {RHEL} images, see xref:Creating_a_RHEL7_Image_{context}[Creating a {RHEL} 7 Image] and xref:Creating_a_RHEL7_Image_{context}[Creating a {RHEL} 6 Image].

= Hammer authentication

A {Project} user must prove their identity to {ProjectName} when entering hammer commands.
Hammer commands can be run manually or automatically.
In either case, hammer requires {Project} credentials for authentication.
There are three methods of hammer authentication:

* Hammer authentication session
* Storing credentials in the hammer configuration file
* Providing credentials with each hammer command

The hammer configuration file method is recommended when running commands automatically.
For example, running {Project} maintenance commands from a cron job.
When running commands manually, {Team} recommends using the hammer authentication session and providing credentials with each command.

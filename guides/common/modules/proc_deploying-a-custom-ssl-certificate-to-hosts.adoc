= Deploying a Custom SSL Certificate to Hosts

After you configure {ProductName} to use a custom SSL certificate, you must also install the `katello-ca-consumer` package on every host that is registered to this {ProductName}.

Until https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1683835[BZ#1683835] is resolved, you cannot upgrade the `katello-ca-consumer` package; you must remove the old package and install the new one. Upgrading the `katello-ca-consumer` package fails because the upgrade reverts the `baseurl` setting in `rhsm.conf` to `subscription.rhsm.redhat.com`.

.Procedure

On each host, complete the following steps to install the `katello-ca-consumer` package:

. Delete the current `katello-ca-consumer` package on the host:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes"]
----
# yum remove 'katello-ca-consumer*'
----

. Install the `katello-ca-consumer` package on the host:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# yum localinstall \

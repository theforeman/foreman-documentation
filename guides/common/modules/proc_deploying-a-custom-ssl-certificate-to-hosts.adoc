= Deploying a Custom SSL Certificate to Hosts

After you configure {ProductName} to use a custom SSL certificate, you must also install the `katello-ca-consumer` package on every host that is registered to this {ProductName}.

ifeval::["{build}" != "foreman-deb"]
Until https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1683835[BZ#1683835] is resolved, you cannot upgrade the `katello-ca-consumer` package; you must remove the old package and install the new one. Upgrading the `katello-ca-consumer` package fails because the upgrade reverts the `baseurl` setting in `rhsm.conf` to `subscription.rhsm.redhat.com`.

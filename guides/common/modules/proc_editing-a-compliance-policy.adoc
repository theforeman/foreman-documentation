[id="Editing_a_Compliance_Policy_{context}"]
= Editing a Compliance Policy

In the {ProjectWebUI}, you can edit compliance policies.

An edited policy is applied to the host when its Puppet agent next checks with {ProjectServer} for updates.
By default, this occurs every 30 minutes.
If you use Ansible, you must run the Ansible role manually again or have configured a recurring remote execution job that runs the Ansible role on hosts.

.Prerequisite
* Your user account has the `view_policies` and `edit_policies` permissions.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Hosts* > *Compliance {endash} Policies*.
. Click the name of the required policy.
. Edit the necessary attributes.
. Click *Submit*.

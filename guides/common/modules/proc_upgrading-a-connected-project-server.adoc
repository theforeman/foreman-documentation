.Prerequisites
* If you have made manual edits to you DNS or DHCP configuration in the `/etc/zones.conf` or `/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf` files, ensure DNS and DHCP configuration management is disabled:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="attributes"]
----
# {foreman-installer} \
--foreman-proxy-dhcp-managed=false \
--foreman-proxy-dns-managed=false
----
+
This prevents the upgrade process from overwriting your DNS and DHCP configuration.

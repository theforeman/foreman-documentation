= Installing Flatpak applications on {Project} hosts

Use the command line to install selected applications from the enabled Flatpak remotes.

.Prerequisites
* Flatpak is installed on the host.
* Set up Flatpak on the host that consumes applications from {ProjectServer}.
For more information, see {RHELDocsBaseURL}9/html/administering_the_system_using_the_gnome_desktop_environment/assembly_installing-applications-using-flatpak_administering-the-system-using-the-gnome-desktop-environment#setting-up-flatpak_assembly_installing-applications-using-flatpak[Setting up Flatpak].
* Ensure that Flatpak runtime repositories are available to hosts alongside application repositories.
Flatpak applications, such as `rhel9/firefox-flatpak`, depend on the runtime for installation.
ifdef::satellite[]
* The {Team} Flatpak remote is enabled.
endif::[]
* Ensure that Podman is installed on the host.
* To install Flatpak applications from {Project}, ensure that your {Project} account has the `view_lifecycle_environments`, `view_products`, and `view_content_views` permissions, unless the lifecycle environment allows unauthenticated pull.
* Your {Project} account has a role that grants the `create_personal_access_tokens` permission to generate an access token for authentication.
The token generates automatically when you run `podman login`.

.Procedure
. On the managed host, add your {ProjectServer} as a Flatpak remote:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
$ flatpak remote-add --authenticator-name=org.flatpak.Authenticator.Oci katello oci+https://_{foreman-example-com}_/
----
. Log in the host to the container registry using one of the following methods: 
* Certificate authentication
** When registering a host to {Project} or {SmartProxy}, select the *Set up container registry certs* checkbox.
** If the host is already registered, run the *Flatpak - Login to registry via podman* job template on the host.
Set *Set up certificate authentication* to `true` and enter the URL of your {SmartProxy} as the registry URL.
* Using Podman
** Log in using Podman:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
$ podman login _{foreman-example-com}_
----
. Install your application.
For example, to install the Mozilla Firefox Flatpak:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
$ flatpak install firefox
----

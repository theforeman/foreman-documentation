[id="Configuring_Project_to_Use_LDAP_{context}"]
= Configuring {ProjectName} to use LDAP

In the {ProjectWebUI}, configure {Project} to use LDAP.

Note that if you need single sign-on functionality with Kerberos on {ProjectWebUI}, you should use {FreeIPA} and AD external authentication instead.
For more information, see xref:Using_FreeIPA_{context}[] or xref:Using_Active_Directory_{context}[].

.Procedure
. Set the Network Information System (NIS) service boolean to true to prevent SELinux from stopping outgoing LDAP connections:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# setsebool -P nis_enabled on
----
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Administer* > *LDAP Authentication*.
. Click *Create Authentication Source*.
. On the *LDAP server* tab, enter the LDAP server's name, host name, port, and server type.
The default port is 389, the default server type is POSIX (alternatively you can select FreeIPA or Active Directory depending on the type of authentication server).
For `TLS` encrypted connections, select the *LDAPS* checkbox to enable encryption.
The port should change to 636, which is the default for LDAPS.
. On the *Account* tab, enter the account information and domain name details.
See xref:Description_of_LDAP_Settings_{context}[] for descriptions and examples.
. On the *Attribute mappings* tab, map LDAP attributes to {Project} attributes.
You can map login name, first name, last name, email address, and photo attributes.
See xref:Example_Settings_for_LDAP_Connections_{context}[] for examples.
. On the *Locations* tab, select locations from the left table.
Selected locations are assigned to users created from the LDAP authentication source, and available after their first login.
. On the *Organizations* tab, select organizations from the left table.
Selected organizations are assigned to users created from the LDAP authentication source, and available after their first login.
. Click *Submit*.
. Configure new accounts for LDAP users:
+
* If you did not select *Automatically Create Accounts In {Project}* checkbox, see xref:Creating_a_User_{context}[] to create user accounts manually.
+
* If you selected the *Automatically Create Accounts In {Project}* checkbox, LDAP users can now log in to {Project} using their LDAP accounts and passwords.
After they log in for the first time, the {Project} administrator has to assign roles to them manually.
See xref:Assigning_Roles_to_a_User_{context}[] to assign user accounts appropriate roles in {Project}.

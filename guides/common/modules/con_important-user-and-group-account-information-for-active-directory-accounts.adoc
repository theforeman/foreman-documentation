= Important user and group account information for Active Directory accounts

All user and group accounts must be local accounts.
This is to ensure that there are no authentication conflicts between local accounts on your {ProjectServer} and accounts in your Active Directory domain.

Your system is not affected by this conflict if your user and group accounts exist in both `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/group` files.
For example, to check if entries for `puppet`, `{apache-user}`, `foreman` and `foreman-proxy` groups exist in both `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/group` files, enter the following commands:

[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# grep 'puppet\|{apache-user}\|foreman\|foreman-proxy' /etc/passwd /etc/group
----

= Multiple activation keys and content view environments

[role="_abstract"]
Registering a host with multiple activation keys assigns different attributes from each key, and their combined settings determine the configuration of the host.
Note that multiple activation keys and multiple content view environments are not the same.
Activation keys assign specific attributes to hosts during registration.
For instance, one activation key assigns system purpose attributes, another assigns repository set content overrides, and a third assigns the content view environments for the host.
When you register a host with these three activation keys, it inherits the system purpose attributes, content overrides, and content view environments from all the keys combined.

When multiple activation keys assign the same attributes, {Project} decides how to resolve conflicts.
In general, the host receives the union of non-conflicting settings and the setting from the last activation key for conflicting settings.

Conflicting settings, where the setting from the last activation key wins, include:

* System purpose attributes
* Release version

Non-conflicting settings, where the host receives the union of them, include:

* Host collections

Activation key behavior regarding multiple content view environments depends on the *Allow multiple content views* setting.
If you enable *Allow multiple content views*, content view environments are treated as non-conflicting.
If you disable *Allow multiple content views*, content view environments are considered conflicting.

When you enable *Allow multiple content views* and register a host with multiple activation keys, the host receives all content view environments from each activation key, in the order they are passed.

.Example with *Allow multiple content views* enabled
====

Assuming that:

* Activation key `ak_multi` assigns content view environments `dev/cv2`, `dev/cv3`.
* Activation key `ak4` assigns content view environments `dev/cv4`.

A host registered with activation keys `ak_multi` and `ak4` receives content view environments `dev/cv2`, `dev/cv3`, and `dev/cv4`.

If the order is reversed, with `ak4` followed by `ak_multi`, the host receives content view environments `dev/cv4`, `dev/cv2`, and `dev/cv3`.

====

When you disable *Allow multiple content views* and register a host with multiple activation keys, the host receives the content view environments from the last activation key with any content view environments.
If any of the activation keys is a multi-environment activation key, registration fails with an error, regardless of the order.

.Example with *Allow multiple content views* disabled
====

Assuming that:

* Activation key `ak_multi` assigns content view environments `dev/cv2`, `dev/cv3`.
* Activation key `ak4` assigns content view environment `dev/cv4`.
* Activation key `ak5` assigns content view environment `dev/cv5`.
* Activation key `ak_none` assigns no content view environments.

If you attempt to register a host with activation keys `ak_multi`, `ak4`, registration fails because `ak_multi` is a multi-environment activation key.

If you register a host with activation keys `ak4`, `ak5`, the host receives `dev/cv5`, as `ak5` is the last activation key with content view environments.

If you register a host with activation keys `ak4`, `ak5`, `ak_none`, the host receives `dev/cv5` because `ak5` is the last activation key with content view environments.

If you register a host with activation keys `ak5`, `ak4`, the host receives `dev/cv4`, as `ak4` is the last activation key with content view environments.

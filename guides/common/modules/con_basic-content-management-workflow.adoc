= Basic Content Management Workflow

This is a quick overview of the tasks involved in the basic content management workflow in {Project}.
If you have installed {Project} with Katello and want to synchronize and manage Enterprise Linux content on your hosts, follow the steps in this chapter.

* Create {customrepo} to mirror content from CentOS Stream.
* Synchronize the Content.
* Create `Activation Keys`.
* Register Hosts to consume this content.
* Manage RPMs on hosts using the `katello-agent`.

To view your newly created product, navigate to *Content* > *Products*, and select the name of the new product.

== Synchronizing Content from an Upstream Repository

Use the following procedure to mirror the contents of the upstream Centos repositories.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Content* > *Products*
. Select your new *CentOS Stream* product from the previous procedure.
. Locate the *AppStream x86_64 os* and *BaseOS x86_64 os* repositories.
. Select both repositories
. Click *Sync Now*

== Creating an Activation Key

. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Content* > *Activation keys* and click *Create Activation Key*.
. In the *Name* field, enter the name of the activation key.
. In the *Description* field, enter a description for the activation key.
. From the *Environment* list, select the *Library*.
. From the *Content View* list, select *Default Organization View*.

. Click *Add Selected* to save.

== Registering a CentOS Stream Host to {Project}

Use the following procedure to register an existing CentOS Stream host to {Project}

include::proc_host_registration_steps.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

== Using Content Views

{Project} uses the concept of Content Views to create snapshots of a set of repositories and make them available to hosts registered to it.
For example, if you want a group of hosts to have access to a specific version of a set of repositories, add those repositories to a Content View, publish and promote to a lifecycle environment.
You can then register hosts to this Content View.
These hosts have access only to repositories at the version specified in the Content View.
This means that you can continue to update repositories on your server while your hosts still consume only the versions of the repositories that they are registered to.
If you do not use Content Views and lifecycle environments, all your hosts consume content from the Default Content View and Library environment, which is a snapshot of the latest version of the content on your server.
For more information about content management using Content Views and application lifecycles, see:

* xref:Managing_Content_Views_content-management[]
* xref:Creating_an_Application_Life_Cycle_content-management[]

== Creating a Content View

Use the following procedure to create a Content view.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Content* > *Content Views* and click *Create New View*.
. In the *Name* field, enter *Centos content view*.
. In the *Description* field, enter a description for the Content View.
. Click *Save*.

== Adding Repositories

Use the following procedure to add the upstream CentOS repositories to your Content view.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Content* > *Content Views* > Select *CentOS content view* > *Yum Content* Dropdown> *Repositories*.
. Click on *Add* section on the Repository selection page.
. Locate the *AppStream x86_64 os* and *BaseOS x86_64 os* repositories.

. Click *Add Repositories*

== Publishing the Content View

Use the following procedure to publish the Content View.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Content* > *Content Views*, and select your new Content View.

== Creating an Activation Key to Consume the Content View

Use the following procedure to create an activation key that you can use to subscribe your hosts to content managed by {Project}.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Content* > *Activation keys* and click *Create Activation Key*.
. In the *Name* field, enter *CentOS* or the name of your new activation key.

. Click *Save*.
. Click the *Subscriptions* tab on the Activation Key's details page.
. Click the *Add* tab.
. Select your new *CentOS Stream* product in the table.
. Click *Add Selected* to save.

Use your activation key to register a host to the Content View.
For more information on registering a host, see {ManagingHostsDocURL}registering-a-host_managing-hosts[Registering a Host] in the _Managing Hosts Guide_.

== Registering a CentOS Stream host to consume content from published Content View

You can also register the host to the published Content View without an activation key using the following command:

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# subscription-manager register \
--environment="Library/Centos_Content_View"
--org="_My_Organization_" \
----

== Managing the Lifecycle of the Content View

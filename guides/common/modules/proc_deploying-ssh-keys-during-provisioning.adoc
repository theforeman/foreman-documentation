= Deploying SSH keys during provisioning

[role="_abstract"]
Deploy SSH keys added to a user during provisioning to establish secure, passwordless remote access to your newly provisioned hosts immediately after the installation.
For information on adding SSH keys to a user, see {AdministeringDocURL}managing-ssh-keys-for-a-user-by-using-web-ui[Managing SSH keys for a user by using {ProjectWebUI}] in _{AdministeringDocTitle}_.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Hosts* > *Templates* > *Provisioning Templates*.
. Create a provisioning template, or clone and edit an existing template.
For more information, see xref:creating-provisioning-templates-by-using-web-ui[].
. In the template, click the *Template* tab.
. In the *Template editor* field, add the `create_users` snippet to the `%post` section:
+
----
<%= snippet('create_users') %>
----
. Select the *Default* checkbox.
. Click the *Association* tab.
. From the *Application Operating Systems* list, select an operating system.
. Click *Submit* to save the provisioning template.
. Create a host that is associated with the provisioning template or rebuild a host using the operating system associated with the modified template.
+
The SSH keys of the *Owned by* user are added automatically when the `create_users` snippet is executed during the provisioning process.
You can set *Owned by* to an individual user or a user group.
If you set *Owned by* to a user group, the SSH keys of all users in the user group are added automatically.

= Automatic Contexts for Discovered Hosts

{ProjectServer} assigns an organization and location to discovered hosts automatically according to the following sequence of rules:

. If a discovered host uses a subnet defined in {Project}, the host uses the first organization and location associated with the subnet.
. If the default location and organization is configured in global settings, the discovered hosts are placed in this organization and location.
To configure these settings, navigate to *Administer* > *Settings* > *Discovery* and select values for the *Discovery organization* and *Discovery location* settings.
Ensure that the subnet of discovered host also belongs to the selected organization and location, otherwise {Project} refuses to set it for security reasons.
. If none of the previous conditions is met, {Project} assigns the first organization and location ordered by name.

You can change the organization or location manually by using the bulk actions on the *Discovered Hosts* page.
Select the discovered hosts to modify and, from the *Select Action* menu, select *Assign Organization* or *Assign Location*.

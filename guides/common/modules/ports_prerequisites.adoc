The following tables indicate the destination port and the direction of network traffic:

.Ports for Satellite to Red Hat CDN Communication
[cols="24%,20%,18%,38%",options="header"]
|====
| Port | Protocol | Service | Required For
| 443 | TCP | HTTPS | Subscription Management Services (access.redhat.com) and connecting to the Red{nbsp}Hat CDN (cdn.redhat.com).
|====

Except in the case of a disconnected Satellite, Satellite Server needs access to the Red{nbsp}Hat CDN. For a list of IP addresses used by the Red{nbsp}Hat CDN (cdn.redhat.com), see the Knowledgebase article https://access.redhat.com/articles/1525183[Public CIDR Lists for Red Hat] on the Red{nbsp}Hat Customer Portal.

.Ports for Browser-based User Interface Access to Satellite
[cols="24%,20%,18%,38%",options="header"]
|====
| Port | Protocol | Service | Required For
| 443 | TCP | HTTPS | Browser-based UI access to Satellite
| 80 | TCP | HTTP | Redirection to HTTPS for web UI access to Satellite (Optional)
|====

.Ports for Client to Satellite Communication
[cols="24%,20%,18%,38%",options="header"]
|====
| Port | Protocol | Service | Required For
| 80 | TCP | HTTP | Anaconda, yum, for obtaining Katello certificates, templates, and for downloading iPXE firmware
| 443 | TCP | HTTPS | Subscription Management Services, yum, Telemetry Services, and for connection to the Katello Agent
| 5647 | TCP | amqp | Katello Agent to communicate with Satellite's Qpid dispatch router
| 8000 | TCP | HTTP | Anaconda to download kickstart templates to hosts, and for downloading iPXE firmware
| 8140 | TCP | HTTPS | Puppet agent to Puppet master connections
| 9090 | TCP | HTTPS | Sending SCAP reports to the Smart Proxy in the
integrated Capsule, for the discovery image during provisioning,
and for communicating with Satellite Server to copy the SSH keys for Remote Execution (Rex) configuration
| 7 | TCP and UDP | ICMP | External DHCP on a Client to Satellite network, ICMP ECHO to verify IP address is free (Optional)
| 53 | TCP and UDP | DNS | Client DNS queries to a Satellite's integrated Capsule DNS service (Optional)
| 67 | UDP | DHCP | Client to Satellite's integrated Capsule broadcasts, DHCP broadcasts for Client provisioning from a Satellite's integrated Capsule (Optional)
| 69 | UDP |TFTP | Clients downloading PXE boot image files from a Satellites' integrated Capsule for provisioning (Optional)
| 5000 | TCP | HTTPS | Connection to Katello for the Docker registry (Optional)
|====

Any managed host that is directly connected to Satellite Server is a client in this context because it is a client of the integrated Capsule. This includes the base system on which a Capsule Server is running.

.Ports for Satellite to Capsule Communication
[cols="24%,20%,18%,38%",options="header"]
|====
| Port | Protocol | Service | Required for
| 443 |  TCP | HTTPS | Connections to the Pulp server in the Capsule

|====
| Port | Protocol | Service | Required For
| 22 | TCP | SSH | Satellite and Capsule originated communications, for Remote Execution (Rex) and Ansible.
| 443 | TCP | HTTPS | Satellite originated communications, for vCenter compute resource.
| 5000 | TCP | HTTP | Satellite originated communications, for compute resources in OpenStack or for running containers.
| 22, 16514 | TCP | SSH, SSL/TLS | Satellite originated communications, for compute resources in libvirt.
| 389, 636 | TCP | LDAP, LDAPS | Satellite originated communications, for LDAP and secured LDAP authentication sources.
| 5900 to 5930 | TCP | SSL/TLS | Satellite originated communications, for NoVNC console in web UI to hypervisors.

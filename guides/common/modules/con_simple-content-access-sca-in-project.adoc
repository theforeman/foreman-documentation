= Simple content access (SCA) in {ProjectName}

Simple Content Access (SCA) in {Project} simplifies management of software entitlements.
With SCA, you can add valid subscriptions to a subscription allocation or manifest and refresh within {Project}.
Therefore, with SCA enabled, you do not need to attach subscriptions individually to hosts.

[NOTE]
====
Simple Content Access (SCA) replaces the previous entitlement-based method of subscription management.
New organizations default to having SCA enabled.
Entitlement-based subscription management is deprecated.
For more information, see {ReleaseNotesDocURL}[_{ReleaseNotesDocTitle}_].

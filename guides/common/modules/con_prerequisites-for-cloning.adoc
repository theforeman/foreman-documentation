= Prerequisites for cloning

[role="_abstract"]
Ensure that your environment meets the following prerequisites before you can clone your {ProjectServer}.

To clone {ProjectServer}, ensure that you have the following resources available:

* A minimal install of {EL} 9 to become the target server.
Do not install {EL} 9 software groups or third-party applications.
Ensure that your server complies with all the required specifications.
For more information, see {InstallingServerDocURL}preparing-environment-for-{project-context}-server-installation_{project-context}[Preparing environment for {ProjectServer} installation] in _{InstallingServerDocTitle}_.
* A backup of your {ProjectServer} that you make using the `{foreman-maintain} backup` script.
You can use a backup with or without Pulp data.
* A {Project} subscription for the target server.

Before you begin cloning, ensure the following conditions exist:

* The target server is on an isolated network.
This prevents the cloned {ProjectServer} from accidentally communicating with the source {ProjectServer}, {SmartProxyServers}, and hosts.
* The target server has at least the same storage capacity as the source server.
* If you have any customized configurations on your source server that are not managed by the `{foreman-installer}` tool or {Project} backup process, you must manually back up these files.

[id="sharing-the-dhcp-configuration-files-and-lease-database-over-nfs"]
= Sharing the DHCP configuration files and lease database over NFS

The integration of an existing remote ISC DHCP service requires that you share the configuration file and lease database of the service over network.
For example, you can use the NFS service.
{Project} then uses NFS to access configuration settings, such as subnet definitions.
Read access to the lease database ensures efficient access to all lease information, which is not available over the ISC DHCP Object Management Application Programming Interface (OMAPI).

.Prerequisites
* The ISC DHCP service is deployed and functional.

.Procedure
. On {ProjectServer}, determine both the UID and the primary GID of the `foreman-proxy` user:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# id -u foreman-proxy
# id -g foreman-proxy
----
+
You require these IDs in the next steps.
. On the DHCP server, share the configuration of the DHCP service and lease database over NFS:
.. Create the `foreman-proxy` group with the same group ID as on the {ProjectServer}:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# groupadd -g _My_User_ID_ foreman-proxy
----
.. Create the `foreman-proxy` user with the same user ID and primary group ID as on the {ProjectServer}:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# useradd -u _My_User_ID_ -g _My_Group_ID_ -s /sbin/nologin foreman-proxy
----
.. Ensure that members of the `foreman-proxy` group can access the configuration file of the DHCP service:
+
[options="nowrap"]
----
# chgrp -R foreman-proxy /etc/dhcp/
# chmod g+rx /etc/dhcp/
# chmod g+r /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf
----
.. Install the `nfs-server` package:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# {package-install} {nfs-server-package}
----
.. Edit the `/etc/exports` file, and append share entries for the `/etc/dhcp/` and `/var/lib/dhcpd/` directories:
+
[source, none, options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
/etc/dhcp        _{foreman-example-com}_(ro)
/var/lib/dhcpd   _{foreman-example-com}_(ro)
----
Share the directories in read-only mode and only with the {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer}.
.. Enable and start the NFS server service:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# systemctl enable --now nfs-server
----
.. Open the NFSv4 port in the `firewalld` service:
+
[options="nowrap"]
----
# firewall-cmd --add-service=nfs
----
.. Make the changes persistent:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# firewall-cmd --runtime-to-permanent
----

.Next steps
* By default, the NFS protocol is unencrypted.
If you require an encrypted connection, configure NFS over TLS or Kerberos authentication after you completed this procedure.

= Remote Execution Workflow

When you run a remote job on hosts, for every host, {Project} performs the following actions to find a remote execution {SmartProxy} to use.


ifeval::["{context}" == "managing-hosts"]

{Project} searches only for {SmartProxies} that have the remote execution feature enabled.

endif::[]

ifeval::["{context}" == "ansible"]

{Project} searches only for {SmartProxies} that have the Ansible feature enabled.

endif::[]


. {Project} finds the host's interfaces that have the *Remote execution* check box selected.
. {Project} finds the subnets of these interfaces.
. {Project} finds remote execution {SmartProxies} assigned to these subnets.
. From this set of {SmartProxies}, {Project} selects the {SmartProxy} that has the least number of running jobs. By doing this, {Project} ensures that the jobs load is balanced between remote execution {SmartProxies}.
. If {Project} does not find a remote execution {SmartProxy} at this stage, and if the *Fallback to Any {SmartProxy}* setting is enabled, {Project} adds another set of {SmartProxies} to select the remote execution {SmartProxy} from. {Project} selects the most lightly loaded {SmartProxy} from the following types of {SmartProxies} that are assigned to the host:
+
* DHCP, DNS and TFTP {SmartProxies} assigned to the host's subnets
* DNS {SmartProxy} assigned to the host's domain
* Realm {SmartProxy} assigned to the host's realm
* Puppet Master {SmartProxy}
* Puppet CA {SmartProxy}
* OpenSCAP {SmartProxy}

+
. If {Project} does not find a remote execution {SmartProxy} at this stage, and if the *Enable Global {SmartProxy}* setting is enabled, {Project} selects the most lightly loaded remote execution {SmartProxy} from the set of all {SmartProxies} in the host's organization and location to execute a remote job.

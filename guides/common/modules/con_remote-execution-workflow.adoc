= Remote Execution Workflow

When you run a remote job on hosts, for every host, {Project} performs the following actions to find a remote execution {SmartProxy} to use.

ifeval::["{context}" == "managing-hosts"]
{Project} searches only for {SmartProxies} that have the remote execution feature enabled.
endif::[]

ifeval::["{context}" == "ansible"]
{Project} searches only for {SmartProxies} that have the Ansible feature enabled.
endif::[]

. {Project} finds the host's interfaces that have the *Remote execution* checkbox selected.
. {Project} finds the subnets of these interfaces.
. {Project} finds remote execution {SmartProxies} assigned to these subnets.
. From this set of {SmartProxies}, {Project} selects the {SmartProxy} that has the least number of running jobs.
By doing this, {Project} ensures that the jobs load is balanced between remote execution {SmartProxies}.

If you have enabled *Prefer registered through {SmartProxy} for remote execution*, {Project} runs the REX job using the {SmartProxy} the host is registered to.

By default, *Prefer registered through {SmartProxy} for remote execution* is set to *No*.
To enable it, in the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Administer* > *Settings*, and on the *Content* tab, set `Prefer registered through {SmartProxy} for remote execution` to *Yes*.
This ensures that {Project} performs REX jobs on hosts by the {SmartProxy} to which they are registered to.

If {Project} does not find a remote execution {SmartProxy} at this stage, and if the *Fallback to Any {SmartProxy}* setting is enabled, {Project} adds another set of {SmartProxies} to select the remote execution {SmartProxy} from.
{Project} selects the most lightly loaded {SmartProxy} from the following types of {SmartProxies} that are assigned to the host:

* DHCP, DNS and TFTP {SmartProxies} assigned to the host's subnets
* DNS {SmartProxy} assigned to the host's domain
* Realm {SmartProxy} assigned to the host's realm
* Puppet server {SmartProxy}
* Puppet CA {SmartProxy}
* OpenSCAP {SmartProxy}

If {Project} does not find a remote execution {SmartProxy} at this stage, and if the *Enable Global {SmartProxy}* setting is enabled, {Project} selects the most lightly loaded remote execution {SmartProxy} from the set of all {SmartProxies} in the host's organization and location to execute a remote job.

= Application Instances

An application instance is based on a preconfigured xref:Application_Definitions_{context}[].
You can use an application instance to automatically deploy and configure hosts based on its application definition and Ansible playbook.

Based on one application definition, end users can configure and deploy multiple application instances.

In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Applications > App Instances* to add, deploy, and remove application instances for application centric deployment.

= Creating ULN repositories

You can synchronize content from Oracle Unbreakable Linux Network (ULN) to {Project}.
There are two main differences compared to generic Yum content:

* The *Upstream URL* field consists of a protocol prefix `uln://` and an `ULN Channel Label`, for example, `ol7_x86_64_MySQL80_community`.
Combined, `uln://ol7_x86_64_MySQL80_community` is a valid upstream URL for a Yum repository.
* Authentication against the repository through an *Upstream Username* and *Upstream Password* is mandatory.
Use your single sign-on user name and token of your Oracle account to authenticate from {Project}.

For more information, see https://docs.oracle.com/en/operating-systems/oracle-linux/software-management/uln_generating_an_authentication_token.html[Generating an Authentication Token] in _Managing Software in Oracle Linux_.

To obtain a list of available ULN channel labels, log in to https://linux.oracle.com/[Oracle Unbreakable Linux Network].
Navigate to the *channels* tab and select an operating system release version and architecture.
Copy the required *ULN Channel Label* from the list of available content.

Adding ULN repositories is different compared to Yum repositories for {client-os}, for example, `\https://yum.oracle.com/oracle-linux-9.html`, which you can add as Yum-type content.

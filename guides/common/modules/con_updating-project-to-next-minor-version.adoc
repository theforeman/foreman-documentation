= Updating {Project} to the next minor version

You can update your {ProjectServer} and {SmartProxyServer} to a new minor release version, such as from {ProjectVersion}.0 to {ProjectVersion}.1, using the {Project} maintain tool.
The minor releases are non-disruptive to your operating environment and often fast.

You can update the underlying operating system.
If there are pending {ProjectServer} updates, updating the operating system will update both.

{Team} recommends performing updates regularly, because the minor releases patch security vulnerabilities and minor issues discovered after code is released.

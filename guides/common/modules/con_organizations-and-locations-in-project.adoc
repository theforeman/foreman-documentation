= Organizations and locations in {ProjectName}

On your {ProjectServer}, you can define organizations and locations to help organize content, hosts, and configurations.
Organizations and locations enable you to arrange {Project} resources into logically structured groups.
For example, you can create groups based on ownership, purpose, content, or security level.
ifdef::satellite[]
You can create and manage multiple organizations through {ProjectName}, then divide and assign your Red{nbsp}Hat subscriptions to each individual organization.
endif::[]
ifndef::satellite[]
You can create and manage multiple organizations through {ProjectName}, then divide and assign subscriptions to each individual organization.
endif::[]

Organizations::
Organizations typically represent different business units, departments, or teams, such as _Finance_, _Marketing_, or _Web Development_.
Each organization requires a separate Red{nbsp}Hat subscription manifest.
+
By creating organizations, you can create logical containers to isolate and manage their configurations separately according to their specific requirements.

Locations::
Locations typically represent physical locations, such as countries or cities.
+
By creating locations, you can define geographical sites where hosts are located.
For example, this is useful in environments with multiple data centers.
+
You can use locations to map the network infrastructure to prevent incorrect host placement or configuration.
While you cannot assign a subnet, domain, or compute resources directly to a {SmartProxyServer}, you can assign them to a location.
+
Unlike organizations, locations can have a hierarchical structure.

{ProjectServer} defines all locations and organizations.
Each {SmartProxyServer} synchronizes content and handles configuration of hosts in a different location.

Your {ProjectServer} retains the management function, while the content and configuration is synchronized between your {ProjectServer} and {SmartProxyServers} assigned to certain locations.


.Example of using organizations and locations in {Project}
====
The structure of a multi-national company includes the Finance, Marketing, and Sales departments.
The company operates across United States, United Kingdom, and Japan.

The system administrator creates the following organizations on their {ProjectServer}:

* Finance
* Marketing
* Sales

Additionally, the administrator creates the following locations on their {ProjectServer}:

* United States
* United Kingdom
* Japan

The administrator can define a nested location hierarchy to divide the United States location into additional locations based on specific cities:

* Boston
* Phoenix
* San Francisco

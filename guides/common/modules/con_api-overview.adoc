= {Project} API overview

You can write custom scripts and external applications that access the {Project} API over HTTP with the Representational State Transfer (REST) API provided by {ProjectServer}.
Use the REST API to integrate with enterprise IT systems and third-party applications, perform automated maintenance or error checking tasks, and automate repetitive tasks with scripts. 

Using the REST API has the following benefits:

* Configure any programming language, framework, or system with support for HTTP protocol to use the API.
* Create client applications that require minimal knowledge of the {Project} infrastructure because users discover many details at runtime.
* Adopt the resource-based REST model for intuitively managing a virtualization platform.

Scripts based on API commands communicate directly with the {Project} API, which makes them faster than scripts based on Hammer commands or Ansible playbooks relying on modules within {ansible-namespace}.

IMPORTANT: API commands differ between versions of {Project}.
When you prepare to upgrade {ProjectServer}, update all the scripts that contain {Project} API commands.

= Minimizing collected data 

[role="_abstract"]
You can configure {Project} to use minimal reporting if you want to limit the data sent to Red{nbsp}Hat.

You can use minimal reporting to limit the amount of system data sent to the Subscriptions service, which remains active.
Other {Insights} services are disabled because they require installed package data, which minimal reports do not include.
Reports are still processed daily during the midnight synchronization cycle.

Minimal reports also exclude hostnames, IP addresses, and installed packages.
Therefore, obfuscation and exclusion settings do not apply.

If you switch to *Analytics data collection*, {Project} enables the following settings by default:

* Obfuscate host names
* Obfuscate host ipv4 addresses
* Exclude installed packages

Review and adjust these settings to control what data {Project} shares.

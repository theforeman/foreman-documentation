[id="Loading_the_Default_SCAP_Contents_{context}"]
= Loading the default SCAP contents

By loading the default SCAP contents on {ProjectServer}, you ensure that the data streams from the SCAP Security Guide (SSG) are loaded and assigned to all organizations and locations.

SSG is provided by the operating system of {ProjectServer} and installed in `/usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/`.
Note that the available data streams depend on the operating system version on which {Project} runs.

You can only use this SCAP content to scan hosts that have the same minor RHEL version as your {ProjectServer}.
For more information, see xref:getting-supported-scap-contents-for-rhel_{context}[].

[IMPORTANT]
====
The default SCAP contents on {ProjectServer} get updated with new patch versions of {Project}.
They might not contain the latest available version of security policies but only the version that was available when the patch version was built.
If the policy files in `/usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/` were updated after a new patch version became available, follow the procedure below to load them into {Project}.

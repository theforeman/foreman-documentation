= Limiting host resources

[role="_abstract"]
You can use the Resource Quota plugin to limit users' access to host resources during host provisioning.
Each host is assigned to exactly one resource quota.
By default, {Project} assigns the `Unassigned` resource quota to hosts during global registration.
This means that the host is not assigned to a specific pool of resources.

In a typical usage scenario, {Project} manages multiple compute resources for multiple departments.
To share managed resources in a fair and predictable way, administrators can assign resource quotas to users and user groups.

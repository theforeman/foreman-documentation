= Limiting host resources

You can use the Resource Quota plugin to limit users' access to host resources during host provisioning.
Each host is assigned to exactly one resource quota.
By default, {Project} assigns the `Unassigned` resource quota to hosts during global registration.
This means that the host is not assigned to a specific pool of resources.

In a typical usage scenario, {Project} manages multiple compute resources for multiple departments.
To share managed resources in a fair and predictable way, administrators can assign resource quotas to users and user groups.

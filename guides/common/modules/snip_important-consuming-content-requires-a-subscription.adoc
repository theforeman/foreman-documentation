====
You can consume content from {Project} without registering your hosts to {Project} and/or without using `subscription-manager` to consume content, for example, in containerized build pipelines.
Any host that consumes content from {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServers} is considered a managed host that requires a valid {Project} subscription.

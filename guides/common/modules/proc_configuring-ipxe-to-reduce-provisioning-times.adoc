= Configuring iPXE to Reduce Provisioning Times

You can use {Project} to configure PXELinux to chainboot iPXE in BIOS mode and boot using the HTTP protocol if you have the following restrictions that prevent you from using PXE:

* A network with unmanaged DHCP servers.
* A PXE service that is blacklisted on your network or restricted by a firewall.
* An unreliable TFTP UDP-based protocol because of, for example, a low-bandwidth network.

ifndef::satellite[]
Only BIOS systems are known to work reliably.
For configuring iPXE with *some* EFI hosts, read a https://community.theforeman.org/t/discovery-ipxe-efi-workflow-in-foreman-1-20/13026[separate tutorial].

.iPXE Overview
iPXE is an open source network boot firmware.
It provides a full PXE implementation enhanced with additional features, including booting from HTTP server.
For more information, see https://ipxe.org[ipxe.org].

There are three methods of using iPXE with {ProjectName}:

. Booting virtual machines using hypervisors that use iPXE as primary firmware.
. Using PXELinux through TFTP to chainload iPXE directly on bare metal hosts.
. Using PXELinux through UNDI, which uses HTTP to transfer the kernel and the initial RAM disk on bare-metal hosts.

.Security Information
The iPXE binary in {RHEL} is built without some security features.
For this reason, you can only use HTTP, and cannot use HTTPS.
ifndef::satellite[]
Recompile iPXE from source to use security features like HTTPS.
endif::[]
ifdef::satellite[]
All security-related features of iPXE in {RHEL} are not supported.
For more information, see https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3483601[Red Hat Enterprise Linux HTTPS support in iPXE].
endif::[]

.Prerequisites
* A host exists on {ProjectName} to use.
* The MAC address of the provisioning interface matches the host configuration.
* The provisioning interface of the host has a valid DHCP reservation.
* The NIC is capable of PXE booting.
For more information, see https://ipxe.org/appnote/hardware_drivers[supported hardware on ipxe.org] for a list of hardware drivers expected to work with an iPXE-based boot disk.
* The NIC is compatible with iPXE.

To prepare iPXE environment, you must perform this procedure on all {SmartProxies}.

.Procedure
. Enable the *tftp* and *httpboot* services:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-installer} --foreman-proxy-httpboot true --foreman-proxy-tftp true
----
. Install the `ipxe-bootimgs` RPM package:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# {package-install} ipxe-bootimgs
----
ifdef::foreman-el,katello[]
. On Debian/Ubuntu, install the `ipxe` .deb package:
+
----
# {package-install} ipxe
----
endif::[]
ifdef::foreman-el,katello[]
. On systems with SELinux, correct the file contexts:
+
----
# restorecon -RvF /var/lib/tftpboot/
----
endif::[]
ifdef::satellite,orcharhino[]
. Correct the SELinux file contexts:
+
----
# restorecon -RvF /var/lib/tftpboot/
----
endif::[]

* Copy the iPXE firmware with the Linux kernel header to the TFTP directory:
+
----
# cp /usr/share/ipxe/ipxe.lkrn /var/lib/tftpboot/
----

* Copy the UNDI iPXE firmware to the TFTP directory:
+
----
# cp /usr/share/ipxe/undionly.kpxe /var/lib/tftpboot/undionly-ipxe.0
----

. Optionally, configure Foreman discovery.
For more information, see xref:Configuring_the_Discovery_Service_{context}[].
* In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Administer* > *Settings*, and click the *Provisioning* tab.
* Locate the *Default PXE global template entry* row and in the *Value* column, change the value to *discovery*.

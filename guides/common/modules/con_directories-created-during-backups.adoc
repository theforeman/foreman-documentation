{Project} organizes backups in time-stamped subdirectories, which helps you identify and select the correct backup when restoring your system.

The `{foreman-maintain} backup` command creates a time-stamped subdirectory in the backup directory that you specify.
The `{foreman-maintain} backup` command does not overwrite backups, therefore you must select the correct directory or subdirectory when restoring from a backup or an incremental backup.
The `{foreman-maintain} backup` command stops and restarts services as required.

When you run the `{foreman-maintain} backup offline` command, the following default backup directories are created:

* `{project-context}-backup` on {Project}
* `foreman-proxy-backup` on {SmartProxy}

If you want to set a custom directory name, add the `--preserve-directory` option and add a directory name.
The backup is then stored in the directory you provide in the command line.
If you use the `--preserve-directory` option, no data is removed if the backup fails.

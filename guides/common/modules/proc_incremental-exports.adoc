= Incremental Exports

Exporting complete versions can be a very expensive operation on storage space and resources.
ifdef::orcharhino[]
The size of the exported Content View versions depends on the number of products.
endif::[]
Content View versions that have multiple {RHEL} trees can occupy several gigabytes of the space on {ProjectServer}.

You can use the *Incremental Export* functionality to help reduce demands on your infrastructure.
*Incremental Export* exports only content that changes from the previously exported version.
Generally, incremental changes are smaller than full exports.
ln the following example, since version `1.0` has already been exported and the command targets version 2.0 for export.

.Procedure

+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]

--content-view="_Content_View_Name_" \
--organization="_My_Organization_" \
--version=2.0
----
. Optional: View the exported Content View:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# ls -lh /var/lib/pulp/exports/_My_Organization_/view/2.0/2021-02-25T21-45-34-00-00/

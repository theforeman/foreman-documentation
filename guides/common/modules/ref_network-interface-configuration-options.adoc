= Network interface configuration options

When adding a network interface, you need to specify several configuration options. The following lists provide information on the relevant options for the different types of interfaces.

.Physical interface settings

*Device Identifier*:: The identifier is used to specify this physical interface when creating bonded interfaces, VLANs, and aliases.

*DNS name*:: {Project} saves this name in the {SmartProxyServer} associated with the selected domain (the "DNS A" field) and {SmartProxyServer} associated with the selected subnet (the "DNS PTR" field).
A single host can therefore have several DNS entries.

*Domain*:: Specifies the domain associated with the network interface. To create and manage domains, navigate to *Infrastructure* > *Domains*.

*Subnet*:: Specifies the subnet associated with the network interface. To create and manage subnets, navigate to *Infrastructure* > *Subnets*.

*Managed* interface:: If the interface is managed, configuration is pulled from the associated {SmartProxyServer} during provisioning, and DNS and DHCP entries are created.
If you use provisioning with installer automation, a configuration file is automatically created for the interface.

*Primary* interface:: The DNS name from the primary interface is used as the host portion of the FQDN.

*Provision*:: TFTP boot takes place using the provisioning interface.
For image-based provisioning, the script to complete the provisioning is executed through the provisioning interface.

.Virtual interface settings

*Tag*:: You can set a VLAN tag to trunk a network segment from the physical network through to the virtual interface.
** If you do not specify a tag, managed interfaces inherit the VLAN tag of the associated subnet.
** User-specified entries from this field are not applied to alias interfaces.

.Bonded interface settings

*Mode*:: The bonding mode defines a policy for fault tolerance and load balancing.
See xref:Bonding_Modes_Available_{context}[] for a brief description of each bonding mode.

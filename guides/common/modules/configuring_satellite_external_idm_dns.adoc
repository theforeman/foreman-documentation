= Configuring Satellite or Capsule with External IdM DNS

Red{nbsp}Hat Satellite can be configured to use a Red{nbsp}Hat Identity Management (IdM) server to provide the DNS service. Two methods are described here to achieve this, both using a transaction key. For more information on Red{nbsp}Hat Identity Management, see the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Linux_Domain_Identity_Authentication_and_Policy_Guide/[Linux Domain Identity, Authentication, and Policy Guide].

The first method is to install the IdM client which automates the process with the _generic security service algorithm for secret key transaction_ (GSS-TSIG) technology defined in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3645[RFC3645]. This method requires installing the IdM client on the Satellite Server or Capsule's base system and having an account created by the IdM server administrator for use by the Satellite administrator. See xref:configuring_dynamic_dns_Update_with_gss-tsig_authentication[] to use this method.

The second method, _secret key transaction authentication for DNS_ (TSIG), uses an `rndc.key` for authentication. It requires root access to the IdM server to edit the BIND configuration file, installing the `BIND` utility on the Satellite Server's base system, and coping the `rndc.key` to between the systems. This technology is defined in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2845[RFC2845]. See xref:configuring_dynamic_dns_update_with_tsig_authentication[] to use this method.

[NOTE]
You are not required to use Satellite to manage DNS. If you are using the Realm enrollment feature of Satellite, where provisioned hosts are enrolled automatically to IdM, then the `ipa-client-install` script creates DNS records for the client. The following procedure and Realm enrollment are therefore mutually exclusive. For more information on configuring Realm enrollment, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_satellite/{ProductVersion}/html/administering_red_hat_satellite/chap-red_hat_satellite-administering_red_hat_satellite-configuring_external_authentication#sect-Red_Hat_Satellite-Administering_Red_Hat_Satellite-Configuring_External_Authentication-External_Authentication_for_Provisioned_Hosts[External Authentication for Provisioned Hosts] in _Administering Red Hat Satellite_.

.Determining where to install the IdM Client

When Satellite Server wants to add a DNS record for a host, it first determines which Capsule is providing DNS for that domain. It then communicates with the Capsule and adds the record. The hosts themselves are not involved in this process. This means you should install and configure the IdM client on the Satellite or Capsule that is currently configured to provide a DNS service for the domain you want to manage using the IdM server.

== Configuring Dynamic DNS Update with GSS-TSIG Authentication

In this example, Satellite Server has the following settings.
[cols="50%,50%"]
|====
|Host name | `satellite.example.com`
| Network  | `192.168.55.0/24`
|====

The IdM server has the following settings.
[cols="50%,50%"]
|====
|Host name   |     `idm1.example.com`
|Domain name |    `example.com`
|====


.Before you Begin.

. Confirm the IdM server is deployed and the host-based firewall has been configured correctly. For more information, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Linux_Domain_Identity_Authentication_and_Policy_Guide/installing-ipa.html#prereq-ports[Port Requirements] in the _Linux Domain Identity, Authentication, and Policy Guide_.
. Obtain an account on the IdM server with permissions to create zones on the IdM server.
. Confirm if the Satellite or an external Capsule is managing DNS for a domain.
. Confirm that the Satellite or external Capsule are currently working as expected.
. In the case of a newly installed system, complete the installation procedures in this guide first. In particular, DNS and DHCP configuration should have been completed.
. Make a backup of the answer file in case you have to revert the changes. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_satellite/{ProductVersion}/html/installing_satellite_server_from_a_connected_network/#specifying_installation_options[Specifying Installation Options] for more information.

.Create a Kerberos Principal on the IdM Server.

. Ensure you have a Kerberos ticket.

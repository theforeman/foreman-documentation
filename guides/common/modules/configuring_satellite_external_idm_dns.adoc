= Configuring {Project} or {SmartProxy} with External IdM DNS

{ProjectName} can be configured to use a Red{nbsp}Hat Identity Management (IdM) server to provide the DNS service. Two methods are described here to achieve this, both using a transaction key. For more information on Red{nbsp}Hat Identity Management, see the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Linux_Domain_Identity_Authentication_and_Policy_Guide/[Linux Domain Identity, Authentication, and Policy Guide].

The first method is to install the IdM client which automates the process with the _generic security service algorithm for secret key transaction_ (GSS-TSIG) technology defined in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3645[RFC3645]. This method requires installing the IdM client on the {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxy}'s base system and having an account created by the IdM server administrator for use by the {Project} administrator. See xref:configuring_dynamic_dns_Update_with_gss-tsig_authentication[] to use this method.

The second method, _secret key transaction authentication for DNS_ (TSIG), uses an `rndc.key` for authentication. It requires root access to the IdM server to edit the BIND configuration file, installing the `BIND` utility on the {ProjectServer}'s base system, and coping the `rndc.key` to between the systems. This technology is defined in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2845[RFC2845]. See xref:configuring_dynamic_dns_update_with_tsig_authentication[] to use this method.

[NOTE]
You are not required to use {Project} to manage DNS. If you are using the Realm enrollment feature of {Project}, where provisioned hosts are enrolled automatically to IdM, then the `ipa-client-install` script creates DNS records for the client. The following procedure and Realm enrollment are therefore mutually exclusive. For more information on configuring Realm enrollment, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_satellite/{ProductVersion}/html/administering_red_hat_satellite/chap-red_hat_satellite-administering_red_hat_satellite-configuring_external_authentication#sect-{Project_Link}-Administering_{Project_Link}-Configuring_External_Authentication-External_Authentication_for_Provisioned_Hosts[External Authentication for Provisioned Hosts] in _Administering {ProjectName}_.

.Determining where to install the IdM Client

When {ProjectServer} wants to add a DNS record for a host, it first determines which {SmartProxy} is providing DNS for that domain. It then communicates with the {SmartProxy} and adds the record. The hosts themselves are not involved in this process. This means you should install and configure the IdM client on the {Project} or {SmartProxy} that is currently configured to provide a DNS service for the domain you want to manage using the IdM server.

[[configuring_dynamic_dns_Update_with_gss-tsig_authentication]]
== Configuring Dynamic DNS Update with GSS-TSIG Authentication

In this example, {ProjectServer} has the following settings.
[cols="50%,50%"]
|====
|Host name | `{foreman-example-com}`
| Network  | `192.168.55.0/24`
|====

The IdM server has the following settings.
[cols="50%,50%"]
|====
|Host name   |     `idm1.example.com`
|Domain name |    `example.com`
|====


.Before you Begin.

. Confirm the IdM server is deployed and the host-based firewall has been configured correctly. For more information, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Linux_Domain_Identity_Authentication_and_Policy_Guide/installing-ipa.html#prereq-ports[Port Requirements] in the _Linux Domain Identity, Authentication, and Policy Guide_.
. Obtain an account on the IdM server with permissions to create zones on the IdM server.
. Confirm if the {Project} or an external {SmartProxy} is managing DNS for a domain.
. Confirm that the {Project} or external {SmartProxy} are currently working as expected.
. In the case of a newly installed system, complete the installation procedures in this guide first. In particular, DNS and DHCP configuration should have been completed.
. Make a backup of the answer file in case you have to revert the changes. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_satellite/{ProductVersion}/html/installing_satellite_server_from_a_connected_network/#specifying_installation_options[Specifying Installation Options] for more information.

.Create a Kerberos Principal on the IdM Server.

. Ensure you have a Kerberos ticket.
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# kinit _idm_user_
----
Where _idm_user_ is the account created for you by the IdM administrator.

. Create a new Kerberos principal for the {Project} or {SmartProxy} to use to authenticate to the IdM server.
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# ipa service-add capsule/_{foreman-example-com}_
----

.Install and Configure the IdM Client.

Do this on the {Project} or {SmartProxyServer} that is managing the DNS service for a domain.

. Install the `ipa-client` package on {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer}:
+
* On {ProjectServer}, enter the following command:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} packages install ipa-client
----
+
* On {SmartProxyServer}, enter the following command:
+
----
# yum install ipa-client

. Configure the IdM client by running the installation script and following the on-screen prompts.
+
[options="nowrap"]
----
# ipa-client-install
----

. Ensure you have a Kerberos ticket.
+
[options="nowrap"]
----
# kinit admin

----
[NOTE]
When adding a keytab to a standby system with the same host name as the original system in service, add the `r` option to prevent generating new credentials and rendering the credentials on the original system invalid.
+
. Set the group and owner for the keytab file to `foreman-proxy` as follows.
+
[options="nowrap"]
----
# chown foreman-proxy:foreman-proxy /etc/foreman-proxy/dns.keytab
----

. If required, check the keytab is valid.

.Testing External Updates to the DNS Zone in the IdM Server

. Install `bind-utils` for testing with `nsupdate`.
+
----
# yum install bind-utils
----

. Ensure the key in the `/etc/rndc.key` file on {ProjectServer} is the same one as used on the IdM server.
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
key "rndc-key" {
        algorithm hmac-md5;
        secret "_secret-key_==";
};
----

. On {ProjectServer}, create a test DNS entry for a host. For example, host `_test.example.com_` with an A record of `192.168.25.20` on the IdM server at `192.168.25.1`.
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]

Address:	192.168.25.1#53

Name:	test.example.com
Address: 192.168.25.20
----

. To view the entry in the IdM web UI, go to *Network Services* > *DNS* > *DNS Zones*. Select the name of the zone and search for the host by name.

. If resolved successfully, remove the test DNS entry.
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# echo -e "server 192.168.25.1\n \
update delete _test.example.com_ 3600 IN A 192.168.25.20\n \

----

. Confirm that the DNS entry was removed.
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# nslookup _test.example.com_ 192.168.25.1
----
The above `nslookup` command fails and returns the SERVFAIL error message if the record was successfully deleted.

= Exporting the Library Environment Incrementally in a Syncable Format

Exporting Library content can be a very costly operation in terms of system resources.
ifdef::orcharhino[]
The size of the exported Library depends on the number of products.
endif::[]
Organizations that have multiple {RHEL} trees can occupy several gigabytes of space on {ProjectServer}.

In such cases, you can use *Incremental Export* to export only pieces of content that changed since the previous export.
Incremental exports typically result in smaller archive files than full exports.

The procedure below shows incremental export of all repositories in the organization's Library.

.Procedure
. Create an incremental export:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer content-export incremental library \
--format=syncable \
--organization="_My_Organization_"
----
. Optional: View the exported data:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# find /var/lib/pulp/exports/Default_Organization/Export-Library-SYNCABLE/2.0/2023-03-09T10-55-48-05-00/ -name "*.rpm"

= Disabling DNS for integration

If you want to manually manage a DNS service and not integrate it into {ProjectServer}, you must prevent {Project} from maintaining this service on the operating system and disable orchestration to avoid errors.

[NOTE]
====
Disabling DNS in {Project} does not remove the related backend service on the operating system.

[NOTE]
====
{Project} does not perform orchestration when a {SmartProxy} is not set for a given subnet and domain.
When you disable {SmartProxy} associations, orchestration commands for existing hosts can fail if the expected records and configuration files are not present.

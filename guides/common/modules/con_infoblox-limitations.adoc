All DHCP and DNS records can be managed only in a single Network or DNS view.
After you install the Infoblox modules on {ProductName} and set up the view using the `{foreman-installer}` command, you cannot edit the view.

{ProductName} communicates with a single Infoblox node by using the standard HTTPS web API.
If you want to configure clustering and High Availability, make the configurations in Infoblox.

Hosting PXE-related files by using the TFTP functionality of Infoblox is not supported.
You must use {ProductName} as a TFTP server for PXE provisioning.
For more information, see {ProvisioningDocURL}Configuring_Networking_provisioning[Configuring networking] in _{ProvisioningDocTitle}_.

{Project} IPAM feature cannot be integrated with Infoblox.

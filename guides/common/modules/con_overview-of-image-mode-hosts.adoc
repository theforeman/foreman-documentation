= Overview of image mode hosts

{Project} identifies an image mode host as any system that reports a container image from its bootc status through Subscription Manager. 
It classifies all other hosts as package mode hosts.

Image mode simplifies enterprise operations by enabling development, operations, and solution providers to use the same container-native tools and techniques to manage both applications and the underlying operating system.

.Image mode hosts
Image mode hosts include additional fields that reflect their boot status.
These fields track the container images used in various scenarios:

* *Booted Image & Digest*: Indicates the container image the host is currently using.
* *Staged Image & Digest*: Indicates the container image the host uses after the next reboot.
* *Available Image & Digest*: Represents the container image cached by running `bootc upgrade --check`.
* *Rollback Image & Digest*: Represents the container image the host reverts to after the next reboot if `Bootc rollback` is applied.

.Additional resources
{Project} enables registration, monitoring, and update support for image mode hosts. 
Register image mode hosts like any other host, view their `bootc` statuses in a centralized location, and trigger updates remotely using remote execution. 
For more information on image mode concepts, refer to the https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/image-mode-red-hat-enterprise-linux-quick-start-guide[RHEL Image Mode quick start guide].
You can display a column in the New UI of the *All Hosts* page that includes a mode indicator. 
This column is disabled by default, so enabling it views mode information.

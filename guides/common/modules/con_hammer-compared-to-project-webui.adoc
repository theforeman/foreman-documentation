= Hammer compared to {ProjectWebUI}

Compared to navigating the {ProjectWebUI}, using Hammer can result in much faster interaction with the {ProjectServer}, as common shell features such as environment variables and aliases are at your disposal.
You can also incorporate Hammer commands into reusable scripts for automating tasks of various complexity.
Output from Hammer commands can be redirected to other tools, which allows for integration with your existing environment.
You can issue Hammer commands directly on the base operating system running {ProjectName}.

Access to base operating system on {ProjectServer} is required to issue Hammer commands, which can limit the number of potential users compared to the {ProjectWebUI}.
Although the parity between Hammer and the {ProjectWebUI} is almost complete, the {ProjectWebUI} has development priority and can be ahead especially for newly introduced features.

= Configuring a host to use the pull client

For {SmartProxies} configured to use `pull-mqtt` mode, hosts can subscribe to remote jobs using the remote execution pull client.
Hosts do not require an SSH connection from their {SmartProxyServer}.

.Prerequisites
* You have registered the host to {Project}.
* The {SmartProxy} through which the host is registered is configured to use `pull-mqtt` mode.
For more information, see {InstallingSmartProxyDocURL}configuring-remote-execution-for-pull-client_{smart-proxy-context}[Configuring pull-based transport for remote execution] in _{InstallingSmartProxyDocTitle}_.
* The {Team} {project-client-name} repository is enabled and synchronized on {ProjectServer}, and enabled on the host.
* The host can communicate with its {SmartProxy} over MQTT using port `1883`.
* The host can communicate with its {SmartProxy} over HTTPS.

.Procedure
* Install the `katello-pull-transport-migrate` package on your host:
ifdef::client-content-dnf[]
** On {EL} 9 and {EL} 8 hosts:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# {client-package-install-el8} katello-pull-transport-migrate
----
ifdef::orcharhino,satellite[]
** On {EL} 7 hosts:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# {client-package-install-el7} katello-pull-transport-migrate
----
endif::[]
endif::[]
ifdef::client-content-apt[]
** On {DL} hosts:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# {client-package-install-deb} katello-pull-transport-migrate
----
endif::[]
ifdef::client-content-zypper[]
** On {SLES} hosts:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# {client-package-install-sles} katello-pull-transport-migrate
----
endif::[]

+
The package installs `foreman_ygg_worker` and `yggdrasil` as dependencies, configures the `yggdrasil` client, and starts the pull client worker on the host.

.Verification
* Check the status of the `yggdrasild` service:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# systemctl status yggdrasild

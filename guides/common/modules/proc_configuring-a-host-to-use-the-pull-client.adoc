= Configuring a Host to Use the Pull Client

For {SmartProxies} configured to use `pull-mqtt` mode, hosts can subscribe to remote jobs using the remote execution pull client.
Managed hosts do not require an SSH connection to their {SmartProxyServer}.

.Prerequisites
* You have registered the host to {Project}.
* The host's {SmartProxy} is configured to use `pull-mqtt` mode.
For more information, see {InstallingSmartProxyDocURL}configuring-remote-execution-for-pull-client_{smart-proxy-context}[Configuring Remote Execution for Pull Client] in _{InstallingSmartProxyDocTitle}_.
* The {Team} {project-client-name} repository is enabled and synchronized on {ProjectServer}, and enabled on the host.
* The host is able to communicate with its {SmartProxy} over MQTT using port `1883`.
* The host is able to communicate with its {SmartProxy} over HTTPS.

NOTE: The `katello-pull-transport-migrate` package was created to help users migrate from Katello Agent to remote execution with the pull client.
However, having Katello Agent installed on the host is not a requirement.
You can use `katello-pull-transport-migrate` regardless of whether Katello Agent is installed.

.Procedure
. Install the `katello-pull-transport-migrate` package on your host:
** On {EL} 8 and {EL} 9 hosts:
+
----
# dnf install katello-pull-transport-migrate
----
** On {EL} 7 hosts:
+
----
# yum install katello-pull-transport-migrate
----

+
The package installs `foreman_ygg_worker` and `yggdrasil` as dependencies and enables the pull mode on the host.
The host's `subscription-manager` configuration and consumer certificates are used to configure the `yggdrasil` client on the host, and the pull mode client worker is started.
. Optional: To verify that the pull client is running and configured properly, check the status of the `yggdrasild` service:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# systemctl status yggdrasild
----
. Optional: After the package is installed, you can remove `katello-agent` from the host.
+
WARNING: If your host is installed on {oVirt} version 4.4 or lower, do not remove the `katello-agent` package because the removed dependencies corrupt the host.

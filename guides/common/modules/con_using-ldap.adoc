= Using LDAP

{Project} supports LDAP authentication using one or multiple LDAP directories.

If you require {ProjectName} to use `TLS` to establish a secure LDAP connection (LDAPS), first obtain certificates used by the LDAP server you are connecting to and mark them as trusted on the base operating system of your {ProjectServer} as described below.
If your LDAP server uses a certificate chain with intermediate certificate authorities, all of the root and intermediate certificates in the chain must be trusted, so ensure all certificates are obtained.
If you do not require secure LDAP at this time, proceed to xref:Configuring_Project_to_Use_LDAP_{context}[].

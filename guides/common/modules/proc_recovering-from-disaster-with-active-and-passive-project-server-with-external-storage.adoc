= Recovering from disaster with active and passive server with external storage

If your active {ProjectServer} fails, detach it from the shared storage and make sure your passive server can access the data stored on the shared storage.
This turns the passive server into your new active server.

.Procedure
. Verify that the failed active server is powered off or fully detached from the shared storage.
This ensures that the failed server cannot keep writing to the shared storage.
. Switch DNS records of the active server with the DNS records of the passive server.
This ensures that hosts remain connected and you do not need to re-register them.
. If your shared storage was mounted on both your active and passive servers, your passive server can already access the data.
. If your shared storage was mounted only on your active server, re-mount it on your passive server.
. Assess the functionality of your new active {ProjectServer}.

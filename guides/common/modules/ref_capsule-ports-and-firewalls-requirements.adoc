[id="capsule-ports-and-firewalls-requirements_{context}"]

The following tables indicate the destination port and the direction of network traffic:

.Ports for {SmartProxy} to {Project} Communication
[cols="24%,20%,18%,38%",options="header"]
|====
| Port | Protocol | Service | Required For
| 5646   | TCP   |  amqp   |  {SmartProxy}'s Qpid dispatch router to Qpid dispatch router in {Project}
|====

.Ports for Client to {SmartProxy} Communication
[cols="24%,20%,18%,38%",options="header"]
|====
|Port |Protocol |Service |Required for
|80 |TCP |HTTP |Anaconda, yum, and for obtaining Katello certificate
updates
|443 |TCP |HTTPS |Anaconda, yum, Telemetry Services, and Puppet
|5647 |TCP |amqp |Katello agent to communicate with {SmartProxy}'s
Qpid dispatch router
|8000 |TCP |HTTPS |Anaconda to download kickstart templates to hosts,
and for downloading iPXE firmware
|8140 |TCP |HTTPS |Puppet agent to Puppet master connections
|8443 |TCP |HTTPS |Subscription Management Services and Telemetry Services
|9090 |TCP |HTTPS |Sending SCAP reports to the Smart Proxy in the
{SmartProxy} and for the discovery image during provisioning
| 53 | TCP and UDP | DNS | Client DNS queries to a {SmartProxy}'s DNS service (Optional)
| 67 | UDP | DHCP | Client to {SmartProxy} broadcasts, DHCP broadcasts for Client provisioning from a {SmartProxy} (Optional)
| 69 | UDP |TFTP | Clients downloading PXE boot image files from a {SmartProxy} for provisioning (Optional)
| 5000   | TCP   | HTTPS | Connection to Katello for the Docker registry (Optional)
|====

.Ports for {SmartProxy} to Client Communication
[cols="24%,20%,18%,38%a",options="header"]
|====
| Port | Protocol | Service | Required For
| 7 | TCP and UDP | ICMP | DHCP {SmartProxy} to Client network, ICMP ECHO to verify IP address is free (Optional)
| 68 | UDP | DHCP | {SmartProxy} to Client broadcasts, DHCP broadcasts for Client provisioning from a {SmartProxy} (Optional)
| 8443 | TCP |HTTP | {SmartProxy} to Client "reboot" command to a discovered host during provisioning (Optional)
|====

Any managed host that is directly connected to {ProjectServer} is a client in this context because it is a client of the integrated {SmartProxy}. This includes the base system on which a {SmartProxyServer} is running.


.Optional Network Ports
[cols="24%,20%,18%,38%a",options="header"]
|====
| Port | Protocol | Service | Required For
| 22 | TCP | SSH | {Project} and {SmartProxy} originated communications, for Remote Execution (Rex) and Ansible.
| 7911 | TCP | DHCP | * {SmartProxy} originated commands for orchestration of DHCP records (local or external).
                      * If DHCP is provided by an external service, you must open the port on the external server.
|====

NOTE: A DHCP {SmartProxy} sends an ICMP ECHO to confirm an IP address is free, *no response* of any kind is expected. ICMP can be dropped by a networked-based firewall, but *any* response prevents the allocation of IP addresses.

= Ports and Firewalls Requirements

For the components of {Project} architecture to communicate, ensure that the required network ports are open and free on the base operating system.
You must also ensure that the required network ports are open on any network-based firewalls.

The installation of a {SmartProxyServer} fails if the ports between {ProjectServer} and {SmartProxyServer} are not open before installation starts.

Use this information to configure any network-based firewalls.
Note that some cloud solutions must be specifically configured to allow communications between machines because they isolate machines similarly to network-based firewalls.
If you use an application-based firewall, ensure that the application-based firewall permits all applications that are listed in the tables and known to your firewall.
If possible, disable the application checking and allow open port communication based on the protocol.

.Integrated {SmartProxy}
{ProjectServer} has an integrated {SmartProxy} and any host that is directly connected to {ProjectServer} is a Client of {Project} in the context of this section.
This includes the base operating system on which {SmartProxyServer} is running.

.Clients of {SmartProxy}
Hosts which are clients of {SmartProxies}, other than {Project}'s integrated {SmartProxy}, do not need access to {ProjectServer}.
For more information on {Project} Topology, see {PlanningDocURL}sect-Documentation-Architecture_Guide-Capsule_Networking[{SmartProxy} Networking] in _{PlanningDocTitle}_.

Required ports can change based on your configuration.

The following tables indicate the destination port and the direction of network traffic:

|====

Any managed host that is directly connected to {ProjectServer} is a client in this context because it is a client of the integrated {SmartProxy}.
This includes the base operating system on which a {SmartProxyServer} is running.

A DHCP {SmartProxy} performs ICMP ping and TCP echo connection attempts to hosts in subnets with DHCP IPAM set to find out if an IP address considered for use is free.
This behavior can be turned off using `{foreman-installer} --foreman-proxy-dhcp-ping-free-ip=false`.

|====

NOTE: ICMP to Port 7 UDP and TCP must not be rejected, but can be dropped.
The DHCP {SmartProxy} sends an ECHO REQUEST to the Client network to verify that an IP address is free.
Any response will prevent IP addresses being allocated.

[id="capsule-ports-and-firewalls-requirements_{context}"]

The following tables indicate the destination port and the direction of network traffic:

.Ports for Capsule to Satellite Communication
[cols="24%,20%,18%,38%",options="header"]
|====
| Port | Protocol | Service | Required For
| 5646   | TCP   |  amqp   |  Capsule's Qpid dispatch router to Qpid dispatch router in Satellite
|====

.Ports for Client to Capsule Communication
[cols="24%,20%,18%,38%",options="header"]
|====
|Port |Protocol |Service |Required for
|80 |TCP |HTTP |Anaconda, yum, and for obtaining Katello certificate
updates
|443 |TCP |HTTPS |Anaconda, yum, Telemetry Services, and Puppet
|5647 |TCP |amqp |Katello agent to communicate with Capsule's
Qpid dispatch router
|8000 |TCP |HTTPS |Anaconda to download kickstart templates to hosts,
and for downloading iPXE firmware
|8140 |TCP |HTTPS |Puppet agent to Puppet master connections
|8443 |TCP |HTTPS |Subscription Management Services and Telemetry Services
|9090 |TCP |HTTPS |Sending SCAP reports to the Smart Proxy in the
Capsule and for the discovery image during provisioning
| 53 | TCP and UDP | DNS | Client DNS queries to a Capsule's DNS service (Optional)
| 67 | UDP | DHCP | Client to Capsule broadcasts, DHCP broadcasts for Client provisioning from a Capsule (Optional)
| 69 | UDP |TFTP | Clients downloading PXE boot image files from a Capsule for provisioning (Optional)
| 5000   | TCP   | HTTPS | Connection to Katello for the Docker registry (Optional)
|====

.Ports for Capsule to Client Communication
[cols="24%,20%,18%,38%a",options="header"]
|====
| Port | Protocol | Service | Required For
| 7 | TCP and UDP | ICMP | DHCP Capsule to Client network, ICMP ECHO to verify IP address is free (Optional)
| 68 | UDP | DHCP | Capsule to Client broadcasts, DHCP broadcasts for Client provisioning from a Capsule (Optional)
| 8443 | TCP |HTTP | Capsule to Client "reboot" command to a discovered host during provisioning (Optional)
|====

Any managed host that is directly connected to Satellite Server is a client in this context because it is a client of the integrated Capsule. This includes the base system on which a Capsule Server is running.


.Optional Network Ports
[cols="24%,20%,18%,38%a",options="header"]
|====
| Port | Protocol | Service | Required For
| 22 | TCP | SSH | Satellite and Capsule originated communications, for Remote Execution (Rex) and Ansible.
| 7911 | TCP | DHCP | * Capsule originated commands for orchestration of DHCP records (local or external).
                      * If DHCP is provided by an external service, you must open the port on the external server.
|====

NOTE: A DHCP Capsule sends an ICMP ECHO to confirm an IP address is free, *no response* of any kind is expected. ICMP can be dropped by a networked-based firewall, but *any* response prevents the allocation of IP addresses.

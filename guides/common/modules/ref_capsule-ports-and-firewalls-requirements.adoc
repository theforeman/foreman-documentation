= Ports and Firewalls Requirements

For the components of {Project} architecture to communicate, ensure that the required network ports are open and free on the base operating system.
You must also ensure that the required network ports are open on any network-based firewalls.

The installation of a {SmartProxyServer} fails if the ports between {ProjectServer} and {SmartProxyServer} are not open before installation starts.

Use this information to configure any network-based firewalls.
Note that some cloud solutions must be specifically configured to allow communications between machines because they isolate machines similarly to network-based firewalls.
If you use an application-based firewall, ensure that the application-based firewall permits all applications that are listed in the tables and known to your firewall.
If possible, disable the application checking and allow open port communication based on the protocol.

.Integrated {SmartProxy}
{ProjectServer} has an integrated {SmartProxy} and any host that is directly connected to {ProjectServer} is a Client of {Project} in the context of this section.
This includes the base operating system on which {SmartProxyServer} is running.

.Clients of {SmartProxy}
Hosts which are clients of {SmartProxies}, other than {Project}'s integrated {SmartProxy}, do not need access to {ProjectServer}.
For more information on {Project} Topology, see {PlanningDocURL}sect-Documentation-Architecture_Guide-Capsule_Networking[{SmartProxy} Networking] in _Planning for {ProjectNameX}_.

Required ports can change based on your configuration.

ifeval::["{build}" != "foreman-deb"]
A matrix table of ports is available in the Red{nbsp}Hat Knowledgebase solution https://access.redhat.com/solutions/5627751[Red Hat Satellite List of Network Ports].

The following tables indicate the destination port and the direction of network traffic:

.Ports for {SmartProxy} to {Project} Communication
[cols="24%,20%,18%,38%",options="header"]
|====
| Port | Protocol | Service | Required For
| 5646   | TCP   |  amqp   |  {SmartProxy}'s Qpid dispatch router to Qpid dispatch router in {Project}
|====

ifeval::["{build}" == "foreman-el"]
Some of the following ports apply only to deployments that use the Katello plug-in.
endif::[]

ifeval::["{build}" == "foreman-deb"]
Some of the following ports apply only to deployments that use the Katello plug-in.
For Debian deployments, ignore references to the Katello plug-in.

.Ports for Client to {SmartProxy} Communication
[cols="24%,20%,18%,38%",options="header"]

ifeval::["{build}" == "satellite"]
|Port |Protocol |Service |Required for
|80 |TCP |HTTP |Anaconda, yum, and for obtaining Katello certificate
updates
|443 |TCP |HTTPS |Anaconda, yum, Telemetry Services, and Puppet
| 5646 | TCP | AMQP | The {SmartProxy} Qpid dispatch router to the Qpid dispatch router in {Project}
|5647 |TCP |AMQP |Katello agent to communicate with {SmartProxy}'s
Qpid dispatch router
|8000 |TCP |HTTPS |Anaconda to download kickstart templates to hosts,
and for downloading iPXE firmware
endif::[]
ifeval::["{build}" == "foreman-el"]
|Port |Protocol |Service |Required for

updates
|443 |TCP |HTTPS |Operating System installers like Anaconda, yum, Telemetry Services, and Puppet
|5646 | TCP | AMQP | The {SmartProxy} Qpid dispatch router to the Qpid dispatch router in {Project}
|5647 |TCP |amqp |For Katello plug-in users: Katello agent to communicate with {SmartProxy}'s
Qpid dispatch router

endif::[]
|8140 |TCP |HTTPS |Puppet agent to Puppet master connections
|8443 |TCP |HTTPS |Subscription Management Services and Telemetry Services
|9090 |TCP |HTTPS |Sending SCAP reports to the {SmartProxy} and for the discovery image during provisioning
| 53 | TCP and UDP | DNS | Client DNS queries to a {SmartProxy}'s DNS service (Optional)
| 67 | UDP | DHCP | Client to {SmartProxy} broadcasts, DHCP broadcasts for Client provisioning from a {SmartProxy} (Optional)

.Ports for {SmartProxy} to Client Communication
[cols="24%,20%,18%,38%a",options="header"]
|====
| Port | Protocol | Service | Required For
| 7 | TCP and UDP | ICMP | DHCP {SmartProxy} to Client network, ICMP ECHO to verify IP address is free (Optional)
| 68 | UDP | DHCP | {SmartProxy} to Client broadcasts, DHCP broadcasts for Client provisioning from a {SmartProxy} (Optional)
| 8443 | TCP |HTTP | {SmartProxy} to Client "reboot" command to a discovered host during provisioning (Optional)
|====

Any managed host that is directly connected to {ProjectServer} is a client in this context because it is a client of the integrated {SmartProxy}.
This includes the base operating system on which a {SmartProxyServer} is running.


.Optional Network Ports
[cols="24%,20%,18%,38%a",options="header"]
|====
| Port | Protocol | Service | Required For
| 22 | TCP | SSH | {Project} and {SmartProxy} originated communications, for Remote Execution (Rex) and Ansible.
| 7911 | TCP | DHCP | * {SmartProxy} originated commands for orchestration of DHCP records (local or external).
                      * If DHCP is provided by an external service, you must open the port on the external server.
|====

NOTE: A DHCP {SmartProxy} sends an ICMP ECHO to confirm an IP address is free, *no response* of any kind is expected.
ICMP can be dropped by a networked-based firewall, but *any* response prevents the allocation of IP addresses.

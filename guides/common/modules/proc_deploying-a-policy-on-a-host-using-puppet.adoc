[id="Deploying_a_Policy_on_a_Host_Using_Puppet_{context}"]
= Deploying a policy on a host using Puppet

[role="_abstract"]
After you deploy a compliance policy on a host using Puppet, the Puppet agent installs the SCAP client and configures OpenSCAP scans on the host on the next Puppet run according to the selected compliance policy.

The SCAP content in your compliance policy might require remote resources.
For more information, see xref:inclusion-of-remote-scap-resources_{context}[].

.Prerequisites
* You have enabled OpenSCAP on your {SmartProxy}.
For more information, see xref:enabling-openscap[].
ifdef::foreman-el,foreman-deb[]
* Ensure that a repository that provides the `openscap-scanner` package and its dependencies is enabled on the host.
endif::[]
ifndef::foreman-el,foreman-deb[]
* Repositories for the operating system version of the host are synchronized on {ProjectServer} and enabled on the host.

For example, for {EL} you might require:
endif::[]
** {EL} 10 BaseOS and AppStream RPMs repositories
** {EL} 9 BaseOS and AppStream RPMs repositories
** {EL} 8 BaseOS and AppStream RPMs repositories
** {EL} 7 Server and Extras RPMs repositories

You might require:
** For Ubuntu 24.04 "Noble": Suite `noble` and components `main universe`
** For Debian 12 "Bookworm": Suite `bookworm` and component `main`

ifdef::foreman-el[]
* {project-client-name} repository is available on the host.
endif::[]
ifndef::foreman-el[]
* {project-client-name} repository for the operating system version of the host is synchronized on {ProjectServer}, available in the content view and the lifecycle environment of the host, and enabled for the host.

This repository is required for installing the SCAP client.
* You have xref:Creating_a_Compliance_Policy_{context}[created a compliance policy] with the Puppet deployment option.

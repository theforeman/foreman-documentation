= Importing Content

This chapter outlines how you can import different types of {customcontent} to {Project}.
ifndef::orcharhino[]
If you want to import RPMs, Files, or different content types to {Project}, it is done with largely the same procedures in this chapter.

ifdef::orcharhino[]
If you want to import RPM or DEB packages, Files, or Puppet Modules to {Project}, it is done with largely the same procedures in this chapter.
endif::[]

NOTE: If you have a disconnected environment and some of your {ProjectServer}s are on versions older than 6.10 while others are on 6.10, content import and content export do not work.
All {ProjectServer}s should be on the same version.

For example, you can use the following chapters for information on specific types of {customcontent} but the underlying procedures are the same:

* xref:Managing_ISO_Images_{context}[]
* xref:Managing_Custom_File_Type_Content_{context}[]

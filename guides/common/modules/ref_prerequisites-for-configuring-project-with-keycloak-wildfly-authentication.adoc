= Prerequisites for configuring {Project} with {keycloak-wildfly} authentication

[role="_abstract"]
Your {ProjectServer} and {keycloak} server must meet the following requirements before you configure {keycloak-wildfly} authentication.

On your {ProjectServer}:

* Install the packages required for registering a {keycloak} client:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
# {project-package-install} mod_auth_openidc keycloak-httpd-client-install python3-lxml
----
// python3-lxml is only needed on EL9 because of https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-31496

On the {keycloak} side, ensure you meet the following requirements:

* Your {keycloak} server uses HTTPS instead of HTTP.
* If the certificates or the CA are self-signed, they have been added to the end-user certificate truststore.
* Your {keycloak} account has administrative privileges.
* A realm is created on the {keycloak} server for {Project} user accounts, for example `_{Project}_Realm_`.
* User accounts have been imported or added to {keycloak}.

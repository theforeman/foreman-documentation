= Configuring {Project} to manage the lifecycle of a host registered to a {FreeIPA} realm

[role="_abstract"]
As well as providing access to {ProjectServer}, hosts provisioned with {Project} can also be integrated with {FreeIPA} realms.
{ProjectName} has a realm feature that automatically manages the lifecycle of any system registered to a realm or domain provider.

Use this section to configure {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer} for {FreeIPA} realm support, then add hosts to the {FreeIPA} realm group.

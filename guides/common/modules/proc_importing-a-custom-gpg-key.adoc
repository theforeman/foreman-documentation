= Importing a {customgpgtitle} Key

When clients are consuming signed {customcontent}, ensure that the clients are configured to validate the installation of packages with the appropriate GPG Key.
This helps to ensure that only packages from authorized sources can be installed.

ifdef::satellite[]
Red Hat content is already configured with the appropriate GPG key and thus GPG Key management of Red Hat Repositories is not supported.
endif::[]

To use the CLI instead of the {ProjectWebUI}, see the xref:cli-importing-a-gpg-key[].

.Prerequisites
Ensure that you have a copy of the GPG key used to sign the RPM content that you want to use and manage in {Project}.
Most RPM distribution providers provide their GPG Key on their website.
You can also extract this manually from an RPM:

. Download a copy of the version specific repository package to your client system:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
$ wget _http://www.example.com/9.5/example-9.5-2.noarch.rpm_
----
. Extract the RPM file without installing it:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
$ rpm2cpio _example-9.5-2.noarch.rpm_ | cpio -idmv
----

The GPG key is located relative to the extraction at `etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-_EXAMPLE-95_`.
endif::[]

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Content* > *Content Credentials* and in the upper-right of the window, click *Create Content Credential*.
. Enter the name of your repository and select *GPG Key* from the *Type* list.
. Either paste the GPG key into the *Content Credential Contents* field, or click *Browse* and select the GPG key file that you want to import.
+
If your {customrepo} contains content signed by multiple GPG keys, you must enter all required GPG keys in the *Content Credential Contents* field with new lines between each key, for example:

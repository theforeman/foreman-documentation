= Remediating compliance failures

With {Project}, you can examine compliance reports and, in some cases, remediate cases of non-compliance.
You can remediate compliance failures by using a remediation wizard or by applying remediation snippets manually.

[WARNING]
====
Always test the recommended remedial actions or scripts in a non-production environment before implementing them in production.
Remediation might render the system non-functional.

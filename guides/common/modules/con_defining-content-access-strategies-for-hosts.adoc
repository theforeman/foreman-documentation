= Defining content access strategies for hosts

When defining your content lifecycle in {Project}, you can use content views and lifecycle environments to define which hosts can access which content and content versions.
By default, {Project} includes the _Default Organization View_ content view and the _Library_ lifecycle environment.

Default Organization View::
The _Default Organization View_ is the default content view in {Project} that contains all the content that is synchronized to {Project}.
After you update your content, such as by adding or removing a repository, the update is immediately reflected in _Default Organization View_.

Library::
The _Library_ lifecycle environment is the default lifecycle environment in {Project}.
Every newly published content view version is automatically published to the Library lifecycle environment.
You can also promote specific content view versions to the Library lifecycle environment if needed.

In smaller deployments or when you do not require content versioning and environment promotion, you can associate a host to the _Library_ environment under the _Default Organization View_ without configuring additional lifecycle environments.

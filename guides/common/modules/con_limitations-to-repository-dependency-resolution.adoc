= Limitations to Repository Dependency Resolution

With {Project}, using incremental updates to your Content Views solves some repository dependency problems.
However, dependency resolution at a repository level still remains problematic on occasion.

When a repository update becomes available with a new dependency, {Project} retrieves the newest version of the package to solve the dependency, even if there are older versions available in the existing repository package.
This can create further dependency resolution problems when installing packages.

.Example scenario

A repository on your client has the package `example_repository-1.0` with the dependency `example_repository-libs-1.0`.
The repository also has another package `example_tools-1.0`.

A security erratum becomes available with the package `example_tools-1.1`.
The `example_tools-1.1` package requires the `example_repository-libs-1.1` package as a dependency.

After an incremental Content View update, the `example_tools-1.1`, `example_tools-1.0`, and `example_repository-libs-1.1` are now in the repository.
The repository also has the packages `example_repository-1.0` and `example_repository-libs-1.0`.
Note that the incremental update to the Content View did not add the package `example_repository-1.1`.
Because you can install all these packages using yum, no potential problem is detected.
However, when the client installs the `example_tools-1.1` package, a dependency resolution problem occurs because both `example_repository-libs-1.0` and `example_repository-libs-1.1` cannot be installed.

There is currently no workaround for this problem.
The larger the time frame, and minor _Y_ releases between the base set of packages and the errata being applied, the higher the chance of a problem with dependency resolution.

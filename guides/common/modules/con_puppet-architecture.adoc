= Puppet Architecture

Puppet uses a server-client architecture with managed hosts running the Puppet agent and {Project} or any {SmartProxies} acting as a Puppet server.
The Puppet agent enforces the declared state on managed hosts.
It sends facts to the Puppet server, receives catalogs that are compiled from Puppet manifests, and sends reports to your {Project}.
Differences between the declared state and the actual state are called _drifts_ in Puppet terminology.

Puppet facts are information about the hosts running the Puppet agent.
Running `puppet facts` on a host displays Puppet facts in JSON format.
They are collected by the Puppet agent and reported to the Puppet server on each run.

{Project} users can define Puppet parameters as _key-value_ pairs which behave similar to host parameters or Ansible variables.

This section is set out to use a Puppet module to install, configure, and manage the _ntp_ service.

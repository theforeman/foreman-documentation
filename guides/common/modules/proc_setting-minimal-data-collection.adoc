= Setting minimal data collection 

You can configure {Project} to use minimal reporting if you want to limit the data sent to Red{nbsp}Hat.
You can use minimal reporting to limit the amount of system data sent to the Subscriptions service, which remains active.
Other Insights services are disabled because they require installed package data, which minimal reports do not include.
Reports are still processed daily during the midnight synchronization cycle.

Minimal reports also exclude hostnames, IP addresses, and installed packages.
Therefore, obfuscation and exclusion settings do not apply.

If you switch to *Optional data collection*, {Project} enables the following settings by default:

* Obfuscate host names
* Obfuscate host ipv4 addresses
* Exclude installed packages

Review and adjust these settings to control what data {Project} shares.

.Prerequisites
* Your user account has a role that grants the `edit_settings` permission.
* Ensure that you delete existing data in Insights Inventory before switching to minimal reporting.
To remove existing data of a system, navigate to *Inventory* > *Systems* in the {RHCloud}, select the system, and click *Delete*.
* You have selected an organization and location.       

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Insights* > *Inventory Upload*.
. Select the *Minimal data collection* setting from the dropdown menu under *Settings*.
When you select this option, {Project} also updates the corresponding setting on the *Insights* tab under *Administer* > *Settings*. 
. Click the *Generate and upload report* button to create a new inventory report and send it to the {RHCloud}.

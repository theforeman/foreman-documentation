= Setting minimal data collection 

You can configure {Project} to use minimal reporting if you want to limit the data sent to the Subscriptions service and disable Insights integration.
This option allows you to limit the amount of system data sent to Red{nbsp}Hat while still supporting the Subscriptions service.
When you configure a host to use *Minimal data collection*, only the Subscriptions service remains active, with reports processed daily during the midnight synchronization cycle. 
Other Insights services are disabled because they require installed package data, which minimal reports do not include.

Switching from *Minimal data collection* to *Optional data collection* enables all available settings. 
Review and adjust these settings as needed if you do not want to share certain types of host data.

.Prerequisites
* Your user account has a role that grants the `edit_settings` permission.
* Ensure that you delete existing data in Insights Inventory before switching to minimal reporting.
To remove existing data of a system, navigate to *Inventory* > *Systems* in the {RHCloud}, select the system, and click *Delete*.
* You have selected an organization and location.       

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Insights* > *Inventory Upload*.
. Select the *Minimal data collection* setting from the dropdown menu under *Settings*.
When you select this option, {Project} also updates the corresponding setting on the *Insights* tab under *Administer* > *Settings*. 
When you select *Minimal data collection*, {Project} does not include hostnames or IP addresses in the report, so the settings to obfuscate this information do not apply. 
{Project} also ignores the setting to exclude installed packages, as it always excludes them from reports at this level.

. Click the *Generate and upload report* button to create a new inventory report using the *Minimal data collection* setting and send it to the {RHCloud}.

[WARNING]
====
If *Automatic mismatch deletion* is enabled, {Project} removes any hosts from the {RHCloud} that are not registered in {Project}. 
Enable this setting only when all hosts are registered through {Project}. 
If any hosts are registered through other {Project} instances or directly to the {RHCloud}, {Project} deletes them.

= Discovering hosts on a network

[role="_abstract"]
{ProjectName} can detect hosts on a network that are not in your {Project} inventory.
These hosts boot the Discovery image that performs hardware detection and relays this information back to {ProjectServer}.
This method creates a list of ready-to-provision hosts in {ProjectServer} without needing to enter the MAC address of each host.

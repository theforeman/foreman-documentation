= Increasing Host Limit for Pull-Based REX Transport

You can tune the `mosquitto` MQTT server and increase the number of hosts connected to it.

.Procedure
. Enable pull-based remote execution on your {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer}:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-installer} --foreman-proxy-plugin-remote-execution-script-mode pull-mqtt
----
+
Note that your {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer} can only use one transport mode, either SSH or MQTT.
. Create a config file to increase the default number of hosts accepted by the MQTT service:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
cat >/etc/systemd/system/mosquitto.service.d/limits.conf <<__EOF__
[Service]
LimitNOFILE=5000
__EOF__
----
+
This example sets the limit to allow the `mosquitto` service to handle 5000 hosts.
. Run the following commands to apply your changes:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# systemctl daemon-reload
# systemctl restart mosquitto.service

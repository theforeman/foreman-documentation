[id="verifying-dns-resolution"]
= Verifying DNS resolution

Verify the full forward and reverse DNS resolution using a fully-qualified domain name to prevent issues while installing {Project}.

.Procedure
. Ensure that the host name and local host resolve correctly:
+
[options="nowrap"]
----
# ping -c 1 localhost
# ping -c 1 `hostname -f`
----
+
Successful name resolution results in output similar to the following:
+
[source, none, options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# ping -c 1 localhost
PING localhost (127.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from localhost (127.0.0.1): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.043 ms

--- localhost ping statistics ---
1 packets transmitted, 1 received, 0% packet loss, time 0ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.043/0.043/0.043/0.000 ms

# ping -c 1 `hostname -f`
PING {foreman-example-com} (XX.XX.XX.XX) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from {foreman-example-com} (XX.XX.XX.XX): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.019 ms

--- {foreman-example-com} ping statistics ---
1 packets transmitted, 1 received, 0% packet loss, time 0ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.019/0.019/0.019/0.000 ms

----
. Set the host name of your system to avoid discrepancies with static and transient host names:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hostnamectl set-hostname _My_Host_Name_

[WARNING]
====
Name resolution is critical to the operation of {Project}.
ifdef::foreman-deb[]
If {Project} cannot properly resolve its fully qualified domain name, many options fail, such as provisioning.

ifndef::foreman-deb[]
If {Project} cannot properly resolve its fully qualified domain name, tasks such as content management, subscription management, and provisioning will fail.

= Verifying DNS resolution

Verify the full forward and reverse DNS resolution using a fully-qualified domain name to prevent issues while installing {Project}.

.Procedure

. Ensure that the host name and local host resolve correctly:
+
[options="nowrap"]
----
# ping -c1 localhost
# ping -c1 `hostname -f` # my_system.domain.com
----
+
Successful name resolution results in output similar to the following:
+
[options="nowrap"]
----
# ping -c1 localhost
PING localhost (127.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from localhost (127.0.0.1): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.043 ms

--- localhost ping statistics ---
1 packets transmitted, 1 received, 0% packet loss, time 0ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.043/0.043/0.043/0.000 ms

# ping -c1 `hostname -f`
PING hostname.gateway (XX.XX.XX.XX) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from hostname.gateway (XX.XX.XX.XX): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.019 ms

--- localhost.gateway ping statistics ---
1 packets transmitted, 1 received, 0% packet loss, time 0ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.019/0.019/0.019/0.000 ms

----

. To avoid discrepancies with static and transient host names, set all the host names on the system by entering the following command:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hostnamectl set-hostname _name_

Name resolution is critical to the operation of {ProjectX}. If {Project} cannot properly resolve its fully qualified domain name, tasks such as content management, subscription management, and provisioning will fail.

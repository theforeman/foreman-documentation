= Adding Permissions to a Role

Use this procedure to add permissions to a role.
To use the CLI instead of the {ProjectWebUI}, see the xref:cli-adding-permissions-to-a-role_{context}[].

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Administer* > *Roles*.
. Select *Add Filter* from the drop-down list to the right of the required role.
. Select the *Resource type* from the drop-down list.
The _(Miscellaneous)_ group gathers permissions that are not associated with any resource group.
. Click the permissions you want to select from the *Permission* list.
. Depending on the *Resource type* selected, you can select or deselect the *Unlimited* and *Override* checkbox.
The *Unlimited* checkbox is selected by default, which means that the permission is applied on all resources of the selected type.
When you disable the *Unlimited* checkbox, the *Search* field activates.
In this field you can specify further filtering with use of the {Project} search syntax.
For more information, see xref:Granular_Permission_Filtering_{context}[].
When you enable the *Override* checkbox, you can add additional locations and organizations to allow the role to access the resource type in the additional locations and organizations; you can also remove an already associated location and organization from the resource type to restrict access.
. Click *Next*.
. Click *Submit* to save changes.

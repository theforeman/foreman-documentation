[id="Configuring_Installation_{context}"]
= Configuring {Project} Installation

This initial configuration procedure creates an organization, location, user name, and password.
After the initial configuration, you can create additional organizations and locations if required.
The initial configuration also installs PostgreSQL databases on the same server.

The installation process can take tens of minutes to complete.
If you are connecting remotely to the system, use a utility such as `tmux` that allows suspending and reattaching a communication session so that you can check the installation progress in case you become disconnected from the remote system.
If you lose connection to the shell where the installation command is running, see the log at `{installer-log-file}` to determine if the process completed successfully.

.Considerations

* Use the `{installer-scenario} --help` command to display the available options and any default values.
If you do not specify any values, the default values are used.

* Specify a meaningful value for the option: `--foreman-initial-organization`.
This can be your company name.
An internal label that matches the value is also created and cannot be changed afterwards.
If you do not specify a value, an organization called *Default Organization* with the label *Default_Organization* is created.
You can rename the organization name but not the label.

* Remote Execution is the primary method of managing packages on Content Hosts. If you want to use the deprecated Katello Agent instead of Remote Execution SSH, use the `--foreman-proxy-content-enable-katello-agent=true` option to enable it. The same option should be given on any {SmartProxyServer} as well as {ProjectServer}.

* By default, all configuration files configured by the installer are managed by Puppet.
When `{foreman-installer}` runs, it overwrites any manual changes to the Puppet managed files with the initial values.
By default, {ProjectServer} is installed with the Puppet agent running as a service.
If required, you can disable Puppet agent on {ProjectServer} using the `--puppet-runmode=none` option.

* If you want to manage DNS files and DHCP files manually, use the `--foreman-proxy-dns-managed=false` and `--foreman-proxy-dhcp-managed=false` options so that Puppet does not manage the files related to the respective services.

.Procedure

. Enter the following command with any additional options that you want to use:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# {installer-scenario} \
--foreman-initial-organization "_My_Organization_" \
--foreman-initial-location "_My_Location_" \
--foreman-initial-admin-username _admin_user_name_ \
--foreman-initial-admin-password _admin_password_

The script displays its progress and writes logs to `{installer-log-file}`.

[id="Configuring_Installation_{context}"]
= Configuring {Project} Installation

This initial configuration procedure creates an organization, location, user name, and password.
After the initial configuration, you can create additional organizations and locations if required.
The initial configuration also installs PostgreSQL databases on the same server.

The installation process can take tens of minutes to complete.
If you are connecting remotely to the system, use a utility such as `tmux` that allows suspending and reattaching a communication session so that you can check the installation progress in case you become disconnected from the remote system.
If you lose connection to the shell where the installation command is running, see the log at `{installer-log-file}` to determine if the process completed successfully.

.Considerations

* Use the `{installer-scenario} --help` command to display the most commonly used options and any default values.
* Use the `{installer-scenario} --full-help` command to display advanced options.

* Specify a meaningful value for the option: `--foreman-initial-organization`.
This can be your company name.
An internal label that matches the value is also created and cannot be changed afterwards.
If you do not specify a value, an organization called *Default Organization* with the label *Default_Organization* is created.
You can rename the organization name but not the label.

* Remote Execution is the primary method of managing packages on Content Hosts. If you want to use the deprecated Katello Agent instead of Remote Execution SSH, use the `--foreman-proxy-content-enable-katello-agent=true` option to enable it. The same option should be given on any {SmartProxyServer} as well as {ProjectServer}.

* By default, all configuration files configured by the installer are managed.
When `{foreman-installer}` runs, it overwrites any manual changes to the managed files with the intended values.
This means that running the installer on a broken system should restore it to working order, regardless of changes made.
For more information on how to apply custom configuration on other services, see {InstallingServerDocURL}applying-custom-configuration_{project-context}[Applying Custom Configuration to {Project}].

* By default, {ProjectServer} is installed with the Puppet agent running as a service.
If required, you can disable Puppet agent on {ProjectServer} using the `--puppet-runmode=none` option.

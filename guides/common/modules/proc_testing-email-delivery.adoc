= Testing email delivery

To verify the delivery of emails, send a test email to a user.
If the email gets delivered, the settings are correct.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Administer* > *Users*.
. Click on the username.
. On the *Email Preferences* tab, click *Test email*.

A test email message is sent immediately to the user's email address.

If the email is delivered, the verification is complete.
Otherwise, you must perform the following diagnostic steps:

.. Verify the user's email address.
.. Verify {ProjectServer}'s email configuration.
.. Examine firewall and mail server logs.
.. If your {ProjectServer} uses the Postfix service for email delivery, the test email might be held in the queue.
To verify, enter the `mailq` command to list the current mail queue.
If the test email is held in the queue, `mailq` displays the following message:

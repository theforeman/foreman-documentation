= Configuring {SmartProxyServers} with custom SSL certificates for load balancing

You can configure one or more {SmartProxyServers} that use custom SSL certificates for load balancing.
To do this, configure and install certificates on each {SmartProxyServer} you want to use for load balancing.

If you use Puppet in your {Project} deployment, the configuration steps are different.
See xref:configuring-{smart-proxy-context}-servers-with-custom-ssl-certificates-for-load-balancing-with-puppet_{context}[].

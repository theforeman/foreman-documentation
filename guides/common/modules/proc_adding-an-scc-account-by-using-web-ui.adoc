= Adding an SCC account to {Project} by using {ProjectWebUI}

[role="_abstract"]
Add your SCC account to {Project}.

[WARNING]
====
The SCC Manager plugin does not support multiple SCC accounts within one organization.
Add an additional SCC account only if you want to switch to using another SCC account.

If you need to use additional SCC accounts, add them to other organizations.
====

Do not upload packages to a repository if you have set the *Upstream URL*.
. Under *Upload Package*, click *Browse...* and select the Deb package that you want to upload.
. Click *Upload*.

.Verification
* To view all Deb packages in this repository, click the number next to *Packages* under *Content Counts*.

.Next steps
* Add your Deb repository to a content view.
For more information, see xref:creating-a-content-view-by-using-web-ui[].
* If your Deb repository is unprotected, hosts can consume its content by using the *Published At* URL.
+
In the Default Organization View content view, the URL consists of your {SmartProxy} FQDN, `/pulp/content/`, your organization label, `/Library/custom/`, your product label, `/`, your repository label, and a trailing `/`, for example, `\https://foreman.example.com/pulp/content/Example/Library/custom/my-software/my-app/`.
Use `katello` as the distribution to set up the repository on your host.

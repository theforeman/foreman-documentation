[id="GSS_Proxy_{context}"]
= GSS-Proxy

The traditional process of Kerberos authentication in Apache requires the Apache process to have read access to the keytab file.
GSS-Proxy allows you to implement stricter privilege separation for the Apache server by removing access to the keytab file while preserving Kerberos authentication functionality.
When using AD as an external authentication source for {Project}, it is recommended to implement GSS-proxy, because the keys in the keytab file are the same as the host keys.

[NOTE]
====
The AD integration requires {ProjectServer} to be deployed on {EL} 7.1 or later.
====

Perform the following procedures on {EL} that acts as a base operating system for your {ProjectServer}.
For the examples in this section _EXAMPLE.ORG_ is the Kerberos realm for the AD domain.
By completing the procedures, users that belong to the EXAMPLE.ORG realm can log in to {ProjectServer}.

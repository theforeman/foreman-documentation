= Disable Transparent Huge Pages

Transparent Huge Pages is a memory management technique used by the Linux kernel to reduce the overhead of using the Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) by using larger sized memory pages.
Due to databases having Sparse Memory Access patterns instead of Contiguous Memory access patterns, database workloads often perform poorly when Transparent Huge Pages is enabled.
To improve PostgreSQL or Redis performance, disable Transparent Huge Pages.
In deployments where the databases are running on a separate server(s), there may be a small benefit to using Transparent Huge Pages on the {ProjectServer} only.

= Configuring Pulpcore API Workers

The pulpcore-api workers respond to incoming API requests.
Fewer API workers consume less memory and results in better performance.

For example, we have compared these two setups:

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|{Project} VM with 8 CPUs, 32 GiB RAM, 3 pulpcore-api_workers |{Project} VM with 8 CPUs, 32 GiB RAM, 10 pulpcore-api_workers
|===

Outcome looks similar in both cases, so the recommendation would be to lower the number of API workers because of the improvement in memory consumption.

.Procedure
. Update the pulpcore api_service_worker_count on your {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer} in the custom-hiera.yaml file.:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
pulpcore::api_service_worker_count: X
----
. Apply your changes:

= Deploying the CA certificate on a host by using Script REX

You can use remote execution (REX) with the Script provider to deploy the CA certificate.
Redeploy the CA certificate when you change it on {ProjectServer}.

.Prerequisites
* The host is registered to {Project}.
* Remote execution is enabled on the host.
* The CA certificate has been changed on {ProjectServer}.
For more information, see {AdministeringDocURL}planning-for-ca-certificate-renewal[Planning for CA certificate renewal] in _{AdministeringDocTitle}_.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Monitor* > *Jobs*.
. Click *Run Job*.
. From the *Job category* list, select `Commands`.
. From the *Job template* list, select `Download and run a script`.
. Click *Next*.
. Select hosts on which you want to execute the job.
. In the *url* field, enter the following URL:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
https://_{foreman-example-com}_/unattended/public/foreman_ca_refresh
----
+
Replace _{foreman-example-com}_ with the hostname of your {ProjectServer}.

You can use HTTP when the CA certificate is expired.
However, {Team} recommends preparing the certificate renewal in advance.

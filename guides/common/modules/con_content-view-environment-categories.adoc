[id="Content_view_environment_categories_{context}"]
= Content view enviornment categories

The content view environments available in your organization fall into the following categories:

. *Library environment*:
The system assigns the Library environment to represent the Library lifecycle environment and the *Default Organization View* content view.

. *Unpromoted content views*:
For each content view that you publish but do not promote to a lifecycle environment, the system creates a content view environment.
The system labels these environments using the format: `Library/<content_view_label>`.

. *Promoted content views*:
For each content view that you promote to a specific lifecycle environment, the system creates a corresponding content view environment.
The system labels these environments using the format: `<lifecycle_environment_label>/<content_view_label>`.

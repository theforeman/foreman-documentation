= Enabling Connections from a Client to Satellite Server

Capsules and Content Hosts that are clients of a Satellite Server's internal Capsule require access through Satellite's host-based firewall and any network-based firewalls.

Use this section to configure the host-based firewall on the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 system that Satellite is installed on, to enable incoming connections from Clients, and to make the configuration persistent across system reboots. For more information on the ports used, see xref:ports-and-firewalls-requirements_satellite[].

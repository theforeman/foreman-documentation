= PXE booting requirements

To provision machines using PXE booting, ensure that you meet the following requirements:

.Network requirements
* Optional: If the host and the DHCP server are separated by a router, configure the DHCP relay agent and point to the DHCP server.

.Client requirements
* Ensure that all the network-based firewalls are configured to allow clients on the subnet to access the {SmartProxy}.
For more information, see xref:{smart-proxy-context}-networking_{context}[].

* Ensure that your client has access to the DHCP and TFTP servers.

.{Project} requirements
* Ensure that both {ProjectServer} and {SmartProxy} have DNS configured and are able to resolve provisioned host names.
* Ensure that the UDP ports 67 and 68 are accessible by the client to enable the client to receive a DHCP offer with the boot options.
* Ensure that the UDP port 69 is accessible by the client so that the client can access the TFTP server on the {SmartProxy}.
* Ensure that the TCP port 80 is accessible by the client to allow the client to download files and Kickstart templates from the {SmartProxy}.
* Ensure that the host provisioning interface subnet has a DHCP {SmartProxy} set.
* Ensure that the host provisioning interface subnet has a TFTP {SmartProxy} set.
* Ensure that the host provisioning interface subnet has a Templates {SmartProxy} set.
* Ensure that DHCP with the correct subnet is enabled using the {Project} installer.
* Enable TFTP using the {Project} installer.

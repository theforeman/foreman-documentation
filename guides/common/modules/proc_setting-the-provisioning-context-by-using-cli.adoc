= Setting the provisioning context by using Hammer CLI

[role="_abstract"]
When you set a provisioning context, you define which organization and location to use for provisioning hosts.

.Procedure
* When using the CLI, include either `--organization` or `--organization-label` and `--location` or `--location-id` as an option.
For example:
+
[subs="+quotes"]
----
$ hammer host list --organization "_My_Organization_" --location "_My_Location_"
----
+
This command outputs hosts allocated to `My_Organization` and `My_Location`.

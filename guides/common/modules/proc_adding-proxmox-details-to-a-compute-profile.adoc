= Adding Proxmox Details to a Compute Profile

You can predefine certain hardware settings for virtual machines on Proxmox.
You achieve this through adding these hardware settings to a compute profile.

Note that this procedure assumes you are using KVM/qemu-based virtualization.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Infrastructure* > *Compute Profiles*.
. Select a compute profile.
. Select a Proxmox compute resource.
// FIXME: this procedure currently assumes you've selected KVM/qemu
. In the *Type* list, select the kind of virtualization solution hosts will run on when created using this compute profile.
In Proxmox, you may choose between _LXC_ (Linux containers) and _KVM/QEMU_ (kernel-based virtual machines).
LXC focuses more on isolating applications and reusing the host kernel.
KVM runs its own kernel and lets you boot various guest operating systems.
. In the *Node* list, select the Proxmox node you want to deploy your hosts to.
This makes sense if you run a Proxmox cluster.
. If you want to automatically start virtual machines after creation, select the *Start after creation?* checkbox.
You can overwrite this for individual hosts when you create them.
. In the *Image* list, select an image that is available on your Proxmox compute resource.
. In the *Pool* list, select a resource allocation pool.
// FIXME: this procedure currently ignores advanced options "Main options", "CPU", "memory", and "OS"
. Optional: You can select the *Main options*, *CPU*, *Memory*, and *OS* checkboxes to configure the compute profile in more detail.
. In the *Identifier* field, enter the name of the network interface of your managed host.
The default value is `net0`.
. From the *Card* list, select the type of network interface card of your managed host.
. Optional: From the *Bridge* list, select a bridge to assign the host to it.
. Optional: In the *VLAN tag* field, you can assign your host to a VLAN.
The *VLAN tag* field lets you input the corresponding VLAN tag which your Proxmox machine is part of.
. Optional: In the *Rate limit* field, you can limit the network traffic of hosts.
. Optional: In the *Multiqueue* field, you can set multiple virtual CPUs to process network packets.
. Optional: If you want to use the integrated firewall in Proxmox, select the *Firewall* checkbox.
. Optional: If you want to disconnect your managed host from the network, select the *Disconnect* checkbox.
. Optional: Click *Add Interface* to add another network interface.
// FIXME: this procedure currently ignores "Add Hard Disk", "Add CD-ROM", and "Add Cloud-init"
. From the *Storage* list, select the name of the storage pool within Proxmox.
. In the *Controller* field, select the type of the disk controller of your managed host in Proxmox.
{Team} recommends to use either _SCSI_ or _VirtIO Block_.
. In the *Device* field, enter the number of the disk.
. In the *Cache* list, select the type of disk cache you want to use on your managed host in Proxmox.
{Team} does not recommend using caching within Proxmox.
. In the *Size (GB)* field, enter the size of the disk.
. Click *Submit* to save the compute profile.

= Adding Proxmox details to a compute profile

You can predefine certain hardware settings for virtual machines on Proxmox.
You achieve this through adding these hardware settings to a compute profile.

Note that this procedure assumes you are using KVM/qemu-based virtualization.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Infrastructure* > *Compute Profiles*.
. Select a compute profile.
. Select a Proxmox compute resource.
// FIXME: this procedure currently assumes you've selected KVM/Qemu
. From the *Type* list, select a virtualization option:
* *LXC container*: Linux containers that focus on isolating applications and reusing the host kernel
* *KVM/Qemu server*: Kernel-based virtual machines that run their own kernel and let you boot various guest operating systems
. Click the *General* tab.
. From the *Node* list, select a Proxmox node.
. From the *Image* list, select an image that is available on your Proxmox compute resource.
. From the *Pool* list, select a resource allocation pool.
. Optional: Click *Advanced Options*, *Hardware*, *Network Interfaces*, or *Storage* to configure compute profile settings.
. On the *Storage* tab, {Team} recommends to use either `SCSI` or `VirtIO Block` in the *Controller* field as the type of the disk controller of your host in Proxmox.
. On the *Storage* tab, {Team} does not recommend caching.
. Click *Submit* to save the compute profile.

{keycloak} is an open-source identity and access management solution that provides authentication features, such as single sign-on functionality, user federation, or centralized authentication management.
With {keycloak-wildfly}, you can integrate {ProjectServer} with your existing {keycloak} server to delegate user authentication and authorization to {keycloak}.
The following login methods are available:

* User name and password in {ProjectWebUI} and Hammer CLI
* Time-based one-time password (TOTP)

= Using Ansible provider for package and errata actions

[role="_abstract"]
By default, {Project} is configured to use the Script provider templates for remote execution jobs.
If you prefer using Ansible job templates for your remote jobs, you can configure {Project} to use them by default for remote execution features associated with them.

[NOTE]
====
Remember that Ansible job templates only work when remote execution is configured for `ssh` mode.
====

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Administer* > *Remote Execution Features*.
. Find each feature whose name contains `by_search`.
. Change the job template for these features from `Katello Script Default` to `Katello Ansible Default`.
. Click *Submit*.

{Project} now uses Ansible provider templates for remote execution jobs by which you can perform package and errata actions.
This applies to job invocations from the {ProjectWebUI} as well as by using `hammer job-invocation create` with the same remote execution features that you have changed.

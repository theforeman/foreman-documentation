Using the most recent version of a major browser is highly recommended, as {Project} and the frameworks it uses offer limited support for older versions.

The recommended requirements are as follows for major browsers:

* Google Chrome {endash} latest version
* Microsoft Edge {endash} latest version
* Apple Safari {endash} latest version
* Mozilla Firefox {endash} latest version
* Mozilla Firefox Extended Support Release (ESR) {endash} latest version

Other browsers may work unpredictably.

= Upgrading {EL} on {Project} or {SmartProxy}

{Project} and {SmartProxy} are supported on both {EL} 8 and {EL} 9.
You can use the following methods to upgrade your {Project} and {SmartProxy} operating system from {EL} 8 to {EL} 9:

* Leapp in-place upgrade
* Migration by using backup and restore
* Migration by using cloning

With Leapp, you can upgrade your {Project} or {SmartProxy} in place therefore it is faster but imposes a downtime on the services.
With migration, you can move your {Project} or {SmartProxy} to a fresh {EL} 9 system.
The {EL} 8 system remains operational during the migration, which reduces the downtime.

= Running an Ansible Playbook from {Project}

[role="_abstract"]
You can run an Ansible Playbook on a host or host group by executing a remote job in {Project}.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When you execute an Ansible Playbook on multiple hosts, {Project} renders the playbook for all hosts in the batch, but only uses the rendered playbook of the first host to execute it on all hosts in the batch.
Therefore, you cannot modify the behavior of the playbook per host by using a host parameter in the template control flow constructs.
Host parameters are translated into Ansible variables, so you can use them to control the behavior in native Ansible constructs.

.Prerequisites
* Ansible plugin in {Project} is enabled.
* Remote job execution is configured.
For more information, see xref:Configuring_and_Setting_Up_Remote_Jobs_{context}[].
* You have an Ansible Playbook ready to use.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Monitor* > *Jobs*.
. Click *Run Job*.
. In *Job category*, select `Ansible Playbook`.
. In *Job template*, select `Ansible - Run playbook`.
. Click *Next*.
. Select the hosts on which you want to run the playbook.
. In the *playbook* field, paste the content of your Ansible Playbook.
. Follow the wizard to complete setting the remote job.
For more information, see xref:Configuring_and_Setting_Up_Remote_Jobs_{context}[].
. Click *Submit* to run the Ansible Playbook on your hosts.

.Example Ansible Playbook to access host parameters
====
You can use host parameters from {Project} in Ansible Playbooks.

- name: "Ansible Playbook to access host parameters"
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: "View a host parameter"
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        msg: "{{ hostvars[inventory_hostname]['_My_Host_Parameter_'] }}"
...
----

Ansible will access the host parameter and show its value.
If you set the host parameter to an ERB template, for example, `<%= @host.capabilities.include?(:snapshots) %>`, {Project} will render it and provide the result to Ansible.
Ansible receives only the rendered value, not the ERB template itself.

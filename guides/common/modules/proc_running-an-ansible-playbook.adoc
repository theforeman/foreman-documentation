= Running an Ansible playbook from {Project}

You can run an Ansible playbook on a host or host group by executing a remote job in {Project}.

.Limitation of host parameters in Ansible playbook job templates
When you execute an Ansible playbook on multiple hosts, {Project} renders the playbook for all hosts in the batch, but only uses the rendered playbook of the first host to execute it on all hosts in the batch.
Therefore, you cannot modify the behavior of the playbook per host by using a host parameter in the template control flow constructs.
Host parameters are translated into Ansible variables, so you can use them to control the behavior in native Ansible constructs.

= Browsing hosts in {ProjectWebUI}

[role="_abstract"]
In the {ProjectWebUI}, you can browse all hosts recognized by {Project}, grouped by type.

The following host types are available when browsing hosts in the {ProjectWebUI}:

* *All Hosts* {endash} a list of all hosts recognized by {Project}.
* *Discovered Hosts* {endash} a list of bare-metal hosts detected on the provisioning network by the Discovery plugin.
ifdef::katello,orcharhino,satellite[]
* *Content Hosts* {endash} a list of hosts that manage tasks related to content and subscriptions.
* *Host Collections* {endash} a list of user-defined collections of hosts used for bulk actions such as errata installation.
endif::[]

To search for a host, type in the *Search* field, and use an asterisk ({asterisk}) to perform a partial string search.
For example, if searching for a content host named `{server-example-com}`, click the *Content Hosts* page and type `server*` in the *Search* field.
Alternatively, `{asterisk}ver{asterisk}` will also find the content host `{server-example-com}`.

[WARNING]
====
{ProjectServer} is listed as a host itself even if it is not self-registered.
Do not delete {ProjectServer} from the list of hosts.
====

When you are on a particular host in the {ProjectWebUI}, you can navigate between hosts without leaving the page by using the host switcher.
Click *â‡„* next to the hostname.
This displays a list of hosts in alphabetical order with a pagination arrow and a search bar to find the host you are looking for.

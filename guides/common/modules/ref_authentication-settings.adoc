|====
| Setting | Value | Description
| *OAuth active* | Yes | {Project} will use OAuth for API authorization
| *OAuth consumer key* | \\***** | OAuth consumer key
| *OAuth consumer secret* | \\***** | OAuth consumer secret
| *OAuth map users* | No | When enabled, {Project} maps users by username in request-header.
If this is disabled, OAuth requests have admin rights.
| *Failed login attempts limit* | 30 | {Project} blocks user logins from an IP address after this number of failed login attempts for 5 minutes.
Set to 0 to disable bruteforce protection
| *Restrict registered {SmartProxies}* | Yes | Only known {SmartProxies} can access features that use {SmartProxy} authentication
ifdef::satellite[]
| *Require SSL for capsules* | Yes | Client SSL certificates are used to identify {SmartProxies} (:require_ssl should also be enabled)
endif::[]
| *Trusted hosts* | [] | List of hostnames, IPv4, IPv6 addresses or subnets to be trusted in addition to {SmartProxies} for access to fact/report importers and ENC output
| *SSL certificate* | /etc/foreman/client_cert.pem | SSL Certificate path that {Project} uses to communicate with its proxies
| *SSL CA file* | /etc/foreman/proxy_ca.pem | SSL CA file path that {Project} uses to communicate with its proxies
| *SSL private key* | /etc/foreman/client_key.pem | SSL Private Key path that {Project} uses to communicate with its proxies
| *SSL client DN env* | HTTP_SSL_CLIENT_S_DN | Environment variable containing the subject DN from a client SSL certificate
| *SSL client verify env* | HTTP_SSL_CLIENT_VERIFY | Environment variable containing the verification status of a client SSL certificate
| *SSL client cert env* | HTTP_SSL_CLIENT_CERT | Environment variable containing a client's SSL certificate
| *Server CA file* | Empty | SSL CA file path used in templates to verify the connection to {Project}
| *Websockets SSL key* | etc/pki/katello/private/katello-apache.key | Private key file path that {Project} uses to encrypt websockets
| *Websockets SSL certificate* | /etc/pki/katello/certs/katello-apache.crt | Certificate path that {Project} uses to encrypt websockets
| *Websockets encryption* | Yes | VNC/SPICE websocket proxy console access encryption (websockets_ssl_key/cert setting required)
Login delegation logout URL
Empty
	Redirect your users to this url on logout (authorize_login_delegation should also be enabled)
Authorize login delegation auth source user autocreate
External
	Name of the external auth source where unknown externally authentication users (see authorize_login_delegation) should be created. Empty means no autocreation.
Authorize login delegation
No
	Authorize login delegation with REMOTE_USER HTTP header
Authorize login delegation API
No
	Authorize login delegation with REMOTE_USER HTTP header for API calls too
Idle timeout
60
	Log out idle users after a certain number of minutes
BCrypt password cost
9
	Cost value of bcrypt password hash function for internal auth-sources (4-30). A higher value is safer but verification is slower, particularly for stateless API calls and UI logins. A password change is needed effect existing passwords.
BMC credentials access
Yes
	Permits access to BMC interface passwords through ENC YAML output and in templates
OIDC JWKs URL
Empty
	OpenID Connect JSON Web Key Set(JWKS) URL. Typically https://keycloak.example.com/auth/realms/<realm name>/protocol/openid-connect/certs when using Keycloak as an OpenID provider
OIDC Audience
[]
	Name of the OpenID Connect Audience that is being used for Authentication. In case of Keycloak this is the Client ID.
OIDC Issuer
Empty
	The iss (issuer) claim identifies the principal that issued the JWT, which exists at a `/.well-known/openid-configuration` in case of most of the OpenID providers.
OIDC Algorithm
Empty
	The algorithm used to encode the JWT in the OpenID provider.

|====
| Setting | Default Value | Description
| *OAuth active* | Yes | {Project} will use OAuth for API authorization.
| *OAuth consumer key* | \\***** | OAuth consumer key.
| *OAuth consumer secret* | \\***** | OAuth consumer secret.
| *OAuth map users* | No | {Project} maps users by username in the request-header.
If this is disabled, OAuth requests have administrator rights.
| *Failed login attempts limit* | 30 | {Project} blocks user logins from an incoming IP address for 5 minutes after the specified number of failed login attempts.
Set to 0 to disable brute force protection.
| *Restrict registered {SmartProxies}* | Yes | Only known {SmartProxies} can access features that use {SmartProxy} authentication.
ifdef::satellite[]
| *Require SSL for capsules* | Yes | Client SSL certificates are used to identify {SmartProxies} (`:require_ssl` should also be enabled).
endif::[]
| *Trusted hosts* | [] | List of hostnames, IPv4, IPv6 addresses or subnets to be trusted in addition to {SmartProxies} for access to fact/report importers and ENC output.
| *SSL certificate* | `/etc/foreman/client_cert.pem` | SSL Certificate path that {Project} uses to communicate with its proxies.
| *SSL CA file* | `/etc/foreman/proxy_ca.pem` | SSL CA file path that {Project} uses to communicate with its proxies.
| *SSL private key* | `/etc/foreman/client_key.pem` | SSL Private Key path that {Project} uses to communicate with its proxies.
| *SSL client DN env* | HTTP_SSL_CLIENT_S_DN | Environment variable containing the subject DN from a client SSL certificate.
| *SSL client verify env* | HTTP_SSL_CLIENT_VERIFY | Environment variable containing the verification status of a client SSL certificate.
| *SSL client cert env* | HTTP_SSL_CLIENT_CERT | Environment variable containing a client's SSL certificate.
| *Server CA file* | | SSL CA file path used in templates to verify the connection to {Project}.
| *Websockets SSL key* | `etc/pki/katello/private/katello-apache.key` | Private key file path that {Project} uses to encrypt websockets.
| *Websockets SSL certificate* | `/etc/pki/katello/certs/katello-apache.crt` | Certificate path that {Project} uses to encrypt websockets.
| *Websockets encryption* | Yes | VNC/SPICE websocket proxy console access encryption (`websockets_ssl_key/cert` setting required).
| *Login delegation logout URL* | | Redirect your users to this URL on logout.
Enable *Authorize login delegation* also.
| *Authorize login delegation auth source user autocreate* | External | Name of the external authentication source where unknown externally authenticated users (see *Authorize login delegation*) are created.
Empty means no autocreation.
| *Authorize login delegation* | No | Authorize login delegation with `REMOTE_USER HTTP` header.
| *Authorize login delegation API* | No | Authorize login delegation with `REMOTE_USER HTTP` header for API calls too.
| *Idle timeout* | 60 | Log out idle users after the specified number of minutes.
| *BCrypt password cost* | 9 | Cost value of bcrypt password hash function for internal auth-sources (4-30).
A higher value is safer but verification is slower, particularly for stateless API calls and UI logins.
A password change is needed to affect existing passwords.
| *BMC credentials access* | Yes | Permits access to BMC interface passwords through ENC YAML output and in templates.
| *OIDC JWKs URL* | | OpenID Connect _JSON Web Key Set_ (JWKS) URL.
Typically `\https://keycloak.example.com/auth/realms/<realm name>/protocol/openid-connect/certs` when using Keycloak as an OpenID provider.
| *OIDC Audience* | [] | Name of the OpenID Connect Audience that is being used for authentication.
In the case of Keycloak this is the Client ID.
| *OIDC Issuer* | | The issuer claim identifies the principal that issued the _JSON Web tokens_ (JWT), which exists at a `/.well-known/openid-configuration` in case of most of the OpenID providers.
| *OIDC Algorithm* | | The algorithm used to encode the JWT in the OpenID provider.

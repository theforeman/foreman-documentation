= Synchronizing Content Between {Project} Servers

{ProjectName} uses Inter-Server Synchronization (ISS) to synchronize content between two {ProjectServer}s in a multi-server {Project} setup.

You can use ISS in cases such as:

* If you want to copy some but not all content from your {ProjectServer} to other {ProjectServer}s.
For example, you have Content Views that your IT department consumes from {ProjectServer}, and you want to copy content from those Content Views to other {ProjectServer}s.
* If you want to copy all Library content from your {ProjectServer} to another {ProjectServer}s.
For example, you have Products and repositories that your IT department consumes from {ProjectServer} in the Library, and you want to copy all Products and repositories in that organization to other {ProjectServer}s.

You can either synchronize content over a network if your downstream {ProjectServer}s communicate with an upstream {ProjectServer}, or use the export/import workflow if your {ProjectServer}s are air-gapped.

You cannot use ISS to synchronize content from {ProjectServer} to {SmartProxyServer}.
{SmartProxyServer} supports synchronization natively.

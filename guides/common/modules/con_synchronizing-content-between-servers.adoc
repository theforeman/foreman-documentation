[id="Synchronizing_Content_Between_Servers_{context}"]
= Synchronizing content between {ProjectServerTitle}s

In a {Project} setup with multiple {ProjectServer}s, you can use {ISS} (ISS) to synchronize content from one upstream server to one or more downstream servers.

ifndef::satellite[]
There are two possible ISS configurations of {Project}, depending on how you deployed your infrastructure:

ISS Network Sync::
If your upstream server can communicate with the downstream server over a network, you can synchronize content over HTTPS.
+
Configure your {Project} to synchronize content over a network.
For more information, see xref:configuring-server-to-synchronize-content-over-a-network_{context}[].

ISS Export Sync::
If your upstream and downstream servers are air-gapped, you can synchronize content using export and import.
+
Configure your {Project} to synchronize content using export and import.
For more information, see xref:configuring-server-to-sync-content-using-exports_{context}[].

There are two possible ISS configurations of {Project}, depending on how you deployed your infrastructure.
Configure your {Project} for ISS as appropriate for your use case scenario.
For more information, see {InstallingServerDisconnectedDocURL}how-to-configure-inter-server-sync_{project-context}[How to Configure {ISS}] in _{InstallingServerDisconnectedDocTitle}_.
To change the pulp export path, see the Knowledgebase article https://access.redhat.com/solutions/7013903[Hammer content export fails with "Path '/the/path' is not an allowed export path"] on the Red{nbsp}Hat Customer Portal.

= Synchronizing Content Between {ProjectServerTitle}s

In a {Project} setup with multiple {ProjectServer}s, you can use Inter-Server Synchronization (ISS) to synchronize content from one upstream server to one or more downstream servers.

ifndef::satellite[]
There are two possible ISS configurations of {Project}, depending on how you deployed your infrastructure:

ISS Network Sync::
If your upstream server can communicate with the downstream server over a network, you can synchronize content over HTTPS.
+
Configure your {Project} to synchronize content over a network.
For more information, see xref:configuring-server-to-synchronize-content-over-a-network_{context}[].

ISS Export Sync::
If your upstream and downstream servers are air-gapped, you can synchronize content using export and import.
+
Configure your {Project} to synchronize content using export and import.
For more information, see xref:configuring-server-to-sync-content-using-exports_{context}[].

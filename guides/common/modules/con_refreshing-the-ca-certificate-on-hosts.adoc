= Refreshing the CA certificate on hosts

When you change the CA certificate on your {ProjectServer}, you must refresh the CA certificate on your hosts.

Ensure that you use a temporary dual CA certificate file for uninterrupted operation.
For more information, see {AdministeringDocURL}planning-for-ca-certificate-renewal[Planning for CA certificate renewal] in _{AdministeringDocTitle}_.

If you have already changed the CA certificate on {ProjectServer} without using the temporary dual CA certificate file, you must refresh the certificate on hosts manually because the scripted variant will not recognize {ProjectServer}.

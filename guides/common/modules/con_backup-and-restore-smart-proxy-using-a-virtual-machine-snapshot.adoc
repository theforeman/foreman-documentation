= Backup and Restore {SmartProxyServerTitle} Using a Virtual Machine Snapshot

If your {SmartProxyServer} is a virtual machine, you can restore it from a snapshot.
Creating weekly snapshots to restore from is recommended.
In the event of failure, you can install, or configure a new {SmartProxyServer}, and then synchronize the database content from {ProjectServer}.

If required, deploy a new {SmartProxyServer}, ensuring the host name is the same as before, and then install the {SmartProxy} certificates.
You may still have them on {ProjectServer}, the package name ends in -certs.tar, alternately create new ones.
Follow the procedures in {InstallingSmartProxyDocURL}[Installing {SmartProxyServer}] until you can confirm, in the {ProjectWebUI}, that {SmartProxyServer} is connected to {ProjectServer}.
Then use the procedure xref:Synchronizing_Content_from_{project-context}_Server_to_{smart-proxy-context-titlecase}_Servers_{context}[] to synchronize from {Project}.

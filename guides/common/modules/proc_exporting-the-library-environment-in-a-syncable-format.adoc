= Exporting the library environment in a syncable format

You can export content in the Library environment of an organization to a syncable format that you can use to create your custom CDN and synchronize the content from the custom CDN over HTTP/HTTPS.

You can then serve the generated content on a local web server and synchronize it on the importing {ProjectServer} or in another {ProjectServer} organization.
endif::[]

You can use the generated content to create the same repository in another {ProjectServer} or in another {ProjectServer} organization by using content import.
On import of the exported archive, a regular content view is created or updated on your importing {ProjectServer}.
For more information, see xref:Importing_a_Content_View_Version_{context}[].

The export contains directories with the packages, *listing* files, and metadata of the repository in Yum format that can be used to synchronize in the importing {ProjectServer}.

.Prerequisites
* Ensure that you set the download policy to *Immediate* for all repositories within the Library lifecycle environment you export.
For more information, see xref:Download_Policies_Overview_{context}[].
* Ensure that you synchronize products you export to the required date.
* Ensure that the user exporting the content has the `Content Exporter` role.

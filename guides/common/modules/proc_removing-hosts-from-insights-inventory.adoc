= Removing hosts from the {Insights} Inventory

[role="_abstract"]
When hosts are removed from {Project}, they can also be removed from the inventory of {Insights}, either automatically or manually.
You can configure automatic removal of hosts from the {Insights} Inventory during {RHCloud} synchronization with {Project} that occurs daily by default.

If you leave the setting disabled, you can still remove the bulk of hosts from the Inventory manually.

If *Automatic mismatch deletion* is enabled, {Project} removes any hosts from the {RHCloud} that are not registered in {Project}. 
Enable this setting only when all hosts are registered through {Project}. 
If any hosts are registered through other {Project} instances or directly to the {RHCloud}, {Project} deletes them.

.Prerequisites
* Your {Project} account has a role that grants the `view_foreman_rh_cloud` and `edit_settings` permissions.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *{Insights}* > *Inventory Upload*.
. Enable the *Automatic mismatch deletion* setting.

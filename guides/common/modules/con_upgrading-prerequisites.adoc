== Prerequisites

Upgrading to {Project} {ProjectVersion} affects your entire {Project} infrastructure.
Before proceeding, complete the following:

* Read the {ProjectName} {ProjectVersion} {ReleaseNotesDocURL}[Release Notes].
* Ensure that you have sufficient storage space on your server.
For more information, see {InstallingServerDocURL}Preparing_your_Environment_for_Installation_{project-context}[Preparing your Environment for Installation] in _{InstallingServerDocTitle}_ and {InstallingSmartProxyDocURL}preparing-environment-for-capsule-installation[Preparing your Environment for Installation] in _Installing {SmartProxyServer}_.

* Ensure that you have at least the same amount of free space on `{postgresql-lib-dir}` as that consumed by `{postgresql-data-dir}`.
Upgrading to {Project} {ProjectVersion} involves a PostgreSQL 12 to PostgreSQL 13 upgrade.
The contents of `{postgresql-data-dir}` are backed up during the PostgreSQL upgrade.

* Back up your {ProjectServer} and all {SmartProxyServers}.
For more information, see {AdministeringDocURL}backing-up-{project-context}-server-and-{smart-proxy-context}_admin[Backing Up {ProjectServer} and {SmartProxyServer}] in _{AdministeringDocTitle}_.
* Plan for updating any scripts you use that contain {Project} API commands because some API commands differ between versions of {Project}.

* Migrate all organizations to Simple Content Access (SCA).
For more information, see the Red Hat Knowledgebase solution https://access.redhat.com/articles/simple-content-access[Simple Content Access]. 

Ensure that all {ProjectServer}s are on the same version.

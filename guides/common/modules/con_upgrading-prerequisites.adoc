== Prerequisites

Upgrading to {Project} {ProjectVersion} affects your entire {Project} infrastructure.
Before proceeding, complete the following:

* Read the {ProjectName} {ProjectVersion} {ReleaseNotesDocURL}[Release Notes].
* Ensure that you have sufficient storage space on your server.
For more information, see {InstallingServerDocURL}Preparing_your_Environment_for_Installation_{project-context}[Preparing your Environment for Installation] in _{InstallingServerDocTitle}_ and {InstallingSmartProxyDocURL}preparing-environment-for-capsule-installation[Preparing your Environment for Installation] in _Installing {SmartProxyServer}_.
* Back up your {ProjectServer} and all {SmartProxyServers}.
For more information, see {AdministeringDocURL}backing-up-{project-context}-server-and-{smart-proxy-context}_admin[Backing Up {ProjectServer} and {SmartProxyServer}] in _{AdministeringDocTitle}_.

= Managing Red Hat subscriptions

{ProjectName} can import content from the Red{nbsp}Hat Content Delivery Network (CDN).
{Project} requires a Red{nbsp}Hat subscription manifest to find, access, and download content from the corresponding repositories.
You must have a Red{nbsp}Hat subscription manifest containing a subscription allocation for each organization on {ProjectServer}.
All subscription information is available on `console.redhat.com`.

Use this chapter to import a Red{nbsp}Hat subscription manifest and manage the manifest within the {ProjectWebUI}.

.Subscription allocations and organizations
You can manage more than one organization if you have more than one subscription allocation.
{Project} requires a single allocation for each organization configured in {ProjectServer}.
The advantage of this is that each organization maintains separate subscriptions so that you can support multiple organizations, each with their own Red{nbsp}Hat accounts.

.Future-dated subscriptions
You can use future-dated subscriptions in a subscription manifest.
When you add future-dated subscriptions to your manifest before the expiry date of the existing subscriptions, you can have uninterrupted access to repositories.

.Subscriptions service capabilities
The Subscriptions service is a service that helps organizations track and manage their Red{nbsp}Hat subscription usage across connected and disconnected environments. 
* Allows customers to view subscription usage.
* When configured, it displays usage data from both connected and disconnected environments.
* Tracks Red{nbsp}Hat product usage and capacity at the fleet or account level.
* Generates a daily snapshot of usage data across all tracked systems.
* Displays data in a filterable dashboard at cloud.redhat.com.
* Collects historical data for analytics, purchasing decisions, capacity planning, and risk mitigation.
* Supports the transition to Simple Content Access (SCA), which enforces subscriptions across the organization rather than on individual systems.

.Configuring your system to use the Subscriptions service

ifndef::satellite[]
Connected {Project} Users::
Connected {Project} Users should configure the `foreman_rh_cloud` plugin to share inventory information with the Hybrid Cloud Console.
The plugin enables the usage of the subscriptions service to track usage information across connected systems.

The plugin can be configured to omit data that is not pertinent for subscription purposes, such as host names and IP addresses.
endif::[]

Disconnected users::
Users who cannot or do not want to connect directly can export a local summary of their product usage and import it into a CMDB, spreadsheet, or other tracking tools.

Disconnected ({Project})::
{Project} users can export usage data in one of two ways:

** Through the `foreman_rh_cloud` plugin, which generates its report locally and allows you the ability to download it. 
This report is in JSON format and is most suitable for automated scripts or machine ingestion. 
This report can also be generated through the `foreman-rake` command.

# foreman-rake rh_cloud_inventory:report:generate

** Through the *Host - Installed Products* report by navigating to *Monitor* > *Reports* > *Report Templates*. 
This report can be exported in multiple formats, including CSV, HTML, and YAML, for use in spreadsheet tools or other applications.

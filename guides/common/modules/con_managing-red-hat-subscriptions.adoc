= Managing Red Hat subscriptions

{ProjectName} can import content from the Red{nbsp}Hat Content Delivery Network (CDN).
{Project} requires a Red{nbsp}Hat subscription manifest to find, access, and download content from the corresponding repositories.
You must have a Red{nbsp}Hat subscription manifest containing a subscription allocation for each organization on {ProjectServer}.
All subscription information is available in your Red Hat Customer Portal account.

Use this chapter to import a Red{nbsp}Hat subscription manifest and manage the manifest within the {ProjectWebUI}.

.Subscription allocations and organizations

You can manage more than one organization if you have more than one subscription allocation.
{Project} requires a single allocation for each organization configured in {ProjectServer}.
The advantage of this is that each organization maintains separate subscriptions so that you can support multiple organizations, each with their own Red Hat accounts.

.Future-dated subscriptions

You can use future-dated subscriptions in a subscription manifest.
When you add future-dated subscriptions to your manifest before the expiry date of the existing subscriptions, you can have uninterrupted access to repositories.

.Prerequisites

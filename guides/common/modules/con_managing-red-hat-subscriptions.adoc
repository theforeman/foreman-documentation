= Managing Red Hat subscriptions

{ProjectName} can import content from the {Team} Content Delivery Network (CDN).
{Project} requires a {Team} subscription manifest to find, access, and download content from the corresponding repositories.
You must have a {Team} subscription manifest containing a subscription allocation for each organization on {ProjectServer}.
All subscription information is available in your {Team} Customer Portal account.

Use this chapter to import a {Team} subscription manifest and manage the manifest within the {ProjectWebUI}.

.Subscription allocations and organizations
You can manage more than one organization if you have more than one subscription allocation.
{Project} requires a single allocation for each organization configured in {ProjectServer}.
The advantage of this is that each organization maintains separate subscriptions so that you can support multiple organizations, each with their own {Team} accounts.

.Future-dated subscriptions
You can use future-dated subscriptions in a subscription manifest.
When you add future-dated subscriptions to your manifest before the expiry date of the existing subscriptions, you can have uninterrupted access to repositories.

.Subscriptions service capabilities
* Allows customers to view subscription usage.
* When configured, it displays usage data from both connected and disconnected environments.
* Tracks {Team} product usage and capacity at the fleet or account level.
* Generates a daily snapshot of usage data across all tracked systems.
* Displays data in a filterable dashboard at cloud.redhat.com.
* Collects historical data for analytics, purchasing decisions, capacity planning, and risk mitigation.
* Supports the transition to Simple Content Access (SCA), which enforces subscriptions across the organization rather than on individual systems.

.Configuring your system to use the Subscriptions service

Connected (Non-{Project}) users::
As a connected, non-{Project} user, no further action needs to be taken to use the subscriptions service. 
To track your subscription usage, log in to the Hybrid Cloud Console at https://console.redhat.com/subscriptions/usage/rhel. 
Registering a system through the guidance in https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/subscription_central/1-latest/html-single/getting_started_with_rhel_system_registration/index[Getting Started with RHEL System Registration] is sufficient to ensure the system is properly counted. 
It is recommended to set System Purpose attributes to define SLA and USAGE.
This improves filtering and enhances reporting in the Subscriptions service.
For more information, see {RHELDocsBaseURL}9/html/automatically_installing_rhel/proc_configuring-system-purpose-using-the-subscription-manager-command-line-tool_rhel-installer[Configuring System Purpose using the subscription-manager command-line tool].

Connected {Project} Users::
Connected {Project} Users should enable the `foreman_rh_cloud` plugin if it has not been enabled already (https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/subscription_central/1-latest/html/getting_started_with_the_subscriptions_service/proc-installing-satellite-inventory-upload-plugin_assembly-setting-up-subscriptionwatch-ctxt). The foreman_rh_cloud plugin shares inventory with the Hybrid Cloud Console enabling the usage of the subscriptions service to track usage information.

The plugin can be configured to omit data that is not pertinent for subscription purposes, such as host names and IP addresses.
endif::[]

Disconnected users::
Users who cannot or do not want to connect directly can export a local summary of their product usage and import it into a CMDB, spreadsheet, or other tracking tools.

Disconnected (No {Project})::
Disconnected users can generate a local report using tools such as {Project}. 
Disconnected {Project} users can use `foreman_rh_cloud` reports or the {Project} host installed products report.
Users without {Project} can query standalone RHEL systems with {Team} Discovery.
For more information about {Team} Discovery, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/subscription_central/1-latest/html-single/installing_and_configuring_discovery/index#con-what-is-prod-common_assembly-about-common-ctxt[What is Discovery?].
Alternatively, you can leverage any tool, whether provided by {Team} or another source, to track your subscription usage.
Some users prefer to review usage reports before sending them to the Hybrid Cloud Console. 
Discovery allows users to upload reports manually as needed.

Disconnected ({Project})::
{Project} users can export usage data in one of two ways:

** Through the `foreman_rh_cloud` plugin, which generates its report locally and allows you the ability to download it. 
This report is in JSON format and is most suitable for automated scripts or machine ingestion. 
This report can also be generated through the `foreman-rake` command.
For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/1752433[Satellite 6 : Running foreman-rake console with the possibility to rollback any changes].

** Through the *Host - Installed Products* report by navigating to *Monitor* > *Reports* > *Report Templates*. 
This report can be exported in multiple formats, including CSV, HTML, and YAML, for use in spreadsheet tools or other applications.

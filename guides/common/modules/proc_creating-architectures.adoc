= Creating Architectures

An architecture in {Project} represents a logical grouping of hosts and operating systems. Architectures are created by {Project} automatically when hosts check in with Puppet. Basic i386 and x86_64 architectures are already preset in {Project}.

Use this procedure to create an architecture in {Project}.

:FeatureName: {advisorengine}
include::snip_technology-preview.adoc[]

{advisorengine} analyzes system health and configuration by applying predefined rules to a small set of local data, such as installed packages, running services, and configuration settings.
When you install {advisorengine} locally, you can generate Insights recommendations without sending system data to Red{nbsp}Hat services.

[IMPORTANT]
====
With {advisorengine} enabled, you cannot use the hosted Insights services for hosts registered to your {Project}.
Enabling {advisorengine} prevents you from using any Red{nbsp}Hat Hybrid Cloud Console services on the registered hosts.

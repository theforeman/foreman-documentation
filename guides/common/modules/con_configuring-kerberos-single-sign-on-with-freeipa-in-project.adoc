= Configuring Kerberos single sign-on with {FreeIPA} in {Project}

{FreeIPA} is an open-source identity management solution that provides centralized authentication, authorization, and account management services.
With {Project}, you can integrate {ProjectServer} with your existing {FreeIPA} server to enable {FreeIPA} users to authenticate to {Project}.

With your {FreeIPA} server configured as an external identity provider, users defined in {FreeIPA} can log in to {Project} with their {FreeIPA} credentials.
If a cross-forest trust is configured between {FreeIPA} and Active{nbsp}Directory, Active{nbsp}Directory users can also log in to {Project}.

The following login methods are available for {FreeIPA} users:

* Username and password
* Kerberos single sign-on

When a cross-forest trust is configured between {FreeIPA} and Active{nbsp}Directory, Active{nbsp}Directory users can log in to {Project} with their user principal name (UPN) and password.

You can then serve the generated content using a local webserver on the importing {ProjectServer} or in another {ProjectServer} organization.

You cannot directly import Syncable Format exports. Instead on the importing {ProjectServer} you would need to:

* Copy the generated content to an HTTP/HTTPS webserver that is accessible to importing {ProjectServer}.
* Update your CDN configuration to *Custom CDN*.
* Set the CDN URL to point to the web server.
* Optionally set a SSL CA Credential if the web server requires it.
* Enable the Repository.
* Synchronize the Repository.
endif::[]

ifndef::satellite[]
You can use the generated content to create the same repository in another {ProjectServer} or in another {ProjectServer} organization via content import.
endif::[]

You can export the following content in a syncable format from {ProjectServer}:

* RPM repositories
* Kickstart repositories
* File repositories

You cannot export Ansible and Docker content.

The export contains the following data:

Directories containing the RPMs, *listing* files and metadata of the repository in yum format that can be used to synchronize in the importing {ProjectServer}.

.Prerequisite

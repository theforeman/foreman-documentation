[role="_abstract"]
{SmartProxyServers} provide local host management services. With the Katello plug-in, they can also mirror content from {ProjectServer}.

ifdef::satellite[]
When {SmartProxy} mirrors content from {ProjectServer}, it provides the following functionalities:
endif::[]
ifndef::satellite[]
If you have the Katello plug-in installed, you can use {SmartProxy} to mirror content from {ProjectServer}:
endif::[]

Repository synchronization::
{SmartProxyServers} pull content from selected life cycle environments on the {ProjectServer} and make this content available to the hosts they manage.
The Pulp open source project provides this functionality.

Content delivery::
Hosts configured to use {SmartProxyServer} download content from that {SmartProxy} rather than from the central {ProjectServer}.
The Pulp open source project provides this functionality.

Host action delivery::
{SmartProxyServer} executes scheduled actions on hosts.

Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) proxy::
Hosts are registered to their associated {SmartProxyServers} rather than to the central {ProjectServer} or the Red{nbsp}Hat Customer Portal.
The Candlepin open source project provides this functionality.

You can use {SmartProxy} to run the following services for infrastructure and host management:

DHCP::
{SmartProxy} can manage a DHCP server, including integration with an existing solution, such as ISC DHCP servers, Active Directory, and Libvirt instances.

DNS::
{SmartProxy} can manage a DNS server, including integration with an existing solution, such as ISC BIND and Active Directory.

TFTP::
{SmartProxy} can integrate with any UNIX-based TFTP server.

Realm::
{SmartProxy} can manage Kerberos realms or domains so that hosts can join them automatically during provisioning.
{SmartProxy} can integrate with an existing infrastructure, including {FreeIPA} and Active Directory.

Puppet server::
{SmartProxy} can act as a configuration management server by running a Puppet server.

Puppet Certificate Authority::
{SmartProxy} can integrate with the Puppet certificate authority (CA) to provide certificates to hosts.

Baseboard Management Controller (BMC)::
{SmartProxy} can provide power management for hosts by using the Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) or Redfish standards.

Provisioning template proxy::
{SmartProxy} can serve provisioning templates to hosts.

OpenSCAP::
{SmartProxy} can perform security compliance scans on hosts.

Remote Execution (REX)::
{SmartProxy} can run remote job execution on hosts.

You can configure a {SmartProxyServer} for a specific limited purpose by enabling only selected features on that {SmartProxy}.
Common configurations include the following:

Infrastructure {SmartProxies}: DNS + DHCP + TFTP::
{SmartProxies} with these services provide infrastructure services for hosts and have all necessary services for provisioning new hosts.

Content {SmartProxies}: Pulp::
{SmartProxies} with this service provide content synchronized from {ProjectServer} to hosts.

Configuration {SmartProxies}: Pulp + Puppet + PuppetCA::
{SmartProxies} with these services provide content and run configuration services for hosts.

All-in-one {SmartProxies}: DNS + DHCP + TFTP + Pulp + Puppet + PuppetCA::
{SmartProxies} with these services provide a full set of {SmartProxy} features.
By configuring an all-in-one {SmartProxy}, you can isolate hosts assigned to that {SmartProxy} by providing a single point of connection for the hosts.

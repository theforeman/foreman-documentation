= Customizing Ansible Configuration

{Project} manages essential Ansible configuration that is required for Ansible integration with {Project}.
However, you can customize other Ansible configuration options as usual.

{Project} stores the essential Ansible configuration as environment variables in `/etc/foreman-proxy/ansible.env`.
This file is managed by the {foreman-installer}.

Ansible reads configuration from a configuration file and the environment provided by {SmartProxy}.
If you need to customize Ansible configuration, you can do so in the system-wide `/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg` file or in the `/usr/share/foreman-proxy/.ansible.cfg` file in the home directory of the `foreman-proxy` user.
Note that if you use `/usr/share/foreman-proxy/.ansible.cfg`, Ansible spawned by {Project} ignores configuration in `/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg`.

Note that environment variables take precedence over values in `ansible.cfg`, which ensures that the essential configuration required by {Project} is retained.

The following table lists the essential Ansible configuration options managed by {Project}.

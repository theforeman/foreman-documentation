= Using network boot to provision hosts

You can provision hosts with {ProjectName} by booting hosts over a network when you can configure provisioning infrastructure services, such as the DHCP and TFTP services.
Once the host boots, {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer} provides operating system installation content that the host downloads.
When the operating system is installed, the host registers to {Project} and {Project} performs an initial configuration of the host.

.BIOS and UEFI interfaces
Both BIOS and UEFI interfaces work as interpreters between the operating system and firmware of a computer, initializing hardware components and starting the operating system at boot time.
With {Project}, you can perform both BIOS and UEFI based PXE provisioning.
For UEFI interfaces with an HTTP boot client, you can also perform UEFI HTTP provisioning.

.Bonded network interfaces
You can configure a bonded interface that {Project} will use during the installation process, for example, to download installation content.
After provisioning completes, the provisioned system can also use the bonded interface.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{Project} cannot PXE boot a bonded interface that requires configuration on a network switch as well as on your host.

After your host loads the kernel of an installer or the kernel of an operating system, bonding works as expected.
Therefore, you can use a boot disk to work around PXE boot limitations when your bonded interface requires configuration on both a switch and your host.

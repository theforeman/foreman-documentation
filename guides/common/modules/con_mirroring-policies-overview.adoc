= Mirroring policies overview

Mirroring keeps the local repository exactly in synchronization with the upstream repository.
If any content is removed from the upstream repository since the last synchronization, with the next synchronization, it will be removed from the local repository as well.

You can use mirroring policies for finer control over mirroring of repodata and content when synchronizing a repository.
For example, if it is not possible to mirror the repodata for a repository, you can set the mirroring policy to mirror only content for this repository.

{ProjectServer} has the following mirroring policies:

Additive::
Neither the content nor the repodata is mirrored.
Thus, only new content added since the last synchronization is added to the local repository and nothing is removed.

Content Only::
Mirrors only content and not the repodata.
Some repositories do not support metadata mirroring, in such cases you can set the mirroring policy to content only to only mirror the content.

Complete Mirroring::
Mirrors content as well as repodata.
This is the fastest method.
This mirroring policy is only available for Yum content.

[WARNING]
====
Avoid republishing metadata for repositories with Complete Mirror mirroring policy.
This also applies to content views containing repositories with the Complete Mirror mirroring policy.

= Uploading Additional SCAP Content

You can upload additional SCAP content into {ProjectServer}, either content created by yourself or obtained elsewhere.
For example, you can get the latest OpenSCAP contents for additional systems from the https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/content/releases[SSG GitHub repository].
To use the CLI instead of the {ProjectWebUI}, see the xref:cli-Uploading_Additional_SCAP_Content_{context}[CLI procedure].

.Prerequisite
* Your user account has a role assigned that has the `create_scap_contents` permission.
* You have downloaded a SCAP content archive file.

.Procedure
. Unpack the SCAP content archive file on your local machine.
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Hosts* > *Compliance {endash} SCAP contents*.
. Click *Upload New SCAP Content*.
. Enter a title in the *Title* text box, such as `_My SCAP Content_`.
. In *Scap File*, click *Choose file*, navigate to the location containing a SCAP data-stream file and click *Open*.
. On the *Locations* tab, select locations.
. On the *Organizations* tab, select organizations.
. Click *Submit*.

If the SCAP content file is loaded successfully, a message similar to `Successfully created _My SCAP Content_` is displayed.

= Enabling the installer-managed DNS service

If you do not have a DNS server available in your network, you can use the installer-managed DNS service. This feature enables you to provide a DNS service with a low maintenance effort.

Perform the steps on the {Project} or {SmartProxyServer} that you want to configure to manage the DNS service for the domain.


.Procedure

. Configure {Project} or {SmartProxy} as DNS server:
+
[options="nowrap",subs="+quotes,attributes"]
....
# {foreman-installer} \
--foreman-proxy-dns true \
--foreman-proxy-dns-provider nsupdate \
--foreman-proxy-dns-managed true \
--reset-foreman-proxy-dns-server
....

. For each affected {SmartProxy}, update the configuration of that {SmartProxy} in the {ProjectWebUI}. See xref:associating-the-dns-service-with-a-domain-and-subnet[].

= {SmartProxy} Performance Tests

As of now testing for {SmartProxy} tuning recommendations is ongoing, but we are sharing some initial results here already.
We have measured multiple test cases on multiple {SmartProxy} configurations:

[width="79%",cols="48%,19%,33%",options="header",]
|===
|{SmartProxy} HW configuration |CPUs |RAM
|minimal |4 |12 GiB
|large |8 |24 GiB
|extra large |16 |46 GiB
|===

For concurrent registrations a bottleneck is CPU speed, but all configs were able to handle even high concurrency without swapping.

We have tested executing Remote Execution jobs via both SSH and Ansible backend on 500, 2000 and 4000 hosts.
All configurations were able to handle all of the tests without errors, except for the smallest configuration (4 CPUs and 12 GiB memory) which failed to finish on all 4000 hosts.

In a sync test where we synced {RHEL} 6, 7, 8 BaseOS and 8 AppStream we have not seen significant differences amongst {SmartProxy} configurations.
This will be different for syncing a higher number of content views in parallel.

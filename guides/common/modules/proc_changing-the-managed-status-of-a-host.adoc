= Changing the Managed Status of a Host

Hosts provisioned by {Project} are Managed by default.
When a host is set to Managed, you can configure additional host parameters from {ProjectServer}.
These additional parameters are listed on the *Operating System* tab.
If you change any settings on the *Operating System* tab, they will not take effect until you set the host to build and reboot it.

If you need to obtain reports about configuration management on systems using an operating system not supported by {Project}, set the host to Unmanaged.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Hosts* > *All hosts*.
. Select the host.
. Click *Edit*.
. Click *Manage host* or *Unmanage host* to change the host's status.
. Click *Submit*.

= Changing the managed status of a host

[role="_abstract"]
Hosts provisioned by {Project} are Managed by default.
When a host is set to Managed, you can configure additional host parameters from {ProjectServer}.

Additional host parameters that you can configure for your hosts are listed on the *Operating System* tab.
If you change any settings on the *Operating System* tab, they will not take effect until you set the host to build and reboot it.

If you need to obtain reports about configuration management on systems using an operating system not supported by {Project}, set the host to Unmanaged.

.Procedure

. Click the name of the host you want to modify.
. Click *Edit*.
. Click *Manage host* or *Unmanage host* to change the host's status.
. Click *Submit*.

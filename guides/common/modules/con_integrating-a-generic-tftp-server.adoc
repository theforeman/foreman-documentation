= Integrating a generic TFTP server

If you have an existing TFTP server in your network, you can integrate it into {Project} to perform unattended installations.
If the installer does not manages the TFTP service, you must share the root directory of the TFTP service over the network to enable {Project} to access the files.
However, in this case, {Project} does not manage the files on the TFTP server.

[NOTE]
====
If you prefer a low maintenance solution that also manages files on the TFTP server, prefer the installer-managed TFTP service.

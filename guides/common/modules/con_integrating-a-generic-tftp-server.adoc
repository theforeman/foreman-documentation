= Integrating a generic TFTP server

If you have a TFTP server in your network, you can integrate this service into your {Project}.
The integration enables you to continue using your existing TFTP server.
With this type of integration, {Project} uses the Network File System (NFS) protocol to access the root directory of the TFTP service.

[NOTE]
====
If you prefer a low maintenance solution that also manages files on the TFTP server, use the installer-managed TFTP service.

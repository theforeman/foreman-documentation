= Integrating Route 53 DNS

[role="_abstract"]
If you have an Amazon Route 53 DNS service in your network, you can integrate this service into {ProjectServer}.
The integration enables you to continue using your existing DNS server, and {Project} manages DNS records for hosts during their life cycle.

With this type of integration, {Project} uses the Route 53 API to authenticate and manage DNS records in Amazon Web Services (AWS).

.Procedure
. Configure {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer} to connect to the Amazon Route 53 DNS service:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-installer} \
--foreman-proxy-dns true \
--foreman-proxy-dns-provider route53 \
--enable-foreman-proxy-plugin-dns-route53 \
--foreman-proxy-plugin-dns-route53-aws-access-key _My_AWS_Access_Key_ \
--foreman-proxy-plugin-dns-route53-aws-secret-key _My_AWS_Secret_Key_
----
. For each affected {SmartProxy}, update the configuration of that {SmartProxy} in the {ProjectWebUI}.

= Updating {Project} to the next patch version

[role="_abstract"]
You can update your {ProjectServer} and {SmartProxyServer} to a new patch release version, such as from {ProjectVersion}.0 to {ProjectVersion}.1, by using the {Project} maintain tool.
The patch releases are non-disruptive to your operating environment and often fast.

Always update {ProjectServer}, {SmartProxyServer}, or the operating system by using `{foreman-maintain} update`.
If there are pending {ProjectServer} updates, updating the operating system will update both.

Perform updates regularly to resolve security vulnerabilities and other issues.

= Updating {Project} to the next patch version

You can update your {ProjectServer} and {SmartProxyServer} to a new patch release version, such as from {ProjectVersion}.0 to {ProjectVersion}.1, using the {Project} maintain tool.
The patch releases are non-disruptive to your operating environment and often fast.

You can update the underlying operating system.
If there are pending {ProjectServer} updates, updating the operating system will update both.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Perform updates regularly to resolve security vulnerabilities and other issues.

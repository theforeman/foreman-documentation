= Calling the API in Ruby

You can use Ruby with the {Project} API to perform various tasks.

[IMPORTANT]
====
These are example scripts and commands.
Ensure you review these scripts carefully before use, and replace any variables, user names, passwords, and other information to suit your own deployment.

[id="sect-API_Guide-Creating_Objects_Using_Ruby"]
== Creating objects by using Ruby

This script connects to the {ProjectNameX} API and creates an organization, and then creates three lifecycle environments in the organization.
If the organization already exists, the script uses that organization.
If any of the lifecycle environments already exist in the organization, the script raises an error and quits.

== Using apipie bindings with Ruby

Apipie bindings are the Ruby bindings for apipie documented API calls.
They fetch and cache the API definition from {Project} and then generate API calls as needed.

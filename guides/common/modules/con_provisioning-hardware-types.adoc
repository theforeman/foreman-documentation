= Provisioning hardware types

With {ProjectName}, you can provision hosts of the following hardware types.

Bare-metal hosts::
{Project} provisions bare-metal hosts primarily by using network boot and MAC address identification.
When provisioning bare-metal hosts with {Project}, you can do the following:
+
* Create host entries and specify the MAC address of the host to provision.
* Boot blank hosts to the {Project} Discovery service, which creates a pool of hosts that are ready to be provisioned.
* Boot and provision PXE-less hosts by using boot disks.

Virtual machines::
{Project} connects to virtualization infrastructure services, such as {oVirt} and VMware.
You can instruct {Project} to use a particular hardware profile by defining a compute profile.
When provisioning virtual machines with {Project}, you can do the following:
+
* Select which hardware profile to use.
* Provision virtual machines from virtual image templates.
* Use the same provisioning methods that you use to provision bare-metal hosts.

Cloud instances::
{Project} connects to private and public cloud providers to provision instances of hosts from images stored in the cloud environment.
You can instruct {Project} to use a particular hardware profile by defining a compute profile.

= Running Salt

You can run arbitrary Salt functions using {Project}'s remote execution features.

Most commonly, you can run `salt.highstate` on one or more Salt Minions.
This applies all relevant Salt States on your managed hosts.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Hosts > All Hosts*.
. Select one or multiple hosts.
. Click *Run Salt* from the _actions_ drop down menu.
+
Alternatively, you can click *Run Salt* from the _Schedule Remote Job_ drop down menu on the host overview page.

Triggering a remote execution job takes you to the corresponding job overview page.

If you select a host from the list, you can see the output of the remote job in real time.

To view remote jobs, in the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Monitor > Jobs*.

Running `state.highstate` generates a xref:salt_guide_viewing_salt_reports_{context}[Salt report].
Note that reports are uploaded to {Project} every ten minutes.

You can use {Project}'s remote execution features to run arbitrary Salt functions.
This includes an optional test mode that tells you what would happen without actually changing anything.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Hosts > All Hosts*
. Select a host.
. Click *Schedule Remote Job*.
. For the *Job category* field, select _Salt-Call_ from the drop down menu.
. For the *Job template* field, select _Salt Run function_ from the drop down menu.
. In the *Function* field, enter the name of the function that you want to trigger, for example, `pillar.items` or `test.ping`.
. Optional: Click *Display advanced fields* and enable *test-run*.
. Click *Submit* to run the job.

You can also schedule remote jobs or run them recurrently.
For more information, see {ManagingHostsDocURL}Configuring_and_Setting_Up_Remote_Jobs_managing-hosts[Configuring and Setting up Remote Jobs] in the _Managing Hosts_ guide.

Alternatively, you can define recurrent actions using the native Salt way.
For example, you can schedule hourly `state.highstate` runs on individual Salt Minions by extending `/etc/salt/minion`:

[options="nowrap" subs="attributes"]
----
schedule:
  highstate:
    function: state.highstate
    minutes: 60

= Virt-who and virtual machine subscriptions

[role="_abstract"]
Virtual machines (VMs) require host-based {EL} subscriptions instead of physical subscriptions.
Many host-based subscriptions include entitlements for unlimited VMs.

virt-who queries the virtualization platform and reports hypervisor and VM information to {Project}.
You can view your subscription usage by using the Subscriptions service on the {RHCloud}.

You can configure virt-who for the following virtualization platforms:

* {EL} Virtualization (KVM)
* VMware vSphere

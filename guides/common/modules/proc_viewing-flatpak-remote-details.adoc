= Viewing Flatpak remote details

You can view a list of the repositories a scanned Flatpak remote provides.

.Prerequisites
 * Your {Project} account has a role that grants the permissions `view_flatpak_remotes`, `create_flatpak_remotes`, `edit_flatpak_remotes`, and `destroy_flatpak_remotes`. 

* Set up Flatpak. 
For more information, see {RHELDocsBaseURL}9/html/administering_the_system_using_the_gnome_desktop_environment/assembly_installing-applications-using-flatpak_administering-the-system-using-the-gnome-desktop-environment#setting-up-flatpak_assembly_installing-applications-using-flatpak[Setting up Flatpak].

* Flatpak applications rely on Flatpak runtimes. 
For example, `rhel9/firefox-flatpak` depends on `rhel9/flatpak-runtime`. 
* Ensure that runtime repositories are available to clients alongside application repositories for installations to work.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Content* > *Flatpak Remotes*.
. Click the name of the Flatpak remote you want to view.
. The page displays a list of repositories available from the scanned Flatpak remote.

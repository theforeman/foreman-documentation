- Optional: If the default provisioning templates have been changed during the upgrade, recreate any templates cloned from the default templates.
If the custom code is executed before and/or after the provisioning process, use custom provisioning snippets to avoid recreating cloned templates.
For more information about configuring custom provisioning snippets, see {ProvisioningDocURL}Creating_Custom_Provisioning_Snippets_provisioning[Creating Custom Provisioning Snippets] in _{ProvisioningDocTitle}_.
- If you use custom templates, replce `@host.lifecycle_environment` with `@host.single_lifecycle_environment` and `@host.content_view` with `@host.single_content_view`.

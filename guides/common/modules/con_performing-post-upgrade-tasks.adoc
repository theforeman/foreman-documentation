= Performing post-upgrade tasks

* Optional: If the default provisioning templates have been changed during the upgrade, recreate any templates cloned from the default templates.
If the custom code is executed before and/or after the provisioning process, use custom provisioning snippets to avoid recreating cloned templates.
For more information about configuring custom provisioning snippets, see {ProvisioningDocURL}Creating_Custom_Provisioning_Snippets_provisioning[Creating Custom Provisioning Snippets] in _{ProvisioningDocTitle}_.

* Pulp is introducing more data about container manifests to the API.
This information allows Katello to display manifest labels, annotations, and information about the manifest type, such as if it is bootable or represents flatpak content.
As a result, migrations must be performed to pull this content from manifests into the database.

ifdef::katello[]
This migration takes time, so if you depend on container content and need minimal upgrade downtime, run the following command on {ProjectServer} for a pre-migration:

[options="nowrap" subs="attributes"]
----
# foreman-maintain advanced procedure run pulpcore-container-handle-image-metadata
----
This command migrates data in the background without any need for downtime and reduces future upgrade downtime.
endif::[]

ifdef::satellite,orcharhino[]
This migration takes time, so a pre-migration runs automatically after the upgrade to {ProjectVersion} to reduce future upgrade downtime.
While the pre-migration is running, {ProjectServer} is fully functional but uses more hardware resources.

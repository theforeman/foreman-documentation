= Configuring Provisioning Callback for a Host

When you create hosts in {Project}, you can use {awx} to run playbooks to configure your newly created hosts. This is called _provisioning callback_ in {awx}.

The provisioning callback function triggers a playbook run from {awx} as part of the provisioning process. The playbook configures the host after Kickstart deployment.

For more information about provisioning callbacks, see http://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/userguide/job_templates.html#provisioning-callbacks[Provisioning Callbacks] in the _{awx} User Guide_.

In {ProjectServer}, the `Kickstart Default` and `Kickstart Default Finish` templates include three snippets:

. `ansible_provisioning_callback`
. `ansible_tower_callback_script`
. `ansible_tower_callback_service`

You can add parameters to hosts or host groups to provide the credentials that these snippets can use to run Ansible playbooks on your newly created hosts.

.Prerequisites

Before you can configure provisioning callbacks, you must add {Project} as a dynamic inventory in {awx}. For more information, see xref:chap-{Project_Link}-Managing_Hosts-Integrating_{Project}_and_Ansible_Tower[Integrating {Project} and {awx}].

In the {awx} web UI, you must complete the following tasks:

. Create a machine credential for your new host. Ensure that you enter the same password in the credential that you plan to assign to the host that you create in {Project}. For more information, see https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/userguide/credentials.html#add-a-new-credential[Add a New Credential] in the _{awx} User Guide_.
. Create a project. For more information, see https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/userguide/projects.html[Projects] in the _{awx} User Guide_.
. Add a job template to your project. For more information, see https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/userguide/job_templates.html#create-a-job-template[Job Templates] in the _{awx} User Guide_.
. In your job template, you must enable provisioning callbacks, generate the host configuration key, and note the _template_ID_ of your job template. For more information about job templates, see http://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/userguide/job_templates.html#[Job Templates] in the _{awx} User Guide_.

.Procedure

To configure provisioning callback for a new host in {Project}, complete the following steps:

. In the {ProjectName} web UI, navigate to *Configure* > *Host Group*.
. Create a host group or edit an existing host group.
. In the Host Group window, click the *Parameters* tab.
. Click *Add Parameter*.
. Enter the following information for each new parameter:

.Host Parameters
[cols="1a,1a,2a"options="header"]
|====
|Name |Value |Description
|`ansible_tower_provisioning` |true |Enables Provisioning Callback.
|`ansible_tower_fqdn` |_tower.example.com_ |The fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of your {awx}. Do not add `https` because this is appended by {awx}.
|`ansible_job_template_id` |_template_ID_ |The ID of your provisioning template that you can find in the URL of the template: `/templates/job_template/_5_`.
|`ansible_host_config_key` |_config_KEY_ |The host configuration key that your job template generates in {awx}.
|====
+
. Click *Submit*.
. Create a host using the host group.
. On the new host, enter the following command to start the `ansible-callback` service:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# systemctl start ansible-callback
----
+
. On the new host, enter the following command to output the status of the `ansible-callback` service:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# systemctl status ansible-callback
----
+
Provisioning callback is configured correctly if the command returns the following output:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
SAT_host systemd[1]: Started Provisioning callback to {awx}...
----

.Manual Provisioning Callback
You can use the provisioning callback URL and the host configuration key from a host to call {awx}. For example:
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# curl -k -s --data curl --insecure --data host_config_key=_my_config_key_ \
 https://_tower.example.com_/api/v2/job_templates/_8_/callback/
----

Ensure that you use `https` when you enter the provisioning callback URL.

This triggers the playbook run specified in the template against the host.

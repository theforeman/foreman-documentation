= Adding Proxmox Images to {ProjectServer}

Proxmox uses templates as images for creating new virtual machines.
When you use image-based provisioning to create new hosts, you need to add Proxmox template details to your {ProjectServer}.
This includes access details and the template name.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Infrastructure* > *Compute Resources*.
. Select your Proxmox compute resource.
. Click *Create Image*.
. In the *Name* field, enter a name for the image.
. From the *Operating System* list, select the base operating system of the image.
. From the *Architecture* list, select the operating system architecture.
. In the *Username* field, enter the SSH user name for image access.
By default, this is set to `root`.
This is only necessary if the image has an inbuilt user account.
. From the *User data* list, select whether you want the images to support user data input, such as `cloud-init` data.
. In the *Password* field, enter the SSH password for image access.
. In the *Image* field, enter the relative path and name of the template on the vSphere environment.
Do not include the data center in the relative path.
. Click *Submit* to save the image details.

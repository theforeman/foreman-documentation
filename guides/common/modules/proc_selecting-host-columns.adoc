= Selecting Host Columns

You can select what columns you want to see in the host table on the *Hosts* > *All Hosts* page.
Columns under the Reported Data category, such as Disk Space, BIOS vendor, and RAM, are populated based on available facts from the hostâ€™s configuration management or system inventory tools.
Subscription Manager does not report disk space by default.
To populate this data, the host must be configured to report facts through a tool that includes this information, such as Ansible or Puppet.
For a complete list of host columns, see xref:overview-of-the-host-columns_{context}[].

[NOTE]
====
It is not possible to deselect the *Name* column.
The *Name* column serves as a primary identification method of the host.

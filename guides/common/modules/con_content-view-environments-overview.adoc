By default, you can assign multiple content view environments to hosts and activation keys.
This is controlled by the *Allow multiple content views* setting.

Hosts registered with multiple activation keys handle content view environment assignments based on the order of activation keys and content view environments.
For more information, see xref:content-view-environment-ordering-and-priority[].

When you disable *Allow multiple content views*, multi-environment hosts remain assigned to multiple content view environments and retain access to all their content.
Existing multi-environment activation keys remain associated with multiple content view environments, and both multi-environment hosts and activation keys remain visible in the {ProjectWebUI} and accessible through the Hammer CLI.
However, registration fails if you attempt to assign a host to multiple content view environments or use a multi-environment activation key during host registration.
Assigning multiple content view environments to a host or activation key results in an error.

When you disable *Allow multiple content views*, you can still reassign a multi-environment host to a single content view environment.
You can also reassign a multi-environment activation key to a single content view environment or remove all content view environments from the key.

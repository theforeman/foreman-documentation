= Content view environments overview

The *Allow multiple content views* setting controls whether hosts and activation keys can be assigned to multiple content view environments.
By default, this feature is disabled, limiting assignments to a single content view environment.
Enable this setting to assign multiple content view environments to hosts and activation keys.
For more information on content settings, see {AdministeringDocURL}content_settings_{context}[Content settings] in _{AdministeringDocTitle}_.

Hosts registered with multiple activation keys handle content view environment assignments based on the key order and settings configuration.
For more information about content view environment ordering and priority, see xref:content-view-environment-ordering-and-priority[].

When you disable *Allow multiple content views*, multi-environment hosts remain assigned to multiple content view environments and retain access to all their content.
Existing multi-environment activation keys remain associated with multiple content view environments, and both multi-environment hosts and activation keys remain visible in the web UI and accessible through the Hammer CLI.
However, registration fails if you attempt to assign a host to multiple content view environments or use a multi-environment activation key during host registration.
Assigning multiple content view environments to a host or activation key results in an error.

When you disable *Allow multiple content views*, you can still reassign a multi-environment host to a single content view environment.
You can also reassign a multi-environment activation key to a single content view environment or remove all content view environments from the key.

This setting provides flexibility in managing how content view environments are applied to hosts and activation keys while ensuring consistent behavior when disabled.

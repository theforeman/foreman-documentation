[id="lifecycle-environments_{context}"]
= Lifecycle environments

Application lifecycles are divided into *lifecycle environments* which represent each stage of the application lifecycle.
Lifecycle environments are linked to form an *environment path*.
You can promote content along the environment path to the next lifecycle environment when required.
For example, if development ends on a particular version of an application, you can promote this version to the testing environment and start development on the next version.

= Calculating the maximum open files limit for qpidd

In deployments using `katello-agent` infrastructure with a large number of content hosts, it may be necessary to increase the maximum open files for qpidd.

Calculate the limit for open files in qpidd using this formula: `(N x 4) + 500`, where N is the number of content hosts.
A single content host can consume up to four file descriptors and 500 file descriptors are required for the operations of Broker (a component of qpidd).

.Procedure
. Set the maximum open files limit in `/etc/foreman-installer/custom-hiera.yaml`:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
qpid::open_file_limit: "_My_Value_"
----
+
The default value is `65536`.

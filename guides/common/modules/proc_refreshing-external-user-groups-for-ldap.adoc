= Refreshing External User Groups for LDAP

To set the LDAP source to synchronize user group membership automatically on user login, in the *Auth Source* page, select the *Usergroup Sync* option.
If this option is not selected, LDAP user groups are refreshed automatically through a scheduled cron job synchronizing the LDAP Authentication source every 30 minutes by default.

If the user groups in the LDAP Authentication source change in the lapse of time between scheduled tasks, the user can be assigned to incorrect external user groups.
This is corrected automatically when the scheduled task runs.

Use this procedure to refresh the LDAP source manually.

. On the *External Groups* tab, click *Refresh* to the right of the required user group.

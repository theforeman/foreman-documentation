= Attaching the {Project} Infrastructure Subscription

[NOTE]
====
Skip this step if you have SCA enabled on {Project}.
There is no requirement of attaching the {SatelliteSub} to the {ProjectServer} using subscription-manager.
====

After you have registered {ProductName}, you must identify your subscription Pool ID and attach an available subscription.
The {ProjectName} Infrastructure subscription provides access to the {ProjectName} and {RHEL} content.
For {RHEL} 7, it also provides access to Red{nbsp}Hat Software Collections (RHSCL).
This is the only subscription required.

{ProjectName} Infrastructure is included with all subscriptions that include Smart Management.
For more information, see https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3382781[{Project} Infrastructure Subscriptions MCT3718 MCT3719] in the _Red{nbsp}Hat Knowledgebase_.

Subscriptions are classified as available if they are not already attached to a system.
If you are unable to find an available {Project} subscription, see the Red{nbsp}Hat Knowledgebase solution https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2058823[How do I figure out which subscriptions have been consumed by clients registered under Red Hat Subscription Manager?] to run a script to see if another system is consuming your subscription.

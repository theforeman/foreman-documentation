= Attaching the Satellite Infrastructure Subscription

After you have registered {ProductName}, you must identify your subscription Pool ID and attach an available subscription. The Red Hat Satellite Infrastructure subscription provides access to the Red{nbsp}Hat Satellite, Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise Linux, and Red{nbsp}Hat Software Collections (RHSCL) content. This is the only subscription required.

Red Hat Satellite Infrastructure is included with all subscriptions that include Smart Management. For more information, see the Red{nbsp}Hat Knowledgebase solution https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3382781[Satellite Infrastructure Subscriptions MCT3718 MCT3719]. 

Subscriptions are classified as available if they are not already attached to a system. If you are unable to find an available Satellite subscription, see the Red{nbsp}Hat Knowledgebase solution https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2058823[How do I figure out which subscriptions have been consumed by clients registered under Red Hat Subscription Manager?] to run a script to see if your subscription is being consumed by another system.

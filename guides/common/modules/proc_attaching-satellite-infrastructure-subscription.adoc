After you have registered {ProductName}, you must identify your subscription Pool ID and attach an available subscription.
The {ProjectName} Infrastructure subscription provides access to the {ProjectName} and {RHEL} content.

{ProjectName} Infrastructure is included with all subscriptions that include Smart Management.
For more information, see https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3382781[{Project} Infrastructure Subscriptions MCT3718 MCT3719] in the _Red{nbsp}Hat Knowledgebase_.

Subscriptions are classified as available if they are not already attached to a system.
If you are unable to find an available {Project} subscription, see the Red{nbsp}Hat Knowledgebase solution https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2058823[How do I figure out which subscriptions have been consumed by clients registered under Red Hat Subscription Manager?] to run a script to see if another system is consuming your subscription.

= Installing a {ProjectServer}

Installing an instance of {ProjectServer} on a dedicated server is the first step to a working {Project} infrastructure.
ifdef::satellite[]
You can install a {ProjectServer} in a connected or disconnected setup:

* Connected deployment is suitable for networked environments where your {ProjectServer} is connected to the Red{nbsp}Hat CDN.
* Disconnected deployment is suitable for high-security environments where direct Internet access is restricted or prohibited.

A disconnected {ProjectServer} is isolated from Red{nbsp}Hat CDN but you can still provision systems with the latest security updates, errata, packages, and other content.
You can use the following methods to import content to a disconnected {ProjectServer}:

Content ISO::
In this setup, you download ISO images with content from the Red{nbsp}Hat Customer Portal and extract them to {ProjectServer} or a local web server.
The content on {ProjectServer} is then synchronized locally.
+
This allows for complete network isolation of {ProjectServer}, however, the release frequency of content ISO images is around six weeks and not all product content is included.

Disconnected {Project} with {ISS}::
In this setup, you install a connected {ProjectServer} and export content from it to populate a disconnected {Project} using a storage device.
+
This allows for exporting both Red{nbsp}Hat provided and custom content at the frequency you choose, but requires deploying an additional server with a separate subscription.

= Troubleshooting Discovery

If a machine is not listed in the {ProjectWebUI} in *Hosts* > *Discovered Hosts*, inspect the following configuration areas to help isolate the error:

* Ensure that the prerequisites are met.
For more information, see xref:prerequisites-for-using-discovery_{context}[].
* Ensure you have set Discovery for booting and built the PXE boot configuration files.
For more information, see xref:setting-discovery-as-the-default-PXE-boot-option_{context}[].
* Verify the following configuration files on the TFTP {SmartProxy}:
** `/var/lib/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/default`
** `/var/lib/tftpboot/grub2/grub.cfg`

+
The files must be present and they must have `discovery` as the default boot option.
* Ensure adequate network connectivity between hosts, {SmartProxyServer}, and {ProjectServer}.
* Check the PXE template in use and determine the PXE Discovery snippet it includes.
The default snippets are named as follows: `pxelinux_discovery`, `pxegrub_discovery`, or `pxegrub2_discovery`.
Verify the `proxy.url` and `proxy.type` options in the PXE Discovery snippet.
* Ensure that DNS is working correctly for the discovered hosts or use an IP address in the `proxy.url` option in the PXE Discovery snippet included in the PXE template you are using.
* Ensure that the DHCP server is delivering IP addresses to the booted Discovery image correctly.
* If the host boots into the Discovery image but Discovery is not successful, enable the root account and SSH access on the Discovery image.
You can enable SSH and set the root password by using the following Discovery kernel options:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,verbatim"]
----
fdi.ssh=1 fdi.rootpw=_My_Password_
----
+
For more information about changing the Discovery kernel options, see the following resources:

** xref:Customizing_the_Discovery_PXE_Boot_{context}[]
** xref:customizing-the-discovery-iso_{context}[]

* Use TTY2 or higher to log in to a Discovery-booted host.
The first virtual console on the Discovery-booted host is reserved for *systemd* logs.
Particularly useful system logs are tagged as follows:

** `discover-host` {endash} initial facts upload
** `foreman-discovery` {endash} facts refresh, reboot remote commands
** `nm-prepare` {endash} boot script which pre-configures NetworkManager
** `NetworkManager` {endash} networking information

+
For gathering important system facts, use the `discovery-debug` command on the Discovery-booted host.
It prints out system logs, network configuration, list of facts, and other information on the standard output.
You can redirect this output to a file and copy it with the `scp` command for further investigation.

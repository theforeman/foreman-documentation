= Troubleshooting Discovery

If a machine is not listed in the {ProjectWebUI} in *Hosts* > *Discovered Hosts*, it means that Discovery has failed.
Inspect the following configuration areas to help isolate the problem:

.Inspecting prerequisites
* Ensure that your {Project} and hosts meet the requirements.
For more information, see xref:prerequisites-for-using-discovery_{context}[].

.Inspecting problems on {Project}
* Ensure you have set Discovery for booting and built the PXE boot configuration files.
For more information, see xref:setting-discovery-as-the-default-PXE-boot-option_{context}[].
* Verify that these configuration files are present on your TFTP {SmartProxy} and have `discovery` set as the default boot option:
** `/var/lib/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/default`
** `/var/lib/tftpboot/grub2/grub.cfg`
* Verify that the values of the `proxy.url` and `proxy.type` options in the PXE Discovery snippet you are using.
The default snippets are named `pxelinux_discovery`, `pxegrub_discovery`, or `pxegrub2_discovery`.

.Inspecting problems with networking
* Ensure adequate network connectivity between hosts, {SmartProxyServer}, and {ProjectServer}.
* Ensure that the DHCP server provides IP addresses to the booted Discovery image correctly.
* Ensure that DNS is working correctly for the discovered hosts or use an IP address in the `proxy.url` option in the PXE Discovery snippet included in the PXE template you are using.

.Inspecting problems on the host
* If the host boots into the Discovery image but Discovery is not successful, enable the root account and SSH access on the Discovery image.
You can enable SSH and set the root password by using the following Discovery kernel options:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,verbatim"]
----
fdi.ssh=1 fdi.rootpw=_My_Password_
----
* Using TTY2 or higher, log in to a Discovery-booted host to review system logs.
For example, these logs are useful for troubleshooting:
`discover-host`:: Initial facts upload
`foreman-discovery`:: Facts refresh, reboot remote commands
`nm-prepare`:: Boot script which pre-configures NetworkManager
`NetworkManager`:: Networking information
* For gathering important system facts, use the `discovery-debug` command on the Discovery-booted host.
It prints out system logs, network configuration, list of facts, and other information on the standard output.
You can redirect this output to a file and copy it with the `scp` command for further investigation.

= Best practices for errata

* {Project} shows which errata are applicable for each content host by comparing package lists with installed and available packages.
* Use errata to add patches for security issues to a frozen set of content without unnecessarily updating other unaffected packages.
* Automate errata management by using a Hammer script or an {ansible-docs-url}[Ansible playbook].
* View errata on the content hosts page and compare between errata from the current content view and lifecycle environment and the _Library_ lifecycle environment, which contains the latest synchronized packages.
+
You can only apply errata included in the content view version of the lifecycle of your host.
You can view this as a recommendation to promote content views.

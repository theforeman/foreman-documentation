= Best practices for errata

* Use errata to add patches for security issues to a frozen set of content without unnecessarily updating other unaffected packages.
* Automate errata management by using a Hammer script or an {ansible-docs-url}[Ansible playbook].
* View errata on the content hosts page and compare the errata of the current content view and lifecycle environment to the Library lifecycle environment, which contains the latest synchronized packages.
+
You can only apply errata included in the content view version of the lifecycle of your host.
You can view applicable errata as a recommendation to create an incremental content view to provide errata to hosts.
For more information, see xref:Adding_Errata_To_An_Incremental_Content_View_{context}[].

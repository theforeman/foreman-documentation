= Prerequisites for using iPXE

You can use iPXE to boot virtual machines in the following cases:

* Your virtual machines run on a hypervisor that uses iPXE as primary firmware.
* Your virtual machines are in BIOS mode.
In this case, you can configure PXELinux to chainboot iPXE and boot by using the HTTP protocol.

For booting virtual machines in UEFI mode by using HTTP, you can follow xref:Creating_Hosts_with_UEFI_HTTP_Boot_Provisioning_{context}[] instead.

.BIOS and UEFI support
Only BIOS systems are known to work reliably.
For configuring iPXE with *some* EFI hosts, read a https://community.theforeman.org/t/discovery-ipxe-efi-workflow-in-foreman-1-20/13026[separate tutorial].

.Host requirements
* The MAC address of the provisioning interface matches the host configuration.
* The provisioning interface of the host has a valid DHCP reservation.
* The NIC is capable of PXE booting.
For more information, see https://ipxe.org/appnote/hardware_drivers[supported hardware on ipxe.org] for a list of hardware drivers expected to work with an iPXE-based boot disk.
* The NIC is compatible with iPXE.

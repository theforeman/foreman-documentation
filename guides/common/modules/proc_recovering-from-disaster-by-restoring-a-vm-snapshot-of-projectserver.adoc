[id="recovering-from-disaster-by-restoring-a-vm-snapshot-of-{project-context}-server"]
= Recovering from disaster by restoring a VM snapshot of {ProjectServer}

In case of a disaster, use a virtual machine (VM) snapshot of your {ProjectServer} to restore {Project} services.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Ensure that the hostname of your {ProjectServer} does not change during recovery.
The IP address can change.
====

.Procedure
. Identify the snapshot from which you want to recover.
. Use hypervisor tools to restore from the selected snapshot.
. If you are using an external database that runs on a different machine than your {ProjectServer}, ensure that you restore the database from a snapshot taken at the same time as or before the {ProjectServer} snapshot.
. Update DNS records so that the {ProjectServer} hostname resolves to the new IP address.
This redirects traffic from the old server to the new server and you will not need to re-register your hosts.

.Verification
* Assess the functionality of your restored {ProjectServer}.

= Deploying the MCP server for {Project}

[role="_abstract"]
Deploy the MCP server for {Project} as a container and make it accessible to your MCP client.

Perform these steps on the same system where your MCP client will run.

.Prerequisites
ifdef::satellite[]
* You are logged in to the registry.redhat.io container registry.
endif::[]
* The CA bundle for your {Project} is available on your system.
You can download it from `https://_{foreman-example-com}_/unattended/public/foreman_raw_ca`.

.Procedure
. Optional: Pull the latest version of the MCP container image from the registry:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
$ podman pull {mcp-server-image}
----
. Run the container:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
$ podman run --interactive --tty --publish 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 \
  --volume _Path_to_My_CA_Bundle_:/app/ca.pem:ro,Z \
  {mcp-server-image} \
  --foreman-url https://_{foreman-example-com}_
----
+
The options used in the command include the following:
+
`--publish`:: Maps port 8080 from inside the container to port 8080 on the host, binding the port to the localhost.
`--volume`:: Mounts your CA certificate bundle from the host machine to the default location (`ca.pem`) inside the container.
* `ro` makes the read-only mode inside the container
* `Z` relabels the file with a private, unshared label
`--_Path_to_My_CA_Bundle_`:: Specifies the location of the {Project} CA bundle on the system.
This is required to verify the connection to {Project}.

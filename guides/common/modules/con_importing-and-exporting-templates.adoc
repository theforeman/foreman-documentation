= Importing and exporting templates

You can import and export templates by using the {ProjectWebUI}, Hammer CLI, or {Project} API.
{Project} API calls use the role-based access control system, which enables the tasks to be executed as any user.
You can synchronize templates with a version control system, such as Git, or a local directory.

= Configuring Puma Workers

If you have enough CPUs, adding more workers adds more performance.
For example, we have compared {Project} setups with 8 and 16 CPUs.

|{Project} VM with 8 CPUs, 40 GiB RAM |{Project} VM with 16 CPUs, 40 GiB RAM
|`--foreman-foreman-service-puma-threads-min=16` |`--foreman-foreman-service-puma-threads-min=16`
|`--foreman-foreman-service-puma-threads-max=16` |`--foreman-foreman-service-puma-threads-max=16`
|`--foreman-foreman-service-puma-workers=`{2|4|8|16}` |`--foreman-foreman-service-puma-workers={2|4|8|16}`
|===

In 8 CPUs setup, changing the number of workers from 2 to 16, improved concurrent registration time by 36%.
In 16 CPU setup, the same change caused 55% improvement.

Adding more workers can also help with total registration concurrency {Project} can handle.
In our measurements, setups with 2 workers were able to handle up to 480 concurrent registrations, but adding more workers improved the situation.

.Manual tuning
You can set the number of workers to two and the number of threads to five:

----
# {foreman-installer} \
--foreman-foreman-service-puma-threads-max=5
--foreman-foreman-service-puma-threads-min=5 \
--foreman-foreman-service-puma-workers=2 \
----

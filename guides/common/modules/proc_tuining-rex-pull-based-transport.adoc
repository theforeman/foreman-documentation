= Tuining REX Pull-Based Transport

{Project} has a pull-based transport that has the features of REX but with a deployment model similar to katello-agent. 
This transport uses MQTT as its messaging protocol and includes an MQTT client running on each host.
The following procedure tunes the MQTT server (`mosquitto`) and increases the number of hosts connected to it on the {ProjectServer}:

.Procedure

. Enable pull-based remote execution on your {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer}:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-installer} --foreman-proxy-plugin-remote-execution-script-mode pull-mqtt
----
+
Note that your {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer} can only use one transport mode, either SSH or MQTT.
. To increase the default number of hosts accepted by the MQTT server, create the following system unit definition file and set its contents as specified in the below given example (this will allow the `mosquitto` service to handle ~5000 hosts):
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
cat >/etc/systemd/system/mosquitto.service.d/limits.conf <<__EOF__
[Service]
LimitNOFILE=5000
__EOF__
----
. Run the following commands to apply your changes:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# systemctl daemon-reload
# systemctl restart mosquitto.service

= Requirements for installation in an IPv4 network

The following requirements apply to installations in an IPv4 network:

* An IPv6 loopback must be configured on the base system.
The loopback is typically configured by default.
Do not disable it.
* Do not disable IPv6 in kernel by adding the `ipv6.disable=1` kernel parameter.

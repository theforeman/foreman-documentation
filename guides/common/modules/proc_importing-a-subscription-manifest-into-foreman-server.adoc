= Importing a Red{nbsp}Hat subscription manifest into {ProjectServer}

[role="_abstract"]
Import a Red{nbsp}Hat subscription manifest into {ProjectServer} so that you can enable and synchronize Red{nbsp}Hat repositories.

[NOTE]
====
Simple Content Access (SCA) is set on the organization, not the manifest.
Importing a manifest does not change your organization's Simple Content Access status.
====

Simple Content Access simplifies the subscription experience for administrators.

= Configuring {ProjectServer} with an HTTP Proxy

If your network uses an HTTP Proxy, you can configure {ProjectServer} to use an HTTP proxy for requests to the Red{nbsp}Hat Content Delivery Network (CDN) or another content source. Use the FQDN instead of the IP address where possible to avoid losing connectivity because of network changes.

The following procedure configures a proxy only for downloading content for {Project}.

.Authentication Methods

Only basic authentication is supported: add your user name and password information to the `--katello-proxy-url` option, or use the `--katello-proxy-username` and `--katello-proxy-password` options.

.To Configure {Project} with an HTTP Proxy

. Verify that the `*http_proxy*`, `*https_proxy*`, and `*no_proxy*` variables are not set.
+
[options="nowrap"]
----
# unset http_proxy
# unset https_proxy
# unset no_proxy
----

. Run `{foreman-installer}` with the HTTP proxy options.
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-installer} --scenario satellite \
--katello-proxy-url=http://__myproxy.example.com__ \
--katello-proxy-port=8080 \
--katello-proxy-username=__proxy_username__ \
--katello-proxy-password='__proxy_password__'

ifeval::["{Build}" == "satellite"]

. Verify that {ProjectServer} can connect to the Red{nbsp}Hat CDN and can synchronize its repositories.

.. On the network gateway and the HTTP Proxy, enable TCP for the following host names:
+
[cols="2,1,1",options="header"]
|====
| Host name | Port | Protocol
| subscription.rhsm.redhat.com | 443 | HTTPS
| cdn.redhat.com |  443 | HTTPS
| *.akamaiedge.net |  443 | HTTPS
| cert-api.access.redhat.com (if using Red{nbsp}Hat Insights) |  443 | HTTPS
| api.access.redhat.com (if using Red{nbsp}Hat Insights) |  443 | HTTPS
|====
+
{ProjectServer} communicates with the Red{nbsp}Hat CDN securely over SSL. Use of an SSL interception proxy interferes with this communication. These hosts must be whitelisted on the proxy.
+
For a list of IP addresses used by the Red{nbsp}Hat CDN (cdn.redhat.com), see the Knowledgebase article https://access.redhat.com/articles/1525183[Public CIDR Lists for Red{nbsp}Hat] on the Red{nbsp}Hat Customer Portal.
+
.. On {ProjectServer}, complete the following details in the `/etc/rhsm/rhsm.conf` file:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# an http proxy server to use (enter server FQDN)
proxy_hostname = _myproxy.example.com_

# port for http proxy server
proxy_port = 8080

# user name for authenticating to an http proxy, if needed
proxy_user =

# password for basic http proxy auth, if needed
proxy_password =
----
endif::[]

.SELinux Considerations for Custom Ports

SELinux ensures access of {ProjectNameX} and Red{nbsp}Hat Subscription Manager only to specific ports. In the case of the HTTP cache, the TCP ports are 8080, 8118, 8123, and 10001 - 10010. If you use a port that does not have SELinux type `http_cache_port_t`, complete the following steps:

. To verify the ports that are permitted by SELinux for the HTTP cache, enter a command as follows:
+
[options="nowrap",subs="+quotes"]
----
# semanage port -l | grep http_cache
http_cache_port_t       tcp    8080, 8118, 8123, 10001-10010
_[output truncated]_
----
+
. To configure SELinux to permit a port for the HTTP cache, for example 8088, enter a command as follows:
+
[options="nowrap",subs="+quotes"]
----
# semanage port -a -t http_cache_port_t -p tcp 8088

= Using an HTTP Proxy for all {Project} HTTP Requests

If your {ProjectServer} must remain behind a firewall that blocks HTTP and HTTPS, you can configure a proxy for communication with external systems, including compute resources.

Note that if you are using compute resources for provisioning, and you want to use a different HTTP proxy with the compute resources, the proxy that you set for all {Project} communication takes precedence over the proxies that you set for compute resources.

To set an HTTP proxy for all outgoing HTTP connections from {Project}, complete the following steps:

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Administer* > *Settings*.
. In the *HTTP(S) proxy* row, select the adjacent *Value* column and enter the proxy URL.
. Click the tick icon to save your changes.

.Excluding Hosts from Receiving Proxied Requests

If you use an HTTP Proxy for all {Project} HTTP or HTTPS requests, you can prevent certain hosts from communicating through the proxy.

To exclude one or more hosts from communicating through the proxy, complete the following steps:

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Administer* > *Settings*.
. In the *HTTP(S) proxy except hosts* row, select the adjacent *Value* column and enter the names of one or more hosts that you want to exclude from proxy requests.
. Click the tick icon to save your changes.


= Resetting the HTTP Proxy

If you want to reset the current HTTP proxy setting, enter the following command:

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-installer} --scenario satellite --reset-katello-proxy-url \
 --reset-katello-proxy-port --reset-katello-proxy-username \
 --reset-katello-proxy-password

Redis is a in-memory data store.
It is used by multiple services in {Project}.
Dynflow and Pulp tasking systems use it to track it's tasks.
Given the way {Project} uses the Redis, it's memory requirements should be stable.

We reccomend disabling Transparent Huge Pages on server running Redis.
For more about it please see xref:Disable_Transparent_Huge_Pages_{context}[].

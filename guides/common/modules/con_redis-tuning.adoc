= Redis tuning

Redis is an in-memory data store.
It is used by multiple services in {Project}.
The Dynflow and Pulp tasking systems use it to track their tasks.
Given the way {Project} uses Redis, its memory consumption should be stable.

The Redis authors recommend disabling Transparent Hugepage on servers running Redis.
For more about it please see xref:Disable_Transparent_Hugepage_{context}[].

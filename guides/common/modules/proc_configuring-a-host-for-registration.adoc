= Configuring a Host for Registration

{RHEL} virtual machines register to Customer Portal Subscription Management by default.
You must update each virtual machine configuration so that they receive updates from the correct {Project} Server or {SmartProxyServer}.

.Prerequisites
* Hosts must be using the following {EL} version:
** 6.4 or later
** 7.0 or later
* All architectures of {EL} are supported (i386, x86_64, s390x, ppc_64).
* Ensure that a time synchronization tool is enabled and runs on the {ProjectServer}s, any {SmartProxyServer}s, and the hosts.
** For {EL} 6:
+
----
# chkconfig ntpd on; service ntpd start
----
** For {EL} 7:
+
----
# systemctl enable chronyd; systemctl start chronyd
----
* Ensure that the daemon `rhsmcertd` is enabled and running on the hosts.
** For {EL} 6:
+
----
# chkconfig rhsmcertd on; service rhsmcertd start
----
** For {EL} 7:
+
----
# systemctl start rhsmcertd

.To Configure a Host for Registration:
. Take note of the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer}.
. On the host, connect to a terminal on the host as the root user
. Install the consumer RPM from {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer} to which the host is to be registered.
The consumer RPM updates the content source location of the host and allows the host to download content from the content source specified in {ProjectName}.

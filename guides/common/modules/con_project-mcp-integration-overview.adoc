= {Project} MCP integration overview

[role="_abstract"]
{Project} provides a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server so that users can use their preferred AI applications to obtain and process data about {Project} inventory.

{Team} provides a container image that you use to deploy an MCP server for {Project}.
On your system, you run an AI application, also known as MCP host.
Your AI application runs an MCP client.
The MCP client connects to your MCP server for {Project}.
The MCP server obtains the data about {Project} inventory by making API calls to your {ProjectServer} with SSL-encrypted HTTP requests.

[IMPORTANT]
====
For enhanced security, deploy the MCP server on the same system where the MCP client is running so that they can communicate over localhost.
Avoid deploying the MCP server on a system exposed to the network.

Each {Project} user deploys their own MCP server and uses their credentials to access the {Project} inventory data.
#A user's MCP client cannot obtain data that the user does not have permission to access.#

When the connection is established, you query your AI application for data about your {Project} environment.
The MCP client within the AI application obtains the required data from your {Project} inventory and returns it to the AI application.
The AI application processes the data to answer your queries.

The MCP server runs in read-only mode.
It does not make changes to your {Project} inventory.

= Puma Workers and Threads Recommendations

In order to recommend thread and worker configurations for the different tuning profiles, we conducted Puma tuning testing on {Project} with different tuning profiles and the main test run performed in this testing was concurrent registration with the following combinations along with different workers and threads.
Our recommendation is based purely on concurrent registration performance, so it might not reflect your exact use-case.
For example, if your setup is very content oriented with lots of publishes and promotes, you might want to limit resources consumed by Puma in favor of Pulp and PostgreSQL.

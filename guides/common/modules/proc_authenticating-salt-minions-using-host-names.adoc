= Authenticating Salt Minions using host names

Configure {Project} to authenticate Salt Minions based on their host names.
This relies on the `autosign.conf` file that stores the host names of Salt Minions the Salt Master accepts.

.Procedure
. On your Salt Master, add the `foreman-proxy` user that is running Salt to the `root` user group:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# usermod -a -G foreman-proxy root
----
. On your Salt Master, enable the `autosign.conf` file in `/etc/salt/master`:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="attributes"]
----
autosign_file: /etc/salt/autosign.conf
permissive_pki_access: True
----
. On your Salt Master, create the `/etc/salt/autosign.conf` file and set appropriate ownership and permissions:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="attributes"]
----
# touch /etc/salt/autosign.conf
# chown root:foreman-proxy /etc/salt/autosign.conf
# chmod 660 /etc/salt/autosign.conf
----

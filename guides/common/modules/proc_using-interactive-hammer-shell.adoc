= Using interactive Hammer shell

You can issue `hammer` commands through an interactive shell.
To start the shell, run the following command:

[options="nowrap", subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
$ hammer shell
----

In the shell, you can enter sub-commands directly without typing "hammer", which can be useful for testing commands before using them in a script.
To exit the shell, type `exit` or press *Ctrl* + *D*.

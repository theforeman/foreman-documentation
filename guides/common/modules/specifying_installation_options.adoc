= Specifying Installation Options

{ProjectServer} is installed using the `{foreman-installer}` installation script and as part of the initial configuration, you either automatically or manually configure {Project}.

Choose from one of these two methods:

 - Automatic Configuration - This method is performed by using an answer file to automate the configuration process when running the installation script. An answer file is a file containing a list of parameters that are read by a command or script. The default {Project} answer file is `/etc/foreman-installer/scenarios.d/satellite-answers.yaml`. The answer file in use is set by the `answer_file` directive in the `/etc/foreman-installer/scenarios.d/satellite.yaml` configuration file.
+
To perform the initial configuration using the installation script with an answer file, see xref:performing_initial_configuration_sat_server_answerfile[].
 - Manual Configuration - This method is performed by running the installation script with one or more command options. The command options override the corresponding default initial configuration options and are recorded in the {Project} answer file. You can run the script as often as needed to configure any necessary options.
+
To perform the initial configuration using the installation script with command-line options, see xref:performing_initial_configuration_sat_server_manual[].

NOTE: Depending on the options that you use when running the {Project} installer, the configuration can take several minutes to complete. An administrator is able to view the answer file to see previously used options for both methods.

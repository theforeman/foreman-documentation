= Package mode and image mode hosts

You can operate hosts in two modes: package mode and image mode.

{Project} identifies an image mode host as any system that reports a container image from its bootc status through `subscription-manager`. 
It classifies all other hosts as package mode hosts.

Image mode simplifies enterprise operations by enabling development, operations, and solution providers to use the same container-native tools and techniques to manage both applications and the underlying OS.

The distinction between package mode and image mode provides greater flexibility in managing hosts and streamlines operations for image-based deployments.

{Project} enables registration, monitoring, and update support for image mode hosts. 
Register image mode hosts like any other host, view their `bootc` statuses in a centralized location, and trigger updates remotely using remote execution. 
For more information on image mode concepts, refer to the https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/image-mode-red-hat-enterprise-linux-quick-start-guide[RHEL Image Mode quick start guide].

.Image mode hosts
Image mode hosts include additional fields that reflect their boot status.
These fields track the container images used in various scenarios:

* *Booted Image & Digest*: Indicates the container image the host is currently using.
* *Staged Image & Digest*: Indicates the container image the host uses after the next reboot.
* *Available Image & Digest*: Represents the container image cached by running `bootc upgrade --check`.
* *Rollback Image & Digest*: Represents the container image the host reverts to after the next reboot if `Bootc rollback` is applied.

{insights-iop} analyzes system health and configuration by applying predefined rules to a small set of local data, such as installed packages, running services, and configuration settings.
When you install {insights-iop} locally, you can generate {Insights} recommendations without sending system data to Red{nbsp}Hat services.

[IMPORTANT]
====
With {insights-iop} enabled, you cannot use the hosted {Insights} services for hosts registered to your {Project}.
Enabling {insights-iop} prevents you from using any Red{nbsp}Hat Hybrid Cloud Console services on the registered hosts.

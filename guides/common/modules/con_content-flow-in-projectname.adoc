= Content Flow in {ProjectName}

Content flow in {ProjectName} involves management and distribution of content from external sources to the managed systems.

Content in {Project} flows from _external content sources_ to _{ProjectServer}_.
_{SmartProxyServers}_ mirror the content to _managed hosts_.

*External content sources*::
You can configure many content sources with {Project}. The supported content sources include the Red{nbsp}Hat Customer Portal, Git repositories, Ansible collections, Docker Hub, Puppet Forge, SCAP repositories, or internal data stores of your organization.
*{ProjectServer}*::
On the {ProjectServer}, you plan and manage the content life cycle.
*{SmartProxyServers}*::
By creating {SmartProxyServers}, you can establish content sources in various geographical locations.
*Managed hosts*::
By assigning a host system to a {SmartProxyServer} or directly to your {ProjectServer}, you ensure the host receives the content they provide.
Hosts can be physical or virtual.

[id="opening-required-ports"]
= Opening required ports

By opening the required ports, you ensure that the components of {Project} architecture can communicate.
You must also ensure that the required network ports are open on any network-based firewalls.

[NOTE]
====
Some cloud solutions must be specifically configured to allow communications between machines because they isolate machines similarly to network-based firewalls.
If you use an application-based firewall, ensure that the application-based firewall permits all applications that are listed in the tables and known to your firewall.
If possible, disable the application checking and allow open port communication based on the protocol.

If you do not use `firewall-cmd` to configure the Linux firewall, implement using the command of your choice.

.Procedure
. Optional: If you need to prevent the DHCP {SmartProxy} from pinging hosts to check for available IP addresses, disable DHCP IP address pinging:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-installer} --foreman-proxy-dhcp-ping-free-ip false
----
+
By default, a DHCP {SmartProxy} performs ICMP ping and TCP echo connection attempts to hosts in subnets with DHCP IPAM set to find out if an IP address considered for use is free.

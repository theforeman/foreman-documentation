= Creating snapshots of a host

[role="_abstract"]
You can use the Snapshot Management plugin to create snapshots of hosts.

.Prerequisites
* You have installed the Snapshot Management plugin successfully.
For more information, see xref:Installing_the_Snapshot_Management_plugin_{context}[].
* Your host is running on VMware vSphere or Proxmox.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Hosts* > *All Hosts* and select a host.
. In the *Snapshots* card, click *Create Snapshot*.
. Enter a *Name*.
. Optional: Enter a *Description*.
. Optional: In the *Snapshot Mode* field, select *Memory* if you want to include the RAM in your snapshot or *Quiesce* if you want to ensure the full state of the VM is written to disk before creating the snapshot.
. Click *Submit* to create a snapshot.

[CAUTION]
====
Keeping more than three snapshots per host slows down the creation and rollback process.
Consider deleting older snapshots when creating new ones.

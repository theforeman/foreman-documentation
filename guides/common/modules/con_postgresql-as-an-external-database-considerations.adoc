= PostgreSQL as an External Database Considerations

Foreman, Katello, and Candlepin use the PostgreSQL database. If you want to use PostgreSQL as an external database, the following information can help you decide if this option is right for your {Project} configuration. {Project} supports PostgreSQL version 12.1.

.Advantages of External PostgreSQL:

* Increase in free memory and free CPU on {Project}
* Flexibility to set `shared_buffers` on the PostgreSQL database to a high number without the risk of interfering with other services on {Project}
* Flexibility to tune the PostgreSQL server's system without adversely affecting {Project} operations

.Disadvantages of External PostgreSQL

* Increase in deployment complexity that can make troubleshooting more difficult
* The external PostgreSQL server is an additional system to patch and maintain
* If either {Project} or the PostgreSQL database server suffers a hardware or storage failure, {Project} is not operational
* If there is latency between the {Project} server and database server, performance can suffer

If you suspect that the PostgreSQL database on your {Project} is causing performance problems, use the information in https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2780871[Satellite 6: How to enable postgres query logging to detect slow running queries] to determine if you have slow queries. Queries that take longer than one second are typically caused by performance issues with large installations, and moving to an external database might not help. If you have slow queries, contact Red Hat Support.

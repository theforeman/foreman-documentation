= Overriding Ansible Variables in {Project}

If you run Ansible roles in {Project}, you can use {Project} to override Ansible variables for those roles.

.Precedence in Overriding Variables

If you use an Ansible role to run a task as a user that is not the `Effective User`, there is a strict order of precedence for overriding Ansible variables. To ensure that the variable that you override follows the correct order of precedence, see https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_variables.html#ansible-variable-precedence[Variable precedence: Where should I put a variable?] in the _Ansible User Guide_.

.Prerequisite

You must have Ansible variables in {Project}.

To import Ansible variables, see xref:importing-Ansible-variables_{context}[]

To create Ansible variables, see xref:creating-Ansible-variables_{context}[]

The following procedure makes reference to hosts and host groups. For more information about hosts and host groups, see the {BaseURL}managing_hosts/[Managing Hosts] guide.

.Procedure

To override an Ansible variable, complete the following steps:

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Configure* > *Variables*.
. Select the Ansible variable that you want to override and manage with {Project}.
. Navigate to the *Default Behavior* area, and select the *Override* check box.
. From the *Parameter Type* select the value type for validation. For example, a *string* or *boolean* variable.
. In the *Default Value* field, enter the default value that you want to use if there is no match for the variable.
. Optional: If you do not want to display the Ansible variable in plain text, select the *Hidden Values* check box to display the content of the variable as asterisks in the {Project} web UI.
. To save the override settings, click *Submit*.

To use the Ansible variable, add the variable as a parameter to your host or host group, or add the variable as a global parameter.

.For a Host Group:

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Configure* > *Host Groups*, and select the host group that you want to use.
. Click the *Parameters* tab, and in the *Host Group Parameters* area, click *Add Parameter*.
. In the *Name* field, add the Ansible variable name.
. From the *Type* list, select the type of the variable for validation.
. In the *Value* field, enter the value for the variable.

.For a Host:

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Hosts* > *All Hosts*, and on the host that you want to use, click the *Edit* button.
. Click the *Parameters* tab, and in the *Host Parameters* area, click *Add Parameter*.
. In the *Name* field, add the Ansible variable name.
. From the *Type* list, select the type of the variable for validation.
. In the *Value* field, enter the value for the variable.

.To add as a Global Parameter:

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Configure* > *Global Parameters*, and click *Create Parameter*.
. In the *Name* field, add the Ansible variable name.
. From the *Type* list, select the type of the variable for validation.
. In the *Value* field, enter the value for the variable.
. Optional: If you do not want to display the Ansible variable in plain text, select the *Hidden Values* check box to display the content of the variable as asterisks in the {Project} web UI.

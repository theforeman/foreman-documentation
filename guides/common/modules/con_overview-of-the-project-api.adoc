= Overview of the {Project} API

[role="_abstract"]
The {Project} API offers several benefits and supports various use cases for integrating the API into your workflows.

The benefits of using the REST API are:

* Broad client support {endash} any programming language, framework, or system with support for HTTP protocol can use the API.
* Self-descriptive {endash} client applications require minimal knowledge of the {ProjectName} infrastructure because a user discovers many details at runtime.
* Resource-based model {endash} the resource-based REST model provides a natural way to manage a virtualization platform.

You can use the REST API to perform the following tasks:

* Integrate with enterprise IT systems.
* Integrate with third-party applications.
* Perform automated maintenance or error checking tasks.
* Automate repetitive tasks with scripts.

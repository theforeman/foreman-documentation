= PXE loaders

In {Project}, a PXE loader defines the `filename` DHCPv4 option to use during provisioning.

* For BIOS systems, select the *PXELinux BIOS* option to enable a provisioned host to download the `pxelinux.0` file over TFTP.
* For UEFI systems, select the *Grub2 UEFI* option to enable a TFTP client to download `grubx64.efi` file, or select the *Grub2 UEFI HTTP* option to enable an UEFI HTTP client to download `grubx64.efi` with the HTTP Boot feature.

{ProjectName} supports host provisioning with UEFI Secure Boot.
SecureBoot PXE loaders enable a client to download the `shimx64.efi` bootstrap boot loader that then loads the signed `grubx64.efi`.
Use the *Grub2 UEFI SecureBoot* PXE loader for PXE-boot provisioning.

Use the *Grub2 UEFI HTTPS SecureBoot* PXE loader for HTTP-boot provisioning.

By default, you can provision the same RHEL version as your {ProjectServer} on Secure Boot enabled hosts.
To provision other versions of {RHEL}, you have to provide signed shim and GRUB2 binaries of those RHEL versions.
endif::[]
ifndef::satellite[]
By default, you can provision operating systems from the vendor of the operating system of your {ProjectServer} on Secure Boot enabled hosts.
To provision operating systems on Secure Boot enabled hosts from different vendors, you have to provide signed shim and GRUB2 binaries provided by the vendor of your operating system.

Other PXE loaders like *PXELinux UEFI*, *Grub2 ELF* or *iPXE Chain*, require additional configuration.
These workflows are not documented.

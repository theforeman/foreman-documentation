= Uploading OSTree Content with Hammer CLI

In deployments in which the {ProjectServer} does not have internet access, you can upload OSTree image archives using Hammer CLI.

You can create images using the Image Builder or OSBuild tool.

You can also create an OSTree image archive by downloading a repository from an upstream URL, such as:

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# wget --no-parent -r _https://repos.example.com/ostree/repo_name/_
# tar --exclude="index.html" -cvf "_example_archive_repo_.tar" -C _repos.example.com/ostree_ "_repo_name_"
----

.Prerequisite
* You have an OSTree image archive ready and present on your file system.

.Procedure
. Connect to your {ProjectServer} using SSH.
. Upload your OSTree archive with the `hammer` command:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# hammer repository upload-content --id _repository_id_ \
--content-type ostree_ref \
--path _/path/to/image/file.tar_ \
--ostree-repository-name _example_repo_name_
----
+
The value of `--ostree-repository-name` must match the name of the OSTree repository in the archive.

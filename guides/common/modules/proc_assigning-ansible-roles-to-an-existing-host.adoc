= Assigning Ansible Roles to an Existing Host

You can use Ansible roles for remote management of {RHEL} versions 8, 7, and 6.9 or later.

.Prerequisites

* Ensure that you have configured and imported Ansible roles. 

.Procedure

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Hosts* > *All Hosts*.
. On the host you want to assign an Ansible role to, click *Edit*.
. Select the *Ansible Roles* tab, and in the *All items* list, search for the roles that you want to add.
. Select the roles that you want to add, and click the arrow icon to move the roles to the *Selected items* list.
. Click *Submit*.

After you assign Ansible roles to hosts, you can use Ansible for remote execution. For more information, see xref:ssh-keys-for-remote-execution-overview_{context}[].

.Overiding Parameter Variables

On the *Parameters* tab, click *Add Parameter* to add any parameter variables that you want to pass to job templates at run time. This includes all Ansible playbook parameters and host parameters that you want to associate with the host. To use a parameter variable with an Ansible job template, you must add a *Host Parameter*.

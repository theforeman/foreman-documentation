= Assigning Ansible Roles to an Existing Host

You can use Ansible roles for remote management of {RHEL} versions 8, 7, and 6.9 or later.

.Prerequisites

* Ensure that you have configured and imported Ansible roles.

. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Hosts > All Hosts*.
. Select the host and click *Edit*.
. On the *Ansible Roles* tab, select the role that you want to add from the *Available Ansible Roles*.
. Click the *+* icon to add the role to the *Assigned Ansible Roles* list.
You can add more than one role.
. Click *Submit*.
. If the host has Ansible roles assigned, you can add or remove roles by clicking the *Edit Ansible Roles* button.
. In the *Edit Ansible Roles* window select the roles you want to add and click the *>* button to add it.

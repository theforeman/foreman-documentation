= Using Report Templates to Monitor Hosts

You can use report templates to query {Project} data to obtain information about, for example, host status, registered hosts, applicable errata, applied errata, subscription details, and user activity.
You can use the report templates that ship with {Project} or write your own custom report templates to suit your requirements.
The reporting engine uses the embedded Ruby (ERB) syntax.
For more information about writing templates and ERB syntax, see xref:Template_Writing_Reference_{context}[].

You can create a template, or clone a template and edit the clone.
For help with the template syntax, click a template and click the *Help* tab.

= Using {Project} as a source of content for {LoraxCompose}

In {Project}, you can integrate with {Cockpit}.
By using {Cockpit}, you can access {LoraxCompose} and build images.
When you configure {LoraxCompose} for image building, you can use {Project} content to build the images.

For more information, see xref:Importing_Content_{context}[].

.Procedure

= Installing and configuring the Insights advisor engine in {Project}

The Insights advisor engine in {Project} helps {RHEL} systems perform efficiently, keeping them secure and available.

It analyzes system health and configuration by applying predefined rules to a small set of local data, such as installed packages, running services, and configuration settings. 
When you deploy the Insights advisor engine locally on {Project}, you can generate Insights recommendations without sending system data to {Team} services.

You can install and configure the Insights advisor engine on a disconnected {ProjectServer} by using either the {Project} installation ISO or a container image import and export.

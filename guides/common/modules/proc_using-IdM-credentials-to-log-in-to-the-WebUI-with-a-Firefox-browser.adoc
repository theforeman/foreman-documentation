This section describes how to use the Firefox browser to log in to your {ProjectWebUI} with your {FreeIPA} (IdM) login and password.

.Prerequisites
* You have enrolled your {ProjectServer} into {FreeIPA} and configured the server to use {FreeIPA} for authentication.
For more information, see {InstallingServerDocURL}Using_FreeIPA_{project-context}[Using {FreeIPA}] in _{InstallingServerDocTitle}_.
* The host on which you are using a Firefox browser to log in to the {ProjectWebUI} is an {FreeIPA} client.
* You have a valid {FreeIPA} login and password.
* {Team} recommends using the latest stable Firefox browser.
* Your Firefox browser is configured for Single Sign-On (SSO).

* An {FreeIPA} server is running and reachable by the host.

.Procedure
. Obtain the Kerberos ticket granting ticket (TGT) for yourself using your {FreeIPA} credentials:

[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
$ kinit _idm_user_
Password for idm_user@_EXAMPLE.COM_:
----
. In your browser address bar, enter the URL of your {ProjectServer}.

You are logged in automatically.

[NOTE]
====
Alternatively, you can skip the first two steps and enter your login and password in the fields displayed on the {ProjectWebUI}.
This is also the only option if the host from which you are accessing the {ProjectWebUI} is not an {FreeIPA} client.

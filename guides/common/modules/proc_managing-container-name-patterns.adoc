= Managing Container Name Patterns

When you use {Project} to create and manage your containers, as the container moves through Content View versions and different stages of the {Project} lifecycle environment, the container name changes at each stage.
For example, if you synchronize a container image with the name `ssh` from an upstream repository, when you add it to a {Project} product and organization and then publish as part of a Content View, the container image can have the following name: `my_organization_production-custom_spin-my_product-custom_ssh`.
This can create problems when you want to pull a container image because container registries can contain only one instance of a container name.
To avoid problems with {Project} naming conventions, you can set a registry name pattern to override the default name to ensure that your container name is clear for future use.

.Limitations

If you use a registry name pattern to manage container naming conventions, because registry naming patterns must generate globally unique names, you might experience naming conflict problems.
For example:

* If you set the `repository.docker_upstream_name` registry name pattern, you cannot publish or promote Content Views with container content with identical repository names to the `Production` lifecycle.
* If you set the `lifecycle_environment.name` registry name pattern, this can prevent the creation of a second container repository with the identical name.

You must proceed with caution when defining registry naming patterns for your containers.

.Procedure

To manage container naming with a registry name pattern, complete the following steps:

. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Content* > *Lifecycle* > *Lifecycle Environments*.
. Create a lifecycle environment or select an existing lifecycle environment to edit.
. In the *Container Image Registry* area, click the edit icon to the right of *Registry Name Pattern* area.
. Use the list of variables and examples to determine which registry name pattern you require.
. In the *Registry Name Pattern* field, enter the registry name pattern that you want to use.
For example, to use the `repository.docker_upstream_name`:
+
----
<%= repository.docker_upstream_name %>
----
+
. Click *Save*.

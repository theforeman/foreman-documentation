= Excluding hosts from rh-cloud and insights-client reports

You can set the `host_registration_insights` parameter to *False* to omit _rh-cloud_ and _insights-client_ reports.
{Project} will exclude the hosts from _rh-cloud_ reports and block _insights-client_ from uploading a report to the cloud.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Host* > *All Hosts*.
. Select any host for which you want to change the value.
. On the *Parameters* tab, click on the edit button of `host_registration_insights`.
. Set the value to *False*.

If you set the parameter to false on a host that is already reported on the https://console.redhat.com/[Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console], it will be still removed automatically from the inventory.
However, this process can take some time to complete.

.Additional resources
* You can set this parameter at any level.

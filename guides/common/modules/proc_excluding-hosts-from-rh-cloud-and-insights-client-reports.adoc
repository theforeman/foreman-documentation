= Excluding Hosts from rh-cloud and insights-client Reports

You can set the `host_registration_insights` parameter to *False* to omit _rh-cloud_ and _insights-client_ reports.
{Project} will exclude the hosts from _rh-cloud_ reports and block _insights-client_ from uploading a report to the cloud.

Use the following procedure to change the value of `host_registration_insights` parameter:

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Host* > *All Hosts*.
. Select any host for which you want to change the value.
. On the *Parameters* tab, click on the edit button of `host_registration_insights`.
. Set the value to *False*.

This parameter can also be set at the organization, hostgroup, subnet, and domain level.
Also, it automatically prevents new reports from being uploaded as long as they are associated with the entity.

If you set the parameter to false on a host that is already reported on the https://console.redhat.com/[Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console], it will be still removed automatically from the inventory.
However, this process can take some time to complete.

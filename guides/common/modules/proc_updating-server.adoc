.Procedure
ifdef::satellite[]
. Ensure the {Project} Maintenance repository is enabled:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="attributes"]
----
# subscription-manager repos --enable \
{RepoRHEL8ServerSatelliteMaintenanceProjectVersion}
----
endif::[]
. Check the available versions to confirm the next minor version is listed:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} upgrade list-versions
----
. Use the health check option to determine if the system is ready for upgrade.
On first use of this command, `{foreman-maintain}` prompts you to enter the hammer admin user credentials and saves them in the `/etc/foreman-maintain/foreman-maintain-hammer.yml` file.
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} upgrade check --target-version {ProjectVersion}.__z__
----
+
Review the results and address any highlighted error conditions before performing the upgrade.
. Because of the lengthy update time, use a utility such as `tmux` to suspend and reattach a communication session.
You can then check the upgrade progress without staying connected to the command shell continuously.
+
If you lose connection to the command shell where the upgrade command is running, you can see the logged messages in the `{installer-log-file}` file to check if the process completed successfully.
. Perform the upgrade:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} upgrade run --target-version {ProjectVersion}.__z__
----

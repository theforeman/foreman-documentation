= Managing Compliance Policies

A _compliance policy_ is a scheduled audit that checks the specified hosts for compliance against a specific XCCDF profile from a SCAP content.

You specify the schedule for scans on {ProjectServer} and the scans are performed on hosts.
When a scan completes, a report in ARF format is generated and uploaded to {ProjectServer}.
No changes are made to the scanned host by the compliance policy.

A compliance policy defines a SCAP client configuration and a Cron schedule that are then deployed together with the SCAP client on hosts to which the policy is assigned.

= Configuring {Project} for UEFI HTTP boot provisioning in an IPv6 network

[role="_abstract"]
Use this procedure to configure {Project} to provision hosts in an IPv6 network with UEFI HTTP Boot provisioning.

.Prerequisites
* Ensure that your clients can access DHCP and HTTP servers.
* Ensure that the UDP ports 67 and 68 are accessible by clients so clients can send DHCP requests and receive DHCP offers.
* Ensure that the TCP port 8000 is open for clients to download files and Kickstart templates from {Project} and {SmartProxies}.
* Ensure that the host provisioning interface subnet has an HTTP Boot {SmartProxy}, and Templates {SmartProxy} set.
For more information, see {ProvisioningDocURL}adding-a-subnet-to-server-by-using-web-ui[Adding a subnet to {ProjectServer} by using {ProjectWebUI}] in _{ProvisioningDocTitle}_.
* In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Administer* > *Settings* > *Provisioning* and ensure that the *Token duration* setting is not set to *0*.
{Project} cannot identify clients that are booting from the network by a remote IPv6 address because of unmanaged DHCPv6 service, therefore provisioning tokens must be enabled.

.Procedure
. You must disable DHCP management in the installer or not use it.
. For all IPv6 subnets created in {Project}, set the *DHCP {SmartProxy}* to blank.
. Optional: If the host and the DHCP server are separated by a router, configure the DHCP relay agent and point to the DHCP server.

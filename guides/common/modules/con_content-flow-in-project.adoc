= Content flow in {ProjectName}

Content flow in {ProjectName} involves management and distribution of content from external sources to hosts.

Content in {Project} flows from _external content sources_ to _{ProjectServer}_.
_{SmartProxyServers}_ mirror the content from {ProjectServer} to _hosts_.

External content sources::
You can configure many content sources with {Project}.
The supported content sources include the Red{nbsp}Hat Customer Portal, Git repositories, Ansible collections, Docker Hub, SCAP repositories, or internal data stores of your organization.
*{ProjectServer}*::
On your {ProjectServer}, you plan and manage the content lifecycle.
*{SmartProxyServers}*::
By creating {SmartProxyServers}, you can establish content sources in various locations based on your needs.
For example, you can establish a content source for each geographical location or multiple content sources for a data center with separate networks.
*Hosts*::
By assigning a host system to a {SmartProxyServer} or directly to your {ProjectServer}, you ensure the host receives the content they provide.
Hosts can be physical or virtual.

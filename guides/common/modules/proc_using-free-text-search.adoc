= Using Free Text Search

When you enter free text, it will be searched for across multiple fields.
For example, if you type "64", the search will return all hosts that have that number in their name, IP address, MAC address, and architecture.

[NOTE]
====
Multi-word queries must be enclosed in quotes, otherwise the whitespace is interpreted as the AND operator.
====

Because of searching across all fields, free text search results are not very accurate and searching can be slow, especially on a large number of hosts.
For this reason, we recommend that you avoid free text and use more specific, syntax-based queries whenever possible.

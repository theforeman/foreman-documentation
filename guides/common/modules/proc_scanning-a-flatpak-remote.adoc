= Scanning a Flatpak remote

You can scan a Flatpak remote to fetch metadata about the repositories it provides.
Scanning a Flatpak remote creates remote repository artifacts for the repositories hosted by the Flatpak remote. 
If new repositories are added to the Flatpak remote, scan it again to pull in the changes.

.Prerequisites
 * Your {Project} account has a role that grants the permissions `view_flatpak_remotes`, `create_flatpak_remotes`, `edit_flatpak_remotes`, and `destroy_flatpak_remotes`. 

* Set up Flatpak. 
For more information, see {RHELDocsBaseURL}9/html/administering_the_system_using_the_gnome_desktop_environment/assembly_installing-applications-using-flatpak_administering-the-system-using-the-gnome-desktop-environment#setting-up-flatpak_assembly_installing-applications-using-flatpak[Setting up Flatpak].

* Flatpak applications rely on Flatpak runtimes. 
For example, `rhel9/firefox-flatpak` depends on `rhel9/flatpak-runtime`. 
* Ensure that runtime repositories are available to clients alongside application repositories for installations to work.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Content* > *Flatpak Remotes*.
. Select the Flatpak remote that you want to scan.
. Click the vertical ellipsis next to the remote and select *Scan*.

= Puma Workers and Threads Auto-Tuning

If you do not provide any Puma workers and thread values with `{foreman-installer}` or they are not present in your {Project} configuration, the `{foreman-installer}` configures a balanced number of workers.
It follows this formula:

----
min(CPU*1.5, RAM_IN_GB - 1.5)
----

This is too much with regards to memory.
There have been cases where too many workers triggered OOM on {Project}.

This should be fine for most cases, but with some usage patterns tuning is needed to either limit the amount of resources dedicated to Puma (so other {Project} components can use these) or for any other reason.
Each Puma worker consumes around 1 GiB of RAM.

You can view your current {ProjectServer} settings as follows:

----
# cat /etc/systemd/system/foreman.service.d/installer.conf
[Service]
User=foreman
Environment=FOREMAN_ENV=production
Environment=FOREMAN_HOME=/usr/share/foreman
Environment=FOREMAN_PUMA_THREADS_MIN=5
Environment=FOREMAN_PUMA_THREADS_MAX=5
Environment=FOREMAN_PUMA_WORKERS=30
# pgrep -u foreman --list-full | grep 'puma: cluster worker'
----

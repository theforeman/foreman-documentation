= Puma Workers and Threads Auto-Tuning

If you do not provide any Puma workers and thread values with `{foreman-installer}` or they are not present in your {Project} configuration, the `{foreman-installer}` configures a balanced number of workers.
It follows this formula:

----
min(CPU_COUNT * 1.5, RAM_IN_GB - 1.5)
----

This should be fine for most cases, but with some usage patterns tuning is needed to either limit the amount of resources dedicated to Puma (so other {Project} components can use these) or for any other reason.
Each Puma worker consumes around 1 GiB of RAM.

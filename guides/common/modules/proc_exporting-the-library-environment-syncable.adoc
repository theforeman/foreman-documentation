= Exporting the Library Environment in a Syncable Format

You can export contents of all Yum repositories in the Library environment of an organization to a syncabe format that you can use to create your custom CDN and synchronize the content from the custom CDN over HTTP/HTTPS.

ifdef::satellite[]
You can then serve the generated content via a local webserver on the importing  {ProjectServer} or in another {ProjectServer} organization.

You cannot directly import Syncable Format exports. Instead on the importing {ProjectServer} you would need to
* Copy the generated content to an HTTP/HTTPS webserver that is accessible to importing {ProjectServer}
* Update your CDN configuration to *Custom CDN*
* Set the CDN URL to point to the web server
* Optionally set a SSL CA Credential if the web server requires it
* Enable the Repository
* Synchronize the Repository.
endif::[]

ifndef::satellite[]
You can use the generated content to create the same repositories in another {ProjectServer} or in another {ProjectServer} organization via content import.
On import the products and repositories are mirrored on your downstream {ProjectServer}.
endif::[]


You can export the following content in a syncable format from {ProjectServer}:
* RPM repositories
* Kickstart repositories
* File repositories
You cannot export Ansible and Docker content.

ifndef::satellite[]
You cannot export DEB repositories
endif::[]

The export contains the following data:

* Directories containing the rpms, *listing* files and metadata of each repository in yum format that could then be used synchronize in the importing {ProjectServer}.

.Prerequisites

To export the contents of the Library lifecycle environment of the organization, ensure that {ProjectServer} where you want to export meets the following conditions:

* Ensure that you set download policy to *Immediate* for all repositories within the Library lifecycle environment you export.
For more information, see xref:Download_Policies_Overview_{context}[].
* Ensure that you synchronize Products that you export to the required date.
* Ensure that the user exporting the content has the `Content Exporter` role.

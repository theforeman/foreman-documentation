= HTTP booting

The term HTTP booting refers to two booting stages: UEFI HTTP Boot and Boot Loader HTTP Boot.

UEFI HTTP booting is the process of fetching the Network Bootstrap Program (NBP) by the UEFI firmware over HTTP(S).
The NBP is typically the boot loader such as GRUB2.

Boot loader HTTP booting is the process of fetching installation files such as kernel and initrd by the boot loader over HTTP(S).

In HTTP boot, files are transferred over HTTP instead of TFTP.
Using this method can help reduce the booting time during host provisioning.
HTTP is also more reliable for the transfer of large files, such as Live images, than TFTP.

You can combine them independently of each other, although your host must meet certain conditions for UEFI HTTP Boot.
Boot loader HTTP Boot stage follows after UEFI HTTP Boot stage.

= Nested host groups

You can create a hierarchy of host groups.
Aim to have one base level host group that represents all hosts in your organization and provides general settings, and then nested groups that provide specific settings.

{Project} applies host settings in the following order when nesting host groups:

* Host settings take priority over host group settings.
* Nested host group settings take priority over parent host group settings.

.Nested host group hierarchy
====
You create a top-level host group named *Base* and two nested host groups named *Webserver* and *Storage*.
The nested host groups are associated with multiple hosts.
You also create host `custom.example.com` that is not associated with any host group.

You define the operating system on the top-level host group (*Base*) and Ansible roles on the nested host groups (*Webservers* and *Storage*).

|Top-level host group |Nested host group |Hosts |Settings inherited from host groups

.4+|*Base*

This host group applies the `{client-os}{nbsp}{client-os-major}.{client-os-minor}` operating system setting.

// Rows related to Webservers
.2+|*Webservers*

This host group applies the `linux-system-roles.selinux` Ansible role.

|*webserver1.example.com*

.2+a|Hosts use the following settings:

* `{client-os}{nbsp}{client-os-major}.{client-os-minor}` defined by host group *Base*
* `linux-system-roles.selinux` defined by host group *Webservers*

|*webserver2.example.com*

// Rows related to Storage
.2+|*Storage*

This host group applies the `linux-system-roles.postfix` Ansible role.

|*storage1.example.com*

.2+a|Hosts use the following settings:

* `{client-os}{nbsp}{client-os-major}.{client-os-minor}` defined by host group *Base*
* `linux-system-roles.postfix` defined by host group *Storage*

|*storage2.example.com*

// Row related to No host group
2+|[No host group]

|*custom.example.com*

|No settings inherited from host groups.

.Nested host group settings
====
You create a top-level host group named *Base* and two nested host groups named *Webserver* and *Storage*.
You also create host `custom.example.com` that is associated with the top-level host group *Base*, but no nested host group.

You define different values for the operating system and Ansible role settings on the top-level host group (*Base*) and nested host groups (*Webserver* and *Storage*).

= Viewing Salt Autosign Keys

The Salt Keys page lists hosts and their Salt keys.
You can manually accept, reject, or delete keys.

Use the Salt Autosign feature to automatically accept signing requests from managed hosts.
By default, managed hosts are supplied with a Salt key during host provisioning.

[NOTE]
====
This feature only covers the Salt Autosign using the `autosign.conf` authentication.

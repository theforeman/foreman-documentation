= Compliance Policy Dashboard

The compliance policy dashboard provides a statistical summary of compliance of hosts and the ability to view details for each host within the scope of that policy.
For all hosts which were evaluated as non-compliant, the `Failed` statistic provides a useful metric for prioritizing compliance effort.
The hosts detected as `Never audited` should also be a priority, since their status is unknown.

= Managing users and roles

[role="_abstract"]
A User defines a set of details for individuals who use the system.
Users can be associated with organizations and environments, so that when they create new entities, the default settings are automatically used.
Users can also have one or more _roles_ attached, which grants them rights to view and manage organizations and environments.

= Managing Users and Roles

A User defines a set of details for individuals using the system.
Users can be associated with organizations and environments, so that when they create new entities, the default settings are automatically used.
Users can also have one or more _roles_ attached, which grants them rights to view and manage organizations and environments.
See xref:Managing_Users_{context}[] for more information on working with users.

You can manage permissions of several users at once by organizing them into user groups.
User groups themselves can be further grouped to create a hierarchy of permissions.
For more information on creating user groups, see xref:Creating_and_Managing_User_Groups_{context}[].

Roles define a set of permissions and access levels.
Each role contains one on more _permission filters_ that specify the actions allowed for the role.
Actions are grouped according to the _Resource type_.
Once a role has been created, users and user groups can be associated with that role.
This way, you can assign the same set of permissions to large groups of users.
{Project} provides a set of predefined roles and also enables creating custom roles and permission filters as described in xref:Creating_and_Managing_Roles_{context}[].

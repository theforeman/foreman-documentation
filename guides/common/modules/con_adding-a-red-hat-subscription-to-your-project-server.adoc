= Adding a Red{nbsp}Hat subscription to your {ProjectServer}

A Red{nbsp}Hat Subscription Manifest is a set of encrypted files that contains your subscription information.
{ProjectServer} uses this information to access the CDN and find what repositories are available for the associated subscription.

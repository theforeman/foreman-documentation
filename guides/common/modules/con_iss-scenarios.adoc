* If you want to copy some but not all content from your {ProjectServer} to other {ProjectServer}s.
For example, you have Content Views that your IT department consumes content from {ProjectServer}, and you want to copy content from those Content Views to other {ProjectServer}s.
* If you want to copy all library content from your {ProjectServer} to another {ProjectServer}s.
For example, you have Products and repositories that your IT department consumes content from {ProjectServer} in the Library, and you want to copy all Products and repositories in that organization to another {ProjectServer}s.
* If you have both connected and disconnected {ProjectServer}s, and want to copy content from the connected servers to the disconnected servers.
For example, you require complete isolation of your management infrastructure for security or other purposes.

These scenarios require at least two {ProjectServer}s: one {ProjectServer} that is connected to the outside world and contains content to export, and another {ProjectServer} that is disconnected that you want to import content to.

You cannot use ISS to synchronize content from {ProjectServer} to {SmartProxyServer}.
{SmartProxyServer} supports synchronization natively.

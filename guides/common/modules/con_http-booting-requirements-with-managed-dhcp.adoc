= HTTP booting requirements with managed DHCP

To provision machines through HTTP booting ensure that you meet the following requirements:

.Client requirements
For HTTP booting to work, ensure that your environment has the following client-side configurations:

* All the network-based firewalls are configured to allow clients on the subnet to access the {SmartProxy}.
For more information, see xref:common/modules/con_networking-considerations-in-project.adoc#networking-considerations-in-{project-context}[].
* Your client has access to the DHCP and DNS servers.
* Your client has access to the HTTP UEFI Boot {SmartProxy}.

.Network requirements
* Optional: If the host and the DHCP server are separated by a router, configure the DHCP relay agent and point to the DHCP server.

.{Project} requirements
Although TFTP protocol is not used for HTTP UEFI Booting, {Project} uses TFTP {SmartProxy} API to deploy boot loader configuration.

For HTTP booting to work, ensure that {Project} has the following configurations:

* Both {ProjectServer} and {SmartProxy} have DNS configured and are able to resolve provisioned host names.
* The UDP ports 67 and 68 are accessible by the client so that the client can send and receive a DHCP request and offer.
* Ensure that the TCP port 8000 is open for the client to download the boot loader and Kickstart templates from the {SmartProxy}.
* The TCP port {smartproxy_port} is open for the client to download the boot loader from the {SmartProxy} using the HTTPS protocol.
* The subnet that functions as the host's provisioning interface has a DHCP {SmartProxy}, an HTTP Boot {SmartProxy}, a TFTP {SmartProxy}, and a Templates {SmartProxy}

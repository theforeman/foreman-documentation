.Prerequisites

.Procedure

. Use the instructions in {InstallingProjectDocURL}attaching-satellite-infrastructure-subscription_{project-context}[Attaching the {Project} Infrastructure Subscription] to attach a {Project} subscription to your server.

. Disable all repositories and enable only the following repositories:

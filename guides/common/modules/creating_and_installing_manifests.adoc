. Navigate to *Subscriptions* in the upper-left corner of the Customer Portal.

. Navigate to *Subscription Allocations*.

. Click *Create New subscription allocation*.

. In the *Name* field, enter a name.

. From the *Type* list, select the type and version that corresponds to your {ProjectServer}.

. Click *Create*.

== Adding Subscriptions to an Allocation

The following procedure explains how to add subscriptions to an allocation.

. Open https://access.redhat.com/ in your browser and log in to the Red{nbsp}Hat account that you used to register the system to Red{nbsp}Hat Subscription Management.

. Navigate to *Subscriptions* in the upper-left corner of the Customer Portal.

. Navigate to *Subscription Allocations*.

. Click the allocation that you want to update.

. Click the *Subscriptions* tab.

[[Managing_Subscriptions-Exporting_a_Subscription_Manifest_from_the_Customer_Portal]]
== Exporting a Subscription Manifest from the Customer Portal

While viewing a subscription allocation that has at least one subscription, you can export a manifest in either of two places:

* From the *Details* tab, under the *Subscription* section, by clicking the *Export Manifest* button.
* From the *Subscriptions* tab, by clicking the *Export Manifest* button.

When the manifest is exported, the Customer Portal encodes the selected subscriptions certificates and creates a .zip archive. This is the Subscription Manifest, which can be uploaded into the {ProjectServer}.

[[Managing_Subscriptions-Importing_a_Subscription_Manifest_into_the_Satellite_6_Server]]
== Importing a Subscription Manifest into the {ProjectServer}

Both the {ProjectNameX} web UI and CLI provide methods for importing the manifest.

ifeval::["{mode}" == "disconnected"]

.Prerequisites

* Ensure that you enable the disconnected mode on your {ProjectServer}. For more information, see xref:enabling-the-disconnected-mode[].

endif::[]

.For Web UI Users

. Ensure the context is set to the organization you want to use.

. Navigate to *Content* > *Subscriptions*.

. Click *Manage Manifest* to display the manifest page for the organization.

. Click *Choose file*, select the Subscription Manifest, then click *Upload*.
. Click *Choose file* and select the manifest archive in a `.zip` format that you have exported from the Customer Portal.

.For CLI Users

The {ProjectNameX} CLI requires the manifest to be on the {ProjectServer}. On your local client system, copy the manifest to the {ProjectServer}:

[subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
[user@client ~]$ scp ~/_manifest_file_.zip root@{foreman-example-com}:~/.
----

Then import it using the following command:

[subs="+quotes"]
----
[root@satellite ~]# hammer subscription upload \
--file ~/_manifest_file_.zip \
--organization "_organization_name_"
----

After a few minutes, the CLI reports a successful manifest import.



When you complete this section, you can enable repositories and import Red Hat content. This is a prerequisite for some of the following procedures.

= Security Compliance Management

Security compliance management is the ongoing process of defining security policies, auditing systems for compliance with those policies, and resolving instances of non-compliance.
Any non-compliance is managed according to the organization's configuration management policies.
Security policies range in scope from host-specific to industry-wide, therefore, flexibility in their definition is required.

With {Project}, you can schedule compliance auditing and reporting on all registered hosts.

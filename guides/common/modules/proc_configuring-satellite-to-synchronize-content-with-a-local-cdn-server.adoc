= Configuring {Project} to Synchronize Content with a Local CDN Server

In a disconnected environment, you must ensure that {ProjectServer} contains the required content to provision systems with the latest security updates, errata, and packages.
To do this, follow this procedure to download content ISO images from the Red{nbsp}Hat Customer Portal and import them into a local CDN server.
You can host the local CDN server on the base operating system of {ProjectServer} or on a system that is accessible to {Project} over HTTP.
Next, you must configure {ProjectServer} to synchronize content with the local CDN server.

.Procedure
. Log on to the Red{nbsp}Hat Customer Portal at https://access.redhat.com.
. In the upper left of the window, click *Downloads* and select *{ProjectName}*.
. Click the *Content ISOs* tab.
This page lists all the products that are available in your subscription.
. Click the link for the product name, such as *{RHEL} 7 Server (x86_64)* to download the ISO image.
. Copy all of {Project} Content ISO images to a system that you want to use as a local CDN server.
For example, the `/root/isos` directory on {ProjectServer}.
+
Note that storing the content on the same system where {Project} is installed is not a requirement.
The CDN can be hosted on a different system inside the same disconnected network as long as it is accessible to {ProjectServer} over HTTP.
. On the system that you want to use as your local CDN server, create a local directory that is accessible over httpd.
For example, `/var/www/html/pub/sat-import/`:
+
----
# mkdir -p /var/www/html/pub/sat-import/
----
. Create a mount point and temporarily mount the ISO image at that location:
+
----
# mkdir /mnt/iso
# mount -o loop /root/isos/first_iso /mnt/iso
----
. Recursively copy content of the first ISO image to the local directory:
+
----
# cp -ruv /mnt/iso/* /var/www/html/pub/sat-import/
----
. If you do not plan to use the mounted binary DVD ISO image, unmount and remove the mount point:
+
----
# umount /mnt/iso
# rmdir /mnt/iso
----
. Repeat the above step for each ISO image until you have copied all the data from the Content ISO images into `/var/www/html/pub/sat-import/`.
. Ensure that the SELinux context for the directory is correct:
+
----
# restorecon -rv /var/www/html/pub/sat-import/
----
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Content* > *Subscriptions*.
. Click *Manage Manifest*.
. Edit the *Red Hat CDN URL* field to point to the host name of the system that you use as a local CDN server with the newly created directory, for example:
+
`\http://server.example.com/pub/sat-import/`
. Click *Update* and then upload your manifest into {Project}.

= Application centric deployment usage example

The following application centric deployment example illustrates the deployment of hosts in an application centric approach.
The web application requires an HAProxy, an Apache web server, a Tomcat application server, and a database server.

Using ACD, this web application can be deployed and configured in a single step:

. Import the Ansible Playbook
+
Upload the Ansible Playbook to your {ProjectServer}.
Specify the path and the name of the Ansible Playbook using the {ProjectWebUI}.
. Create an application definition
+
This example requires four different services: proxy servers, web servers, application servers, and database servers.
Those hosts are ideally part of a host group.
. Optional: Customize Ansible variables
+
You can either use the default values, change values, or lock the Ansible variables from being edited for an application instance.
Ansible variables are read from the group variables of the Ansible Playbook.
. Optional: Overwrite variables from the host group
+
For example, change the compute profile or set a different lifecycle environment.
. Deploy an application instance
+
You may simply deploy the application instance; run the Ansible Playbook as is; or customize the Ansible Playbook before running it.

[NOTE]
====
If you want to install a package using an Ansible Playbook and the host is subscribed to {ProjectServer}, ensure that the package exists in the content view.

= Copying a content view by using Hammer CLI

[role="_abstract"]
You can copy an existing content view into a new content view by using Hammer CLI.

[NOTE]
====
A copied content view does not have the same history as the original content view.
Version 1 of the copied content view begins at the last version of the original content view.
As a result, you cannot promote an older version of a content view from the copied content view.

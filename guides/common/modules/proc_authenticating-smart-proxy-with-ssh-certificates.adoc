= Authenticating {SmartProxy} with SSH certificates

[role="_abstract"]
You can configure {SmartProxy} to authenticate with an SSH certificate signed by a Certificate Authority (CA).
When enabled, {SmartProxy} presents a signed certificate to hosts instead of a plain SSH public key.

[WARNING]
====
After enabling this feature, SSH certificate authentication works on all newly registered or provisioned hosts.
Existing hosts will continue to trust plain SSH keys of the {SmartProxy} until you configure those hosts to trust the CA.
To configure existing hosts to accept the SSH certificate from the {SmartProxy}, complete xref:configuring-registered-hosts-to-accept-ssh-certificate-from-{smart-proxy-context}[].
====

.Prerequisites
* You have a CA for signing SSH certificates.

.Procedure
. On the {SmartProxyServer}, locate the SSH key pair that {SmartProxy} uses for remote execution.
You can find the private key location in `/etc/foreman-proxy/settings.d/remote_execution_ssh.yml` under the `:ssh_identity_key_file:` setting.
By default, the location is `/var/lib/foreman-proxy/ssh/id_rsa_foreman_proxy`.
. If the CA is on a different server than your {SmartProxyServer}, import the public key of the {SmartProxy} to the CA server.
. Sign the {SmartProxy} SSH public key with your CA.
+
The certificate name must be `__My_{smart-proxy-context-titlecase}_Private_Key__-cert.pub`.
By default, the created SSH certificate will have the name `id_rsa_foreman_proxy-cert.pub`.
. If the CA is on a different server than your {SmartProxyServer}, ensure the {SmartProxyServer} has the SSH certificate and the CA public key file:
.. Import the created SSH certificate back to the {SmartProxyServer} into the same directory as the original SSH key pair.
.. Import the CA public key file to the {SmartProxyServer}.
. Ensure that the `foreman-proxy` user has read access to the CA public key file.
. Enable SSH certificate authentication on the {SmartProxy}:

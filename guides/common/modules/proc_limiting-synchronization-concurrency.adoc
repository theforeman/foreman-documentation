[id="Limiting_Synchronization_Concurrency_{context}"]
= Limiting synchronization concurrency

[role="_abstract"]
By default, each Repository Synchronization job can fetch up to ten files at a time.
This can be adjusted on a per repository basis.

Increasing the limit may improve performance, but can cause the upstream server to be overloaded or start rejecting requests.
If you are seeing Repository syncs fail due to the upstream servers rejecting requests, you may want to try lowering the limit.

.Procedure
. Define a value for synchronization concurrency:

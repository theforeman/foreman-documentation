= Adding VMware Details to a Compute Profile

You can predefine certain hardware settings for virtual machines on VMware vSphere.
You achieve this through adding these hardware settings to a compute profile.
To use the CLI instead of the {ProjectWebUI}, see the xref:cli-adding-vmware-vsphere-details-to-a-compute-profile_{context}[].

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Infrastructure* > *Compute Profiles* and, in the Compute Profiles window, click the name of the compute profile, and then click the vSphere connection.
. In the *CPUs* field, enter the number of CPUs to allocate to the new host.
. In the *Cores per socket* field, enter the number of cores to allocate to each CPU.
. In the *Memory* field, enter the amount of memory to allocate to the new host.
. In the *Cluster* field, enter the name of the target host cluster on the VMware environment.
. From the *Resource pool* list, select an available resource allocations for the host.
. In the *Folder* field, enter the folder to organize the host.
. From the *Guest OS* list, select the operating system you want to use in VMware vSphere.
. From the *SCSI controller* list, select the disk access method for the host.
. From the *Virtual H/W version* list, select the underlying VMware hardware abstraction to use for virtual machines.
. You can select the *Memory hot add* or *CPU hot add* check boxes if you want to add more resources while the virtual machine is powered.
. From the *Image* list, select the image to use if performing image-based provisioning.
. From the *Network Interfaces* list, select the network parameters for the host's network interface.
You can create multiple network interfaces.
However, at least one interface must point to a {SmartProxy}-managed network.
. Select the *Eager zero* check box if you want to use eager zero thick provisioning.
If unchecked, the disk uses lazy zero thick provisioning.
. Click *Submit* to save the compute profile.

= Authenticating Hammer using a configuration file

[role="_abstract"]
If you ran the {Project} installation with `--foreman-initial-admin-username` and `--foreman-initial-admin-password` options, credentials you entered are stored in the `~/.hammer/cli.modules.d/foreman.yml` configuration file on {ProjectServer}.
Hammer does not prompt for your credentials when you run it on {ProjectServer}.

If you run a standalone Hammer, add your credentials to the Hammer configuration file.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you change your credentials on {ProjectServer}, you must update the configuration file manually.
The installer does not overwrite the configuration file.
====

.Procedure
* Add your credentials to the `~/.hammer/cli.modules.d/foreman.yml` configuration file:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
:foreman:
 :username: '_username_'
 :password: '_password_'
----
+
Use only spaces for indentation in hammer configuration files, do not use tabs.

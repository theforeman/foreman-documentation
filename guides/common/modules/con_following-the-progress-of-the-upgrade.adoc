= Following the progress of the upgrade

[role="_abstract"]
Using a utility such as `tmux` helps follow the progress of the upgrade without the need to maintain a continuous shell session.

Because of the lengthy upgrade time, use a utility such as `tmux` to suspend and reattach a communication session.
You can then check the upgrade progress without staying connected to the command shell continuously.

If you lose connection to the command shell where the upgrade command is running, you can see the logs in `{installer-log-file}` to check if the process completed successfully.

For more information about using `tmux`, see the `tmux(1)` man page on your system.

= Configuring Group Mapping for {Keycloak} Authentication

Optionally, to implement the Role Based Access Control (RBAC), create a group in {Project}, assign a role to this group, and then map an Active Directory group to the {Project} group.
As a result, anyone in the given group in {Keycloak} are logged in under the corresponding {Project} group.
This example configures users of the {Project}-admin user group in the Active Directory to authenticate as users with administrator privileges on {Project}.

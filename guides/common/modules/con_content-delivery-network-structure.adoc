Red{nbsp}Hat Content Delivery Network (CDN), located at `cdn.redhat.com`, is a geographically distributed series of static webservers which include content and errata designed to be used by systems.
This content can be accessed directly through a system registered using Subscription Manager or through the {ProjectWebUI}.
The accessible subset of the CDN is configured through content available to a system using https://access.redhat.com/management/[Red{nbsp}Hat Subscription Management] or using {ProjectServer}.

Red{nbsp}Hat Content Delivery network is protected by X.509 certificate authentication to ensure that only valid users can access it.

= Configuring custom alternate content sources by using {ProjectWebUI}

[role="_abstract"]
You can configure custom alternate content sources (ACS) to define alternate paths to download content during synchronization.

.Prerequisites
* If the repository requires SSL authentication, import the SSL certificate and key into {Project}.
For more information, see {ContentManagementDocURL}Importing_Custom_SSL_Certificates_content-management[Importing {customssl} certificates] in _{ContentManagementDocTitle}_.
* Note that the alternate content source paths consist of a base URL appended with the subpaths that you provide.
For example, if your base URL is `\https://{server-example-com}` and your subpaths are `rhel7/` and `rhel8/`, then both `\https://{server-example-com}/rhel7/` and `\https://{server-example-com}/rhel8/` will be searched.

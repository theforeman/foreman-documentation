= Overview of load balancing in {Project}

You can configure your {Project} environment to use a load balancer to distribute host requests and network load across multiple {SmartProxyServers}.
This results in an improved performance on {SmartProxyServers} and improved performance and stability for host connections to {Project}.
In a load-balanced setup, {SmartProxy} functionality supported for load balancing continues to work as expected when one {SmartProxyServer} is down for planned or unplanned maintenance.

= Uploading content to Deb repositories by using Hammer CLI

[role="_abstract"]
You can upload individual Deb packages to Deb repositories by using Hammer CLI.
Do not upload packages to a repository if you have set the *Upstream URL*.

.Procedure
* Upload a Deb package:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,verbatim"]
----
$ hammer repository upload-content \
--content-type deb \
--id _My_Repository_ID_ \
--path _/path/to/example-package.deb_
----

.Verification
* Verify that your Deb repository contains the Deb package that you have uploaded:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,verbatim"]
----
$ hammer deb list --repository-id _My_Repository_ID_
----

.Next steps
* Add your Deb repository to a content view.
For more information, see xref:creating-a-content-view-by-using-cli[].
* If your Deb repository is unprotected, hosts can consume its content by using the *Published At* URL.
+
In the Default Organization View content view, the URL consists of your {SmartProxy} FQDN, `/pulp/content/`, your organization label, `/Library/custom/`, your product label, `/`, your repository label, and a trailing `/`, for example, `\https://foreman.example.com/pulp/content/Example/Library/custom/my-software/my-app/`.
Use `katello` as the distribution to set up the repository on your host.

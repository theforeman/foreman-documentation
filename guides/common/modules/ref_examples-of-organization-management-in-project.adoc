You can use organizations to structure your content and host management based on your business needs, whether you run a small business, a large company with multiple business units, or manage hosts for external customers.

Single Organization::
Using a single organization is well suited for a small business with a simple system administration chain.
+
In this case, you create a single organization for the business and assign content to it.

Multiple Organizations::
Using multiple organizations is well suited for a large company that owns several smaller business units.
For example, a company with separate system administration and software development groups.
+
In this case, you create one organization for the company and then an organization for each of the business units it owns.
You then assign content to each organization based on its needs.

External Organizations::
Using external organizations is well suited for a company that manages external systems for other organizations.
For example, a company offering cloud computing and web hosting resources to customers.
+
In this case, you create an organization for the company's own system infrastructure and then an organization for each external business.
You then assign content to each organization where necessary.

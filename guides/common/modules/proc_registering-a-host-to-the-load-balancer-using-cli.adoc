= Registering a host to the load balancer using CLI

[role="_abstract"]
After setting the load balancer for host registration, you can register a host to the load balancer.

.Procedure
. Generate the host registration command using the Hammer CLI:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
$ hammer host-registration generate-command \
--activation-keys "_My_Activation_Key_"
----
+
If your hosts do not trust the SSL certificate of {ProjectServer}, you can disable SSL validation by adding the `--insecure` flag to the registration command.
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
$ hammer host-registration generate-command \
--activation-keys "_My_Activation_Key_" \
--insecure true
----
+
Include the `--smart-proxy-id __My_{smart-proxy-context-titlecase}_ID__` option.
You can use the ID of any {SmartProxyServer} that you configured for host registration load balancing.
{Project} will apply the load balancer to the registration command automatically.
+
Include the `--force` option to register a host that has been previously registered to a {SmartProxyServer}.
. Connect to your host using SSH and run the registration command.

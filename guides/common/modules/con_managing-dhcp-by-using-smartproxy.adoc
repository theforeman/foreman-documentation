= Managing DHCP by using {SmartProxy}

{Project} can integrate with a DHCP service by using your {SmartProxy}.
A {SmartProxy} has multiple DHCP providers that you can use to integrate {Project} with your existing DHCP infrastructure or deploy a new one.
You can use the DHCP module of {SmartProxy} to query for available IP addresses, add new, and delete existing reservations.

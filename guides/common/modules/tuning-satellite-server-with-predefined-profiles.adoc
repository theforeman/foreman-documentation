= Tuning {ProjectServer} with Predefined Profiles

If your {Project} deployment includes more than 5000 hosts, you can use predefined tuning profiles to improve performance of {ProjectServer}.
Choose one of the profiles depending on the number of hosts your {Project} manages and available hardware resources. The tuning profiles are available in the https://github.com/RedHatSatellite/satellite-support/tree/master/tuning-profiles[satellite-support GitHub repository].

MEDIUM::
Number of managed hosts: 5001-10000
+
RAM: 32G
+
Number of CPU cores: 8

LARGE::
Number of managed hosts: 10001-20000
+
RAM: 64G
+
Number of CPU cores: 16

X-LARGE::
Number of managed hosts: 20001-60000
+
RAM: 128G
+
Number of CPU cores: 32

2X-LARGE::
Number of managed hosts: 60000+
+
RAM: 256G
+
Number of CPU cores: 48+

.Procedure

To configure a tuning profile for your {Project} deployment, complete the following steps:

. On {ProjectServer}, back up the `/etc/foreman-installer/custom-hiera.yaml` file to `custom-hiera.original`:
+
----
# mv /etc/foreman-installer/custom-hiera.yaml \
/etc/foreman-installer/custom-hiera.original
----

. In your browser, navigate to https://github.com/RedHatSatellite/satellite-support/tree/master/tuning-profiles[tuning profiles] in the _satellite-support GitHub repository_ and click the profile that matches your {Project} deployment.

. Click the *Raw* button and preserve the URL to download the profile in the next step.

. Download the tuning profile, for example, using `curl` with the URL of the profile in the raw format:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RedHatSatellite/satellite-support/master/tuning-profiles/_custom-hiera-large-64G.yaml_
----

. Copy the tuning profile that matches your {Project} deployment to `/etc/foreman-installer/custom-hiera.yaml`:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# cp _custom-hiera-large-64G_.yaml /etc/foreman-installer/custom-hiera.yaml
----

. Optional: If you added custom settings to `custom-hiera.yaml`, copy them from the backed up to the new `custom-hiera.yaml` file:

. Optional: If you upgrade your {Project}, search the backed up `/etc/foreman-installer/custom-hiera.original` file for the strings in the following format and copy them to the new `/etc/foreman-installer/custom-hiera.yaml` file:
+
----
# Added by foreman-installer during upgrade, run the installer with --upgrade-mongo-storage to upgrade to WiredTiger.
mongodb::server::storage_engine: 'mmapv1'
----

. Enter the `{foreman-installer}` command with no arguments to apply settings:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-installer}
----

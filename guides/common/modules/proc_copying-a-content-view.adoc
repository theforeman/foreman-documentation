[id="Copying_a_Content_View_{context}"]
= Copying a content view

You can copy a content view in the {ProjectWebUI} or you can use the Hammer CLI to copy an existing content view into a new content view.
To use the CLI instead of the {ProjectWebUI}, see the xref:cli-copying-a-content-view_{context}[].

[NOTE]
====
A copied content view does not have the same history as the original content view.
Version 1 of the copied content view begins at the last version of the original content view.
As a result, you cannot promote an older version of a content view from the copied content view.
====

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Content* > *Lifecycle* > *Content Views*.
. Select the content view you want to copy.
. Click the vertical ellipsis icon and click *Copy*.
. In the *Name* field, enter a name for the new content view and click *Copy content view*.

.Verification
* The copied content view appears on the *Content views* page.

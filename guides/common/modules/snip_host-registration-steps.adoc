You can register hosts with {Project} using the host registration feature in the {ProjectWebUI}, Hammer CLI, or the {Project} API.
For more information, see {ManagingHostsDocURL}registering_hosts_to_server_managing-hosts[Registering hosts and setting up host integration] in _{ManagingHostsDocTitle}_.

ifeval::["{context}" == "load-balancing"]
.Prerequisites

If your hosts do not trust the SSL certificate of {ProjectServer}, you can disable SSL validation by adding the `--insecure` flag to the registration command.

Include the `--smart-proxy-id __My_{smart-proxy-context-titlecase}_ID__` option.
You can use the ID of any {SmartProxyServer} that you configured for host registration load balancing.
{Project} will apply the load balancer to the registration command automatically.

Include the `--force` option to register a host that has been previously registered to a {SmartProxyServer}.
endif::[]
. Connect to your host using SSH and run the registration command.
ifdef::satellite[]

Use an activation key to simplify specifying the environments.
For more information, see {ContentManagementDocURL}Managing_Activation_Keys_content-management[Managing Activation Keys] in _{ContentManagementDocTitle}_.

ifdef::load-balancing[]

Include `{ "smart_proxy_id": __My_{smart-proxy-context-titlecase}_ID__ }`.
You can use the ID of any {SmartProxyServer} that you configured for host registration load balancing.
{Project} will apply the load balancer to the registration command automatically.

Include `{ "force": true }` to register a host that has been previously registered to a {SmartProxyServer}.
endif::[]

To enter a password as a command line argument, use `username:password` syntax.
Keep in mind this can save the password in the shell history.
Alternatively, you can use a temporary personal access token instead of a password.
To generate a token in the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *My Account* > *Personal Access Tokens*.
. Connect to your host using SSH and run the registration command.

= Using an HTTP proxy for all {Project} HTTP requests by using Hammer CLI

[role="_abstract"]
If your {ProjectServer} must remain behind a firewall that blocks HTTP and HTTPS, you can configure an HTTP proxy for communication with external systems, including compute resources, by using Hammer CLI.

Note that if you are using compute resources for provisioning, and you want to use a different HTTP proxy with the compute resources, the HTTP proxy that you set for all {Project} communication takes precedence over the HTTP proxies that you set for compute resources.

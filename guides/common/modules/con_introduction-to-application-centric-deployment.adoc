= Introduction to Application Centric Deployment

_Application Centric Deployment_ (ACD) describes a fundamentally different approach to provisioning and configuring hosts in {Project}.
Traditionally, {ProjectName} has pursued a host-centric approach.
Now, the ACD approach presents a new idea: deploying hosts to run an application that requires a predefined set of services.

Generally, an application consists of multiple services and therefore requires different kinds of hosts connected to each other.
These hosts have dependencies on each other, for example, an application server might require a database server.

The number of deployed hosts depends on the expected usage of the application.
You can scale an application instance vertically via compute profile or horizontally by choosing multiple hosts to run the same service to handle increased workloads.

Within ACD, Ansible playbooks are executed on {ProjectServer}.
Ensure that {ProjectServer} can connect to all managed hosts using Ansible.

|===
|
|Host Centric Deployment
|Application Centric Deployment

|Requirements
|none (possible by default)
|ACD plugin

|Focus
|individual hosts
|applications

|Number of Hosts
|one
|one to many

|Automation
|via Host Group
|via Ansible playbook and application definition

|Advantages
|full control over each host
|deploy a number of hosts at once; self service for technically less inclined; scale vertically and/or horizontally

|Disadvantages
|extra abstraction layer between a host and its purpose
|dependency on/limitation to existing application templates

= Adding a Proxmox Connection to {ProjectServer}

Use this procedure to add a Proxmox connection to {Project}.
If your Proxmox instance consists of multiple nodes, you have to create a Proxmox connection to {Project} for each node.

.Prerequisites
* Ensure that the host and network-based firewalls are configured to allow communication from {Project} to Proxmox on TCP port 443.
* Verify that {ProjectServer} is able to resolve the host name of your Proxmox compute resource and Proxmox is able to resolve the host name of {ProjectServer}.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Infrastructure* > *Compute Resources*.
. Click *Create Compute Resource*.
. In the *Name* field, enter a name for the compute resource.
. From the *Provider* list, select *Proxmox*.
. Optional: In the *Description* field, enter a description for the compute resource.
. Optional: In the *Authentication method* list, select `User token` if you do not want to use access tickets to authenticate on Proxmox.
. In the *Url* field, enter the IP address or host name of your Proxmox node.
Ensure to specify its port and add `/api2/json` to its path.
. In the *Username* field, enter the user name to access Proxmox.
. In the *Password* field, enter the password for the user.
. Optional: Select the *SSL verify peer* checkbox to verify the certificate used for the encrypted connection from {Project} to Proxmox.
. In the *X509 Certificate Authorities* field, enter a certificate authority or a correctly ordered chain of certificate authorities.
. Optional: Click *Test Connection* to verify the URL and its corresponding credentials.
. Click *Submit* to save the connection.

= Requirements for {Project} installation in an IPv6 network

Before installing {Project} in an IPv6 network, ensure that you meet the following requirements:

* You must deploy an external DHCPv6 server as a separate, unmanaged service to communicate with the network boot process and to manage IP address assignment.
This is required because the {SmartProxy} DHCP plugin does not provide support for DHCPv6 management.
For more information about DHCPv6 server configuration, see {ProvisioningHostsDocURL}options-in-unmanaged-dhcpv6[Options in unmanaged DHCPv6] in _{ProvisioningHostsDocTitle}_.

* You must deploy an external HTTP proxy server that supports both IPv4 and IPv6.
This is required because Red Hat Content Delivery Network distributes content only over IPv4 networks, therefore you must use this proxy to pull content into the {Project} on your IPv6 network.
endif::[]

* Optional: If you rely on content from IPv4 networks, you must deploy an external IPv4 HTTP proxy server.
This is required to access Content Delivery Networks that distribute content only over IPv4 networks, therefore you must use this proxy to pull content into {Project} on your IPv6 network.
endif::[]

* You must configure {Project} to use this dual stack (supporting both IPv4 and IPv6) HTTP proxy server as the default proxy.
For more information, see {InstallingServerDocURL}adding-a-default-http-proxy_{project-context}[Adding a Default HTTP Proxy to {Project}].

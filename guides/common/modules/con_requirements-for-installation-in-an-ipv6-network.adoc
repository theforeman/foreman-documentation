= Requirements for {Project} Installation in an IPv6 Network 

Before installing {Project} in an IPv6 network, ensure that you meet the following requirements:

ifeval::["{build}" == "satellite"]
* If you plan to provision hosts from {Project} or {SmartProxies}, you must install {Project} and {SmartProxies} on {RHEL} version 7.9 or higher because these versions include the latest version of the `grub2` package.
endif::[]

ifeval::["{build}" != "satellite"]
* If you plan to provision hosts from {Project} or {SmartProxy}, you must install {Project} and {SmartProxies} on a system with `grub2` version 2.05 or higher or system with fixes for HTTP Boot, for example CentOS version 7.9 or 8.3 or higher. For other operating systems, copy the newest GRUB build to `/var/lib/tftpboot/grub2/grubx64.efi`.
endif::[]

* You must deploy an external DHCP IPv6 server as a separate unmanaged service to bootstrap clients into GRUB2, which then configures IPv6 networking either using DHCPv6 or or assigning static IPv6 address. This is required because the DHCP server in {RHEL} (ISC DHCP) does not provide an integration API for managing IPv6 records, therefore the {SmartProxy} DHCP plug-in that provides DHCP management is limited to IPv4 subnets.

* You must deploy an external IPv4 HTTP proxy server. This is required because {Project} distributes content only over IPv4 networks, therefore you must use an IPv4 proxy to redirect that content to hosts in your IPv6 network.
ifeval::["{build}" != "satellite"]

Note that this requirement is for Katello users only.
endif::[]

* You must configure {Project} to use this IPv4 HTTP proxy server as the default proxy.

= {SmartProxyServer} Scalability Considerations

The maximum number of {SmartProxyServer}s that {ProjectServer} can support has no fixed limit.
ifndef::satellite[]
The tested limit is 17 {SmartProxyServer}s with 2 vCPUs on a {ProjectServer}.
endif::[]
However, scalability is highly variable, especially when managing Puppet clients.

{SmartProxyServer} scalability when managing Puppet clients depends on the number of CPUs, the run-interval distribution, and the number of Puppet managed resources.
{SmartProxyServer} has a limitation of 100 concurrent Puppet agents running at any single point in time.
Running more than 100 concurrent Puppet agents results in a 503 HTTP error.

For example, assuming that Puppet agent runs are evenly distributed with less than 100 concurrent Puppet agents running at any single point during a run-interval, a {SmartProxyServer} with 4 CPUs has a maximum of 1250{range}1600 Puppet clients with a moderate workload of 10 Puppet classes assigned to each Puppet client.
Depending on the number of Puppet clients required, the {Project} installation can scale out the number of {SmartProxyServer}s to support them.

If you want to scale your {SmartProxyServer} when managing Puppet clients, the following assumptions are made:

* There are no external Puppet clients reporting directly to the {Project} integrated {SmartProxy}.
* All other Puppet clients report directly to an external {SmartProxy}.
* There is an evenly distributed run-interval of all Puppet agents.

NOTE: Deviating from the even distribution increases the risk of overloading {ProjectServer}.
The limit of 100 concurrent requests applies.

The following table describes the scalability limits using the recommended 4 CPUs.

The following table describes the scalability limits using the minimum 2 CPUs.

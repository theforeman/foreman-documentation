[id="{context}_architecture"]
= Architecture

ACD uses {SmartProxies} and a remote execution provider called `acd`.

Ansible playbooks are downloaded from {ProjectServer} to {SmartProxyServer} before being executed.
Submit any Ansible playbooks that you want to use to {ProjectServer}.
You do not have to manually add Ansible playbooks to {SmartProxyServer}s.

[id="{context}_ansible_playbooks"]
== Ansible Playbooks

Ansible playbooks provide the configuration of deployed applications.
They are required along with to an xref:{context}_application_definitions[application definition] to create xref:{context}_application_instances[application instances].

Ansible group variables are mandatory and only supported as `key:value`, that is lists and dictionaries are currently not allowed and cannot be edited via management UI.

Ansible playbooks need to contain Ansible group variables for each provided service.

The Ansible inventory is automatically created by the ACD plugin.

In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Applications > Ansible Playbooks* to manage Ansible playbooks for application centric deployment.

[CAUTION]
====
The Ansible playbook must contain all necessary roles and tasks to execute the playbook.

If your Ansible playbooks are currently using Ansible collections, ensure that these Ansible collections are added manually to every {SmartProxyServer}.
To install Ansible collections manually, enter the following command on your {ProjectServer} and {SmartProxyServer}:

[source,bash]
----
# ansible-galaxy collection install _namespace.collection_
----

Replace `namespace.collection` with the Ansible collection you are intending to use, for example `community.general`.
This uses the Ansible galaxy as configured in the `ansible.cfg` file.

[id="{context}_application_definitions"]
== Application Definitions

Application definitions are blueprints of deployed applications.
They are required along with an xref:{context}_ansible_playbooks[Ansible playbook] to create xref:{context}_application_instances[application instances].

Application definitions consist of a list of services and Ansible group variables and serve as a preconfigured _blueprint_ providing easy self service for end users.
Each service has a name, host group, Ansible group, and minimum and maximum number of host running this service.

Users with administrative access to {ProjectName} handle application definitions and specify the allowed number of hosts for each service.

In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Applications > App Definitions* to add, edit, and remove application definitions for application centric deployment.

[id="{context}_application_instances"]
== Application Instances

An application instance is based on a preconfigured xref:{context}_application_definitions[application definition].
You can use an application instance to automatically deploy and configure hosts based on its application definition and Ansible playbook.

Based on one application definition, end users can configure and deploy multiple application instances.

In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Applications > App Instances* to add, deploy, and remove application instances for application centric deployment.

[id="{context}_ansible_variables_and_parameter_hierarchy"]
== Ansible Variables and Parameter Hierarchy

There are different levels on how to set Ansible variables and parameters for a service/host.

.Ansible variables
* On the base, there are Ansible group variables for _all_ services as defined in the Ansible playbook.
* Next, there are Ansible group variables defined for _all_ services in the application definition.
Individual Ansible variables can be locked, removed, or added to the application definition.
They overwrite the ones from the Ansible playbook.
* An application definition also contains Ansible variables for _service groups_.
These overwrite Ansible variables set for all services.
* An application instance can overwrite any unlocked Ansible variables from the application definition.

.Parameters
* Managed hosts inherit parameters from multiple entities:
** Global parameters
** Organization parameters
** Location parameters
** Domain parameters
** Subnet parameters
** Operating system parameters
** Host group parameters
** Host parameters

+
For example, domain level parameters overwrite both location and organization based parameters and host parameters overwrite any other defined parameter.

Refer to the https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_variables.html#variable-precedence-where-should-i-put-a-variable[Ansible documentation] for more information about Ansible variable precedence.

[id="{context}_user_roles"]
== User Roles

The ACD plugin requires the specific {ProjectName} permissions.
Depending on your environment, there might be two different groups of users in regard to _managing_ an application and _deploying_ an application:

* An administrative group of users might be responsible for providing the tools to deploy an application, that is an Ansible playbook and application definition.
* An end user group might be using {ProjectName} to deploy applications, that is creating and deploying application instances based on application definitions within their organization and location context.
Many application instances can be created based on the same application definition.

By default, there are two ACD user roles:

.Application Centric Deployment Manager
Configuring Ansible playbooks and application definitions requires the `Application Centric Deployment Manager` user role.
It bundles permissions to manage Ansible playbooks, application definitions, and application instances as well as using ACD remote execution features.
This role is suited for administrative users.

The ACD manager role includes permissions to deploy and configure hosts; to manage Ansible playbooks, application definitions, and application instances; and to view, create, and cancel job invocations and templates.

.Application Centric Deployment User
Creating and deploying application instances requires the `Application Centric Deployment User` user role.
It bundles permissions to manage application instances and access to the ACD remote execution features.
This role is suited for end users.

The ACD user role includes permissions to deploy and configure hosts; to manage application instances; and to view, create, and cancel job invocations and templates.

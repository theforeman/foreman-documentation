= Importing all available Ansible playbooks

You can import all the available Ansible playbooks to {Project} from collections installed on {SmartProxy}.
{Project} creates job templates from the imported playbooks and places the templates in the `Ansible Playbook - Imported` job category.

If you have a custom collection, place it in `/etc/ansible/collections/ansible_collections/_My_Namespace_/_My_Collection_`.

.Prerequisites
* Ansible plugin is enabled.
* Your {Project} account has a role that grants the `import_ansible_playbooks` permission.

.Procedure
// Not available via Hammer/UI: https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/34318
* Import the Ansible playbooks by using the following API request:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# curl -X PUT -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://_{foreman-example-com}_/ansible/api/v2/ansible_playbooks/sync?proxy_id=__My_{smart-proxy-context}_ID__
----
+
You get a notification in the {ProjectWebUI} after the import completes.

.Next steps
* You can run the playbooks by executing a remote job from the created job templates.

= Using the KernelCare Plug-in

You can use the KernelCare plug-in to patch the Linux kernel on managed hosts without rebooting them.
The plug-in provides job templates to view and live-patch the Linux kernel on managed hosts and ensures managed hosts do not report to {ProjectServer} that a reboot is required through tracer.
For more information, see https://tuxcare.com/live-patching-services/[tuxcare.com/live-patching-services] and https://docs.tuxcare.com/live-patching-services/[docs.tuxcare.com/live-patching-services].

[IMPORTANT]
====
The KernelCare plug-in is a technical preview.
{Team} does not recommend running this in your production environment.

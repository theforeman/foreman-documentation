= Understanding Package mode and Image mode hosts

You can operate hosts in two modes: package mode and image mode.

.Image mode hosts
Image mode hosts include additional fields that reflect their boot status.
These fields track the container images used in various scenarios:

* *Booted Image & Digest*: Indicates the container image the host is currently using.
* *Staged Image & Digest*: Indicates the container image the host uses after the next reboot.
* *Available Image & Digest*: Represents the container image cached by running `bootc upgrade --check`.
* *Rollback Image & Digest*: Represents the container image the host reverts to after the next reboot if `Bootc rollback` is applied.

.All host listing page updates
* *New Column for Host Types*: On the new Hosts Overview page, the host listing page includes a column with icons that indicate the host type.
Note that users can add or remove the image mode column by using the *Manage columns* feature.
** Clicking an icon displays the image path and digest.
** Note that the image path can be used directly with podman or docker to pull the image from a registry.
* *Search Enhancements*:
** Use `image_mode=true` or `image_mode=false` to filter hosts by type.
** Unregistered systems are assumed to be in package mode.
** Search using eight new fields:
`Bootc_booted_image`, `Bootc_booted_digest`, `Bootc_staged_image`, `Bootc_staged_digest`, `Bootc_available_image`, `Bootc_available_digest`, `Bootc_rollback_image`, `Bootc_rollback_digest`.

.Host Details Page Enhancements
A new card appears on the Details tab for registered hosts, displaying the additional fields from `Bootc`.

.Important Notes
* *Pull-Mode Remote Execution*: For pull-mode remote execution users, related packages must be included in the image mode host's container image.

This distinction between package mode and image mode provides greater flexibility in managing host systems and streamlines operations for image-based deployments.

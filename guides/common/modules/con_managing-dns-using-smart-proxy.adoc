= Managing DNS Using {SmartProxy}

{Project} can manage DNS records using your {SmartProxy}.
DNS management contains updating and removing DNS records from existing DNS zones.
A {SmartProxy} has multiple DNS providers that you can use to integrate {Project} with your existing DNS infrastructure or deploy a new one.

After you have enabled DNS, your {SmartProxy} can manipulate any DNS server that complies with RFC 2136 using the `dns_nsupdate` provider.
Other providers provide more direct integration, such as `dns_infoblox` for https://www.infoblox.com/[Infoblox].

= HTTP-based boot loaders

[role="_abstract"]
In addition to the *TFTP-based PXE* mechanism, {Project} supports boot methods that use *HTTP*.
HTTP-based boot methods use the {SmartProxy}’s *HTTPBoot* module to deliver bootloaders and installation files.
HTTP-based boot methods in {Project} are *iPXE*, *iPXE chainloading*, and *Grub2 UEFI HTTP Boot*.
Each method offers advantages depending on the firmware type and network environment.

The *HTTPBoot* feature exposes the same files that are available via TFTP, but over the HTTP or HTTPS protocol.
This can improve boot reliability in environments where TFTP is blocked, unreliable, or slow.

The boot methods in {Project} use the following boot workflows:

iPXE chainloading (PXE to HTTP)::

The boot process starts with a traditional PXE (TFTP) stage and then switches to HTTP for improved performance and flexibility.
With this hybrid approach, existing PXE infrastructure can use HTTP for the later boot stages without requiring firmware-level HTTP support.
+
iPXE chainloading uses the following workflow:
+
. The firmware downloads the appropriate iPXE loader via TFTP.
  * BIOS downloads `undionly-ipxe.0`.
  * UEFI downloads `ipxe.efi`.
. iPXE initializes the network and switches to HTTP, requesting an iPXE script such as `menu.ipxe`.

iPXE and Grub2 UEFI HTTP(S) boot::

UEFI firmware directly loads boot loaders by using HTTP or HTTPS without any TFTP step.
+
iPXE and Grub2 UEFI HTTP(S) Boot use the following workflow:
+
. UEFI firmware requests boot loader files from the {SmartProxy} via HTTP or HTTPS, for example, `ipxe-__<arch>__.efi`.
. Grub2 loads `grub.cfg` and starts the OS installer.

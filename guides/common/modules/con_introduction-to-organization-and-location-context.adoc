[id="Introduction_to_Organization_and_Location_Context_{context}"]
= Introduction to Organization and Location Context in {Project}

Context in {Project} consists of xref:Managing_Organizations_{context}[Organizations] and xref:Managing_Locations_{context}[Locations].

Most resources in {Project} are associated with at least one organization and location context.
Since resources and users can generally only access resources within their own context, organizations and locations are an integral part of {Project}'s user management.

You can structure locations hierarchically by providing a parent location.
Unless otherwise specified, sub locations inherit the settings from their parent location.

[CAUTION]
====
If you use host groups to bundle provisioning and configuration information, ensure to not mismatch resources from mutually exclusive contexts.
For example, setting a subnet from one organization or location and a compute resource from a different organization or location creates an invalid host group.

Some resources in {Project}, such as Ansible roles and operating systems, are not part of any organization or location context.

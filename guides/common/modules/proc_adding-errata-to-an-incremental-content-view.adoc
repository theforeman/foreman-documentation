= Adding Errata to an Incremental Content View

If errata are available but not installable, you can create an incremental Content View version to add the errata to your content hosts.
For example, if the Content View is version 1.0, it becomes Content View version 1.1, and when you publish, it becomes Content View version 2.0.

To use the CLI instead of the {ProjectWebUI}, see the xref:cli-adding-errata-to-an-incremental-content-view[].

Be careful when incrementally adding enhancement errata.
Enhancements are typically scoped to the most current software in a repository, so you may find incompatibilities if your content view version is old.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Content* > *Errata*.
. From the *Errata* list, click the name of the errata that you want to apply.
. Select the content hosts that you want to apply the errata to, and click *Apply to Hosts*.
This creates the incremental update to the Content View.
. If you want to apply the errata to the content host, select the *Apply Errata to Content Hosts immediately after publishing* checkbox.
. Click *Confirm* to apply the errata.

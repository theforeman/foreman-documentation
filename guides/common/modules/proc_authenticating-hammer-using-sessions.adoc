= Authenticating Hammer using sessions

The hammer authentication session is a cache that stores your credentials, and you have to provide them only once, at the beginning of the session.
This method is suited to running several hammer commands in succession, for example a script containing hammer commands.
In this scenario, you enter your {Project} credentials once, and the script runs as expected.
By using the hammer authentication session, you avoid storing your credentials in the script itself and in the `~/.hammer/cli.modules.d/foreman.yml` hammer configuration file.

See the instructions on how to use the sessions:

* To enable sessions, add `:use_sessions: true` to the `~/.hammer/cli.modules.d/foreman.yml` file:
+
----
:foreman:
 :use_sessions: true
----
Note that if you enable sessions, credentials stored in the configuration file will be ignored.
+
* To start a session, enter the following command:
+
----
# hammer auth login
----
+
You are prompted for your {Project} credentials, and logged in.
You will not be prompted for the credentials again until your session expires.
+
* The default length of a session is 60 minutes.
You can change the time to suit your preference.
For example, to change it to 30 minutes, enter the following command:
+
----
# hammer settings set --name idle_timeout --value 30
Setting [idle_timeout] updated to [30]
----
+
* To see the current status of the session, enter the following command:
+
----
# hammer auth status
----
+
* To end the session, enter the following command:
+
----
# hammer auth logout
----

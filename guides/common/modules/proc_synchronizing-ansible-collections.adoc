Ansible Collections will appear on {Project} as a new repository type in the {ProjectWebUI} menu under *Content* after the sync.

NOTE: Ansible Collections live in the Library environment and the lifecycle management is not supported.
{SmartProxies} with Pulp 3 have collections support and will sync collection repositories if tied to the Library environment.
You can also use Export functionality for {ISS}.

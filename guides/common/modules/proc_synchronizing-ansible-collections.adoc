= Synchronizing Ansible Collections

On {Project}, you can synchronize your Ansible Collections from Private Automation Hub, `console.redhat.com`, and other {Project} instances.
Ansible Collections will appear on {Project} as a new repository type in the {ProjectWebUI} menu under *Content* after the sync.

NOTE: Ansible Collections live in the Library environment and the lifecycle management is not supported.
{SmartProxies} with Pulp 3 have collections support and will sync collection repositories if tied to the Library environment.
You can also use Export functionality for {ISS}.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Content* > *Products*.
. Select the required product name.
. In the *Products* window, select the name of a product that you want to create a repository for.
. Click the *Repositories* tab, and then click *New Repository*.
. In the *Name* field, enter a name for the repository.
+
The *Label* field is populated automatically based on the name.
. From the *Type* list, select *ansible collection*.
. In the *Upstream URL* field, enter the URL for the upstream collections repository.
+
The URL can be any Galaxy endpoint.
For example, `\https://console.redhat.com/api/automation-hub/`.
. Optional: In the *Requirements.yml* field, you can specify the list of collections you want to sync from the endpoint, as well as their versions.
+
If you do not specify the list of collections, everything from the endpoint will be synced.

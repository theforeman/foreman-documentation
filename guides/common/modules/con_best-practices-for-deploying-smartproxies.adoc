= Best practices for deploying {SmartProxies}

* Install a {SmartProxyServer} in each of your geographic locations.
By assigning a {SmartProxy} to each location, you decrease the load on {ProjectServer}, increase redundancy, and reduce bandwidth usage.
+
[NOTE]
====
The maximum number of {SmartProxyServers} that {ProjectServer} can support has no fixed limit.
It was tested that a {ProjectServer} can support 17 {SmartProxyServers} with 2 vCPUs.
====
* Your {ProjectServer} contains an integrated {SmartProxy}.
Do not use the integrated {SmartProxyServer} to communicate with hosts in remote locations because it can lead to suboptimal network utilization.
* Decide what services you want to enable on each {SmartProxyServer}.
* Decide whether you want to run DNS, DHCP, and TFTP on your {SmartProxyServers} or whether you want to configure your {SmartProxyServers} to use services provided by an external server.

* For more information about installing {SmartProxyServer}, including information about configuring a {SmartProxyServer} with external services, see {InstallingSmartProxyDocURL}[_{InstallingSmartProxyDocTitle}_].

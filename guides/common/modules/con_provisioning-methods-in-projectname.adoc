= Provisioning Methods in {ProjectName}

Provisioning methods are part of the {ProjectName} application life cycle to create, manage, and update hosts.

With {ProjectName}, you can provision hosts by using the following methods:

Bare Metal Provisioning::
{Project} provisions bare metal hosts primarily by using PXE boot and MAC address identification.
When provisioning bare metal hosts with {Project}, you can do the following:
+
* Create host entries and specify the MAC address of the physical host to provision.
* Boot blank hosts to use the {Project} discovery service, which creates a pool of hosts that are ready to be provisioned.

* Boot and provision hosts by using PXE-less methods.
endif::[]

Cloud Providers::
{Project} connects to private and public cloud providers to provision instances of hosts from images that are stored with the cloud environment.
When provisioning from cloud with {Project}, you can do the following:
+
* Select which hardware profile or flavor to use.
* Provision cloud instances from specific providers by using their APIs.

Virtualization Infrastructure::
{Project} connects to virtualization infrastructure services, such as {oVirt} and VMware.
When provisioning virtual machines with {Project}, you can do the following:
+
* Provision virtual machines from virtual image templates.
* Use the same PXE-based boot methods as bare metal providers.

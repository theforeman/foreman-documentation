= Creating a webhook template

[role="_abstract"]
Webhook templates are used to generate the body of HTTP request to a configured target when a webhook is triggered.
Use the following procedure to create a webhook template in the {ProjectWebUI}.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Administer* > *Webhook* > *Webhook Templates*.
. Click *Clone an existing template* or *Create Template*.
. Enter a name for the template.
. Use the editor to make changes to the template payload.
+
A webhook HTTP payload must be created using {Project} template syntax.
The webhook template can use a special variable called `@object` that can represent the main object of the event.
`@object` can be missing in case of certain events.
You can determine what data are actually available with the `@payload` variable.
+
For more information, see {ManagingHostsDocURL}Template_Writing_Reference_managing-hosts[Template Writing Reference] in _{ManagingHostsDocTitle}_ and for available template macros and methods, visit `/templates_doc` on {ProjectServer}.
+
. Optional: Enter the description and audit comment.
. Assign organizations and locations.
. Click *Submit*.

.Examples
When creating a webhook template, you must follow the format of the target application for which the template is intended.
For example, an application can expect a `"text"` field with the webhook message.
Refer to the documentation of your target application to find more about how your webhook template format should look like.

= Preparing Cloud-init Images in {oVirt}

To use `cloud-init` during provisioning, you must prepare an image with `cloud-init` installed in {oVirt}, and then import the image to {Project} to use for provisioning.

.Procedure

. In {oVirt}, create a virtual machine to use for image-based provisioning in {Project}.
. On the virtual machine, install `cloud-init`:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
{package-install} cloud-init
----
+
. To the `/etc/cloud/cloud.cfg` file, add the following information:
+
----
datasource_list: ["NoCloud", "ConfigDrive"]
----
+
. In {oVirt}, create an image from this virtual machine.

When you add this image to {Project}, ensure that you select the *User Data* checkbox.

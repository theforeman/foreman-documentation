= High-level steps for configuration management with Puppet

[role="_abstract"]
After you deploy Puppet agent on a host, use {Project} to manage Puppet modules, import classes, set parameter overrides, and assign classes to hosts so configuration is applied automatically or on demand.

Configuration management with Puppet involves the following high-level steps:

. Managing Puppet modules on the Puppet server, that is installing and updating them.
. Importing Puppet classes and environments from Puppet modules into {Project}.
. Optional: Creating config groups from Puppet classes.
. Configuring overrides of Smart Class parameters on various levels.
. Assigning Puppet classes or config groups to host groups or individual hosts.
. Configuring intervals for runs of the Puppet agent on hosts and for configuration enforcement runs of the Puppet server.
. Monitoring configuration management using reports in the {ProjectWebUI}.
For more information, see {AdministeringDocURL}monitoring-{project-context}-resources[Monitoring {Project} resources] in _{AdministeringDocTitle}_.
. Configuring email notifications.
For more information, see {AdministeringDocURL}Configuring_Email_Notification_Preferences_admin[Configuring Email Notification Preferences] in _{AdministeringDocTitle}_.

After assigning Puppet classes or config groups, {Project} runs configuration management automatically in the configured intervals to enforce Puppet configuration on your hosts, or you can initiate it manually on demand with the *Run Puppet Once* feature.

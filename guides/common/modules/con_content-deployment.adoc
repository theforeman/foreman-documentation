[[sect-Defining_Content_Deployment]]
= Content deployment

Content deployment manages errata and packages on content hosts.
{Project} can be configured to perform remote execution over MQTT/HTTPS (pull-based) or SSH (push-based).
While remote execution is enabled on {ProjectServer} by default, it is disabled on {SmartProxyServers} and content hosts.
You must enable it manually.

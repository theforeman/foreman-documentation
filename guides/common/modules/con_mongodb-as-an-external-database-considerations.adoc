= MongoDB as an External Database Considerations

Pulp uses the MongoDB database. If you want to use MongoDB as an external database, the following information can help you decide if this option is right for your {Project} configuration. {Project} supports MongoDB version 3.4.

.Advantages of External MongoDB

 * Increase in free memory and free CPU on {Project}
 * Flexibility to tune the MongoDB server's system without adversely affecting {Project} operations

.Disadvantages of External MongoDB

* Increase in deployment complexity that can make troubleshooting more difficult
* An external MongoDB server is an additional system to patch and maintain
* If either the {Project} or the Mongo database server suffers a hardware or storage failure, {Project} is not operational
* If there is latency between the {Project} and the external database server, performance can suffer

.FIPS-related Restrictions

* You cannot use an external MongoDB with {Project} in FIPS mode.

ifeval::["{build} == "satellite"]
If you suspect that your Mongo database is slow, you can work with Red Hat Support to troubleshoot. You might be encountering a configuration problem or existing performance problems with {ProjectX} that moving to an external database server might not help. Red Hat Support can examine existing known issues and also work with the {Project} Engineering team to determine the root cause.

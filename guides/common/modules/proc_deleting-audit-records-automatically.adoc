= Deleting audit records automatically

[role="_abstract"]
You can automatically delete audit records using the `Saved audits interval` setting.
This setting is empty by default, meaning {Project} does not automatically delete the audit records.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Administer* > *Settings*.
. On the *General* tab, find the *Saved audits interval* setting.
. Set the value of the setting to the number of days after which you want {Project} to delete the audit records.

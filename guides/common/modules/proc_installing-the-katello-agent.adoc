= Installing the Katello Agent

You can install the Katello agent to remotely update {Project} clients.

NOTE: The Katello agent is deprecated and will be removed in a future {Project} version. Migrate your processes to use the remote execution feature to update clients remotely. For more information, see {BaseURL}managing_hosts/host-management-without-goferd-and-katello-agent_managing-hosts[Host Management Without Goferd and Katello Agent] in the _Managing Hosts Guide_.

The `katello-agent` package depends on the `gofer` package that provides the `goferd` service. This service must be enabled so that {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer} can provide information about errata that are applicable for content hosts.

= Installing the Katello Agent

You can install the Katello agent to remotely update {Project} clients.

NOTE: The Katello agent is deprecated and will be removed in a future {Project} version.
Migrate your processes to use the remote execution feature to update clients remotely.
For more information, see {ManagingHostsDocURL}host-management-without-goferd-and-katello-agent_managing-hosts[Host Management Without Goferd and Katello Agent] in the _Managing Hosts Guide_.

[id='metrics-data-retention_{context}']
= Metrics data retention

The storage capacity required by PCP data logging is determined by the following factors:

* The logged metrics
* The logging interval
* The retention policy

The default logging (sampling) interval is 60 seconds.
The default retention policy is to compress archives older than one day and to keep archives for the last 14 days.

You can increase the logging interval or shorten the retention policy to save storage space.
If you require high-resolution sampling, you can decrease the logging interval.
In such case, ensure that you have enough storage space.

PCP archive logs are stored in the `/var/log/pcp/pmlogger/_{foreman-example-com}_` directory.

= Metrics Data Retention

The storage capacity required by PCP data logging is determined by the following factors:

* The metrics being logged.
* The logging interval.
* The retention policy.

The default logging (sampling) interval is 60 seconds.

The default retention policy is to keep archives for the last 14 days, compressing archives older than one day.
PCP archive logs are stored in the `/var/log/pcp/pmlogger/_{foreman-example-com}_` directory.

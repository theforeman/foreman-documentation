= Generating Insights Inventory reports

You can use the Hammer CLI to manually generate and manage Insights Inventory reports. 
This is useful in disconnected environments where {Project} cannot upload reports automatically. 
In connected environments, {Project} automatically generates and uploads these reports daily.

.CLI procedure
Use the following options to manage Insights Inventory reports:

. Download the most recently generated report:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
$ hammer insights inventory download-report \
  --organization "My_Organization" \
  --location "My_Location"
----

. Generate an inventory report and upload it to the {RHCloud}:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
$ hammer insights inventory generate-report \
  --organization "My_Organization" \
  --location "My_Location"
----

. Generate the report without uploading it, such as when running on a disconnected {ProjectServer}.
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
$ hammer insights inventory generate-report \
  --organization "My_Organization" \
  --location "My_Location" \
  --no-upload
----

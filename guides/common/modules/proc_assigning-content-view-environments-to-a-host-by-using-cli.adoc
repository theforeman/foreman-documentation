= Assigning content view environments to a host by using Hammer CLI

[role="_abstract"]
You can assign content view environments to a host by using Hammer CLI.
A host must always have at least one content view environment assigned.

To assign content view environments to a host, specify the entire list in order.
There is no interface in Hammer or the API to add, remove, or insert individual content view environments.
The current content view environments on the host are replaced with the new list you provide.

.Prerequisites
* If you want to assign multiple content view environments, the *Allow multiple content views* setting must be enabled.
For more information, see xref:content-view-environments-overview[].

.Procedure
. List available content view environments in your organization:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
$ hammer content-view-environment list --organization _"My_Organization"_
----
+
Record the labels of the environments you want to assign to the host.
. Assign the content view environments to the host:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
$ hammer host update \
--content-view-environments="Library/along_cv,LCE_XYZ/CV1" \
--name "{server-example-com}" \
--organization-id _My_Organization_ID_

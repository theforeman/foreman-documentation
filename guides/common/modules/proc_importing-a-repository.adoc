= Importing a Repository

You can use the archive that the `hammer content-export` command outputs to import a repository in another organization.
For more information about exporting content of a repository, see xref:Exporting_a_Repository_{context}[].

.Prerequisites

To import a repository to an Organization's library lifecycle environment ensure that {ProjectServer} on which you want to import, meets the following conditions:

* The export files must be in a directory under `/var/lib/pulp/imports`.
* The directory must have `pulp:pulp` ownership so that Pulp can read and write the `.json` files in that directory.
* If the export contains any Red Hat repositories, the manifest of the importing organization must contain subscriptions for the products contained within the export.
* The user importing the content must have the _Content Importer_ Role.

.Procedure
. Copy the export files to the `/var/lib/pulp/imports` directory on {ProjectServer} where you want to import.
. Set the ownership of the export files to `pulp:pulp`.

. On {ProjectServer} where you want to import, create/enable a repository with the same name and label as the exported content.
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Content* > *Products*.
. Click the *Yum content* tab.
. Add the same `Yum` content that the exported Content View version includes.
. Identify the Organization that you wish to import into.
. To import the Library content to {ProjectServer}, enter the following command:

# hammer content-import repository \
--organization="_My_Organization_" \
--path=/var/lib/pulp/imports/_2021-03-02T03-35-24-00-00_

Note that you must enter the full path `/var/lib/pulp/imports/_My_Exported_Repo_Dir_`.
Relative paths do not work.
. To verify that you imported the repository, check the contents of the Product and Repository.

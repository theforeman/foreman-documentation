= Importing a Repository

You can import an exported repository into an organization on another {ProjectServer}.
For more information about exporting content of a repository, see xref:Exporting_a_Repository_{context}[].

.Prerequisites
* The export files must be in a directory under `/var/lib/pulp/imports`.
* If the export contains any Red Hat repositories, the manifest of the importing organization must contain subscriptions for the products contained within the export.
* The user importing the content must have the _Content Importer_ Role.

.Procedure
. Copy the exported files to a subdirectory of `/var/lib/pulp/imports` on {ProjectServer} where you want to import.
. Set the ownership of the import directory and its contents to `pulp:pulp`.

Note that you must enter the full path `/var/lib/pulp/imports/_My_Exported_Repo_Dir_`.
Relative paths do not work.
. To verify that you imported the repository, check the contents of the Product and Repository.

= Assigning multiple content view environments to activation keys

You can assign multiple content view environments to an activation key to provide hosts with access to content from each assigned environment.
Hosts registered with the activation key receive the environments in the order they are stored, allowing for structured content assignment from multiple content view environments.
The content view environments available in your organization fall into the following categories:

. *Library environment*:
The system assigns the Library environment to represent the Library lifecycle environment and the *Default Organization View* content view.

. *Unpromoted content views*:
For each content view that you publish but do not promote to a lifecycle environment, the system creates a content view environment.
The system labels these environments using the format: `Library/<content_view_label>`.

. *Promoted content views*:
For each content view that you promote to a specific lifecycle environment, the system creates a corresponding content view environment.
The system labels these environments using the format: `<lifecycle_environment_label>/<content_view_label>`.

.CLI Procedure

. Run the `hammer content-view-environment list` command to obtain the labels of the content view environments you want to use.
. Use the following command to create an activation key and assign multiple content view environments:

= Configuring the Open Files Limit for Apache HTTPD

With the tuning in place, Apache httpd can easily open a lot of file descriptors on the server which may exceed the default limit of most of the linux systems in place.
To avoid any kind of issues that may arise as a result of exceeding max open files limit on the system, please create the following file and directory and set the contents of the file as specified in the below given example:

.Procedure
. Set the maximum open files limit in `/etc/systemd/system/httpd.service.d/limits.conf`:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
[Service]
LimitNOFILE=640000
----
. Restart the {Project} services:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# systemctl daemon-reload
# {foreman-maintain} service restart
----

= Importing a Content View Version from a web server

You can import an exported Content View version directly from a web server to create a version with the same content in an organization on another {ProjectServer}.
For more information about exporting a Content View version, see xref:Exporting_a_Content_View_Version_{context}[].

When you import a Content View version, it has the same major and minor version numbers and contains the same repositories with the same packages and errata.
Custom repositories, products, and Content Views are automatically created if they do not exist in the importing organization.

= Host Sub-status Overview

A sub-status monitors only part of a host's capabilities.

Currently, {Project} ships only with *Build* and *Configuration* sub-statuses.
There can be more sub-statuses depending on which plugins you add to your {Project}.

The *build* sub-status is relevant for managed hosts and when {Project} runs in unattended mode.

The *configuration* sub-status is only relevant if {Project} uses a configuration management system like Ansible, Puppet, or Salt.

To view the sub-status for a host, in the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Hosts* > *All Hosts* and click the host whose full status you want to inspect.
You can also view substatus information in the hover help for each host.

In the *Properties* table of the host details' page, you can view both the global host status and all sub-statuses.

Each sub-status can define its own set of possible values that are mapped to the three global status values.

The *Build* sub-status has two possible values - *pending* and *built* that are both mapped to global *OK* value.

The *Configuration* status has more possible values that map to the global status as follows:

.sub-statuses that map to the global *OK* status

Active::
During the last run, some resources were applied.

Pending::
During the last run, some resources would be applied but your configuration management integration was configured to run in `noop` mode.

No changes::
During the last run, nothing changed.

No reports::
This can be both a *Warning* or *OK* sub-status.
This occurs when there are no reports but the host uses, for example, an associated configuration management proxy or `always_show_configuration_status` setting is set to `true`, it maps to *Warning*.

.Sub-status that maps to the global *Error* status

Error::
This indicates an error during configuration, for example, a run failed to install a package.

.sub-statuses that map to the global *Warning* status

Out of sync::
A configuration report was not received within the expected interval, based on the `outofsync_interval`.
Reports are identified by an origin and can have different intervals based upon it.

No reports::
When your host uses a configuration management system but {Project} does not receive reports, it maps to *Warning*.
Otherwise it is mapped to OK.

.Search syntax
If you want to search for hosts according to their sub-status, use the syntax for searching in {Project} that is outlined in the {AdministeringDocURL}Searching_and_Bookmarking_admin[Searching and Bookmarking] chapter of the _Administering {Project}_ guide, and then build your searches out using the following status-related examples:

You search for hosts' configuration sub-statuses based on their last reported state.

For example, to find hosts that have at least one pending resource:

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
status.pending > 0
----

To find hosts that restarted some service during last run:

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
status.restarted > 0
----

To find hosts that have an interesting last run that might indicate something has happened:

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
status.interesting = true
----

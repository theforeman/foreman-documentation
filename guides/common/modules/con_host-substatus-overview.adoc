= Host Sub-status Overview

A sub-status monitors only a part of a host's capabilities.

To view the sub-statuses of a host, in the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Hosts* > *All Hosts* and click on the host whose full status you want to inspect.
You can view the global host status next to the name of the host and the host sub-statuses on the *Host status* card.

Each sub-status has its own set of possible values that are mapped to the three global status values.

Below are listed sub-statuses that {Project} contains.
ifdef::foreman-el,foreman-deb,katello[]
There can be more sub-statuses depending on which plug-ins you add to your {Project}.
endif::[]

Configuration::
This sub-status is only relevant if {Project} uses a configuration management system like Ansible, Puppet, or Salt.
+
Possible values:
+
[options="header"]
|===
| Label | Global host status
| Alerts disabled | OK
| Active | OK
| Pending | OK
| No changes | OK
| No reports | OK / Warning
| Out of sync | Warning
| Error | Error
|===
+
Additional information about the values of this sub-status:
+
* *Active*: During the last configuration, some resources were applied.
* *Pending*: During the last configuration, some resources would be applied but your configuration management integration was configured to run in `noop` mode.
* *No changes*: During the last configuration, nothing changed.
* *No reports*: This can be both a *Warning* or *OK* status.
When there are no reports but the host uses an associated {SmartProxy} for configuration management or the `always_show_configuration_status` setting is set to `true`, it maps to *Warning*.
Otherwise it maps to *OK*.
* *Error*: This indicates an error during configuration.
For example, a configuration run failed to install a package.
* *Out of sync*: A configuration report was not received within the expected interval, based on the `outofsync_interval` setting.
Reports are identified by an origin and can have different intervals based upon it.

.Search syntax
If you want to search for hosts according to their sub-status, use the syntax for searching in {Project} that is outlined in the {AdministeringDocURL}Searching_and_Bookmarking_admin[Searching and Bookmarking] chapter of the _Administering {Project}_ guide, and then build your searches out using the following status-related examples:

You search for hosts' configuration sub-statuses based on their last reported state.

For example, to find hosts that have at least one pending resource:

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
status.pending > 0
----

To find hosts that restarted some service during last run:

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
status.restarted > 0
----

To find hosts that have an interesting last run that might indicate something has happened:

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
status.interesting = true
----

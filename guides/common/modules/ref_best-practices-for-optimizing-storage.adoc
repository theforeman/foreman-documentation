= Best practices for optimizing storage

Consider the following storage guidelines for increased storage efficiency:

* The exact amount of storage you require for log messages depends on your installation and setup.
You can manage the size of the log files by using *logrotate*.
* Consider mounting `/var` on LVM storage.
This can help the system to scale because most {ProductName} data is stored in the `/var` directory.
* Use high-bandwidth, low-latency storage for the `/var/lib/pulp/` and `{postgresql-lib-dir}` directories.
Using high latency, low-bandwidth storage causes performance degradation because {ProjectName} has many operations that are I/O intensive.
* Use a file system with low input-output latency.
Do not use the GFS2 file system because the input-output latency is too high.

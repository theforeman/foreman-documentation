= Host Global Status Overview

The global status represents the overall status of a particular host.
The status can have one of three possible values: *OK*, *Warning*, or *Error*.
You can find global status on the Hosts Overview page.
The status displays a small icon next to host name and has a color that corresponds with the status.
Hovering over the icon renders a tooltip with sub-status information to quickly find out more details.
To view the global status for a host, in the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Hosts* > *All Hosts*.

OK::
No errors were reported by any sub-status.
This status is highlighted with the color green.

Warning::
While no error was detected, some sub-status raised a warning.
For example, there are no configuration management reports for the host even though the host is configured to send reports.
It is a good practice to investigate any warnings to ensure that your deployment remains healthy.
This status is highlighted with the color yellow.

Error::
Some sub-status reports a failure.
For example, a run contains some failed resources.
This status is highlighted with the color red.

.Search syntax
If you want to search for hosts according to their status, use the syntax for searching in {Project} that is outlined in the {AdministeringDocURL}chap-Administering-Searching_and_Bookmarking[Searching and Bookmarking] chapter of the _Administering {Project}_ guide, and then build your searches out using the following status-related examples:

To search for hosts that have an *OK* status:

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
global_status = ok
----

To search for all hosts that deserve attention:

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
global_status = error or global_status = warning
----

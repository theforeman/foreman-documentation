= Host global status overview

[role="_abstract"]
The global status represents the overall status of a particular host.

The status can have one of three possible values: *OK*, *Warning*, or *Error*.
You can find global status on the Hosts Overview page.
The status displays a small icon next to host name and has a color that corresponds with the status.
Hovering over the icon renders a tooltip with sub-status information to quickly find out more details.
To view the global status for a host, in the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Hosts* > *All Hosts*.

OK::
No errors were reported by any sub-status.
This status is highlighted with the color green.

Warning::
While no error was detected, some sub-status raised a warning.
For example, there are no configuration management reports for the host even though the host is configured to send reports.
It is a good practice to investigate any warnings to ensure that your deployment remains healthy.
This status is highlighted with the color yellow.

Error::
Some sub-status reports a failure.
For example, a run contains some failed resources.
This status is highlighted with the color red.

If you want to search for hosts according to their status, use the syntax for searching in {Project} that is outlined in the {AdministeringDocURL}Searching_and_Bookmarking_admin[Searching and Bookmarking] in _{AdministeringDocTitle}_, and then build your searches out by using the following status-related examples:

To search for hosts that have an *OK* status:

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
global_status = ok
----

To search for all hosts that deserve attention:

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
global_status = error or global_status = warning
----

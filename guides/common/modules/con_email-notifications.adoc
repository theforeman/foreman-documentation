[id="Email_Notifications_{context}"]
= Email Notifications

Email notifications are created by {ProjectServer} periodically or after completion of certain events.
The periodic notifications can be sent daily, weekly or monthly.

The events that trigger a notification are the following:

* Host build
* Content View promotion
* Error reported by host
* Repository sync

Users do not receive any email notifications by default.
An administrator can configure users to receive notifications based on criteria such as the type of notification, and frequency.

[NOTE]
====
If you want email notifications sent to a group's email address, instead of an individual's email address, create a user account with the group's email address and minimal {Project} permissions, then subscribe the user account to the desired notification types.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
{ProjectServer} does not enable outgoing emails by default, therefore you must review your email configuration.
For more information, see {InstallingServerDocURL}Configuring_Server_for_Outgoing_Emails_{project-context}[Configuring {ProjectServer} for Outgoing Emails] in _{InstallingServerDocTitle}_.

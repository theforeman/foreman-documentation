= Excluding hosts from {Insights} reporting

[role="_abstract"]
You can exclude hosts from {Insights} reporting by changing the values of certain host parameters.

You can use the following parameters:

* `host_registration_insights` {endash} setting it to `false` will block the {Insights} client on the host from uploading a report to the {RHCloud}
* `host_registration_insights_inventory` {endash} setting it to `false` will exclude the host from the {Insights} inventory report upload to the {RHCloud}

If you exclude a host that is already reported on the https://console.redhat.com/[Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console], it will be still removed automatically from the inventory.
However, this process can take some time to complete.

You can set these parameters at any level.
For more information, see xref:Host_Parameter_Hierarchy_managing-hosts[].

= Deleting Task Records

Task records are created automatically in {Project}.
You can use the `foreman-rake foreman_tasks:cleanup` command to remove tasks at any time.
You can also use a cron job to schedule Task record deletions at the set interval that you want.

For example, if you want to delete task records from successful repository synchronizations, enter the following command:

----
# foreman-rake foreman_tasks:cleanup TASK_SEARCH='label = Actions::Katello::Repository::Sync' STATES='stopped'
----

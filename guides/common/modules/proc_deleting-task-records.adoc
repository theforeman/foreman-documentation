[id="Deleting_Task_Records_{context}"]
= Deleting task records

Task records are created automatically in {Project}.
You can use the `foreman-rake foreman_tasks:cleanup` command to remove tasks at any time.
You can also use a cron job to schedule Task record deletions at the set interval that you want.

For example, you can delete task records from successful repository synchronizations:

----
# foreman-rake foreman_tasks:cleanup TASK_SEARCH='label = Actions::Katello::Repository::Sync' STATES='stopped'
----

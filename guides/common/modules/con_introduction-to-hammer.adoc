= Introduction to Hammer

Hammer is a powerful command-line tool provided with {ProjectNameX}.
You can use Hammer to configure and manage a {ProjectServer} either through CLI commands or automation in shell scripts.
Hammer also provides an interactive shell.

.Hammer compared to {ProjectWebUI}

Compared to navigating the {ProjectWebUI}, using Hammer can result in much faster interaction with the {ProjectServer}, as common shell features such as environment variables and aliases are at your disposal.
You can also incorporate Hammer commands into reusable scripts for automating tasks of various complexity.
Output from Hammer commands can be redirected to other tools, which allows for integration with your existing environment.
You can issue Hammer commands directly on the base operating system running {ProjectName}.

Access to base operating system on {ProjectServer} is required to issue Hammer commands, which can limit the number of potential users compared to the {ProjectWebUI}.
Although the parity between Hammer and the {ProjectWebUI} is almost complete, the {ProjectWebUI} has development priority and can be ahead especially for newly introduced features.

.Hammer compared to {Project} API

For many tasks, both Hammer and {Project} API are equally applicable.
Hammer can be used as a human friendly interface to {Project} API, for example to test responses to API calls before applying them in a script (use the `-d` option to inspect API calls issued by Hammer, for example `hammer -d organization list`).
Changes in the API are automatically reflected in Hammer, while scripts using the API directly have to be updated manually.

In the background, each Hammer command first establishes a binding to the API, then sends a request.
This can have performance implications when executing a large number of Hammer commands in sequence.
In contrast, a script communicating directly with the API establishes the binding only once.

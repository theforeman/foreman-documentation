= Activation keys and content access

[role="_abstract"]
Activation keys can simplify the workflow for some of the content access strategies.

You can use activation keys to perform the following actions:

* Assign hosts to content view environments.
* Add content overrides to hosts.
* Set system purpose attributes on hosts, including a release version.

Activation keys only affect hosts during registration.
If a host is already registered, the content access can be changed individually for each host or through content host bulk actions.

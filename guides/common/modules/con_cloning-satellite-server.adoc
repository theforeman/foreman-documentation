= Cloning {ProjectServer}

You can clone your {ProjectServer} to create instances to test upgrades and migration of instances to a different machine or operating system.
This is an optional step to provide more flexibility during the upgrade or migration.

You cannot use the {Project} clone tool on a {SmartProxyServer}.
Instead, you must backup the existing {SmartProxyServer}, restore it on the target server, and then reconfigure {SmartProxyServer}.

[NOTE]
====
If you create a new instance of the {ProjectServer}, decommission the old instances after restoring the backup.
Cloned instances are not supposed to run in parallel in a production environment.

You configure virt-who by creating a virt-who configuration on {ProjectServer}.
Then, you deploy the configuration on a target host such as a hypervisor or a dedicated {EL} server.

.Prerequisites
* A subscription manifest that includes a host-based subscription is imported into {ProjectServer}.
* The target host is registered to {ProjectServer}.
* A read-only user for virt-who is created on the target host.

.Procedure
. Create a virt-who configuration on {ProjectServer}.
. Deploy the virt-who configuration on the target host.

.Next steps
* Set the system purpose attributes of the host to improve the accuracy of the subscriptions service data.

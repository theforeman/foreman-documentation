[id="Deploying_a_Policy_in_a_Host_Group_Using_Puppet_{context}"]
= Deploying a policy in a host group using Puppet

After you deploy a compliance policy in a host group using Puppet, the Puppet agent installs the SCAP client and configures OpenSCAP scans on the hosts on the next Puppet run according to the selected compliance policy.

The SCAP content in your compliance policy might require remote resources.

= Considerations for performance tuning

[role="_abstract"]
In following sections we suggest various tunables and how to apply them.
Always test changing tunables in non production environment first, with valid backup and with proper outage window because most cases require {Project} restart.

It is also a good practice to setup a monitoring before applying any change as it will allow you to evaluate effect of the change.
Our testing environment might be too far from what you will see although we are trying hard to mimic real world environment.

Optional: After any change, run this quick {Project} health check:

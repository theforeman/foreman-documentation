= Scenarios for {Project} on AWS

You can deploy {Project} on Amazon Web Services (AWS) in several scenarios.

.One-region setup
This is the least complex configuration of {Project} in AWS.
Deploy both {ProjectServer} and the hosts residing within the same region and within the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
You can also use a different availability zone.

.Connecting on-premises and AWS region
Create a VPN connection between the on-premises location and the AWS region where your {SmartProxyServer} is located.
It is also possible to use the external host name of {ProjectServer} when you register the instance that runs {SmartProxy}.

*Site-to-site VPN connection between the AWS region and the on-premises data center*

*Direct connection using the external DNS host name*

endif::[]

.Connecting different regions
Create a site-to-site VPN connection between different regions so that you can use the internal DNS host name when you register the instance that runs {SmartProxy} to {ProjectServer}.
If you do not establish a site-to-site VPN connection, use the external DNS host name when you register the instance that runs {SmartProxy} to {ProjectServer}.

[NOTE]
====
Most public cloud providers do not charge for data being transferred into a region or between availability zones within a single region.
However, they charge for data leaving the region to the Internet.

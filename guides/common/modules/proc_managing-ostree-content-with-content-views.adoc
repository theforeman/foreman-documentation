= Managing OSTree Content with Content Views

Use Content Views to manage OSTree branches across the application life cycle.
This process uses the same publication and promotion method as RPMs or Puppet modules.

.Prerequisite
* You have created a Product and added an OSTree repository to it.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Content* > *Content Views* and click *Create New View*.
. In the *Name* field, enter a plain text name for the view.
This automatically populates the *Label* field.
. In the *Description* field, enter a description of the OSTree Content View.
. If you want to use a Composite Content View, select the *Composite View* checkbox.
. Optional: If you want to solve dependencies automatically every time you publish this Content View, select the *Solve Dependencies* checkbox. Dependency solving slows the publishing time and might ignore any Content View filters you use.
. Optional: If this Content View is for importing from an upstream server only, select the *Import only* checkbox.
You cannot publish import-only Content Views directly.
. Click *Save* to complete.
. Navigate to the *Repositories* tab.
. Select the OSTree repository that you want to use.
Click *Add Repository* to add the OSTree content from this repository to the Content View.
. Click *Publish new version*.
. Optional: In the *Description* field, enter a description for the version.
. Optional: Enable the *Promote* switch to promote this Content View across environments in the application life cycle.
. Click *Next*.
. Review details and click *Finish*.

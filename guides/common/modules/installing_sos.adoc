You should install the *sos* package on the host operating system. The *sos* package enables you to collect configuration and diagnostic information from a Red Hat Enterprise Linux system. You can also use it to provide the initial system analysis, which is required when opening a service request with Red Hat Technical Support. For more information on using sos, see the Knowledgebase solution https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3592[What is a sosreport and how to create one in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.6 and later?] on the Red{nbsp}Hat Customer Portal.

Install the *sos* package.

[role="_abstract"]
Simple Content Access (SCA) is a subscription model that simplifies the management of content provided by Red{nbsp}Hat repositories.
Learn how SCA works in {Project}.

Simple Content Access (SCA) in {Project} simplifies management of software entitlements.
With SCA, you can add new valid subscriptions to a subscription allocation or manifest and refresh within Satellite.
Therefore, with SCA enabled, you do not need to attach subscriptions individually to managed hosts.

NOTE: Simple Content Access (SCA) replaces the previous entitlement-based method of subscription management. New organizations default to having SCA enabled. Entitlement-based subscription management is deprecated. See 
{ReleaseNotesDocURL}[_{ReleaseNotesDocTitle}_] for details.

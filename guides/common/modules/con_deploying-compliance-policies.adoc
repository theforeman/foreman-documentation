= Deploying compliance policies

[role="_abstract"]
To deploy a compliance policy, you must install the SCAP client, update the cron schedule file, and upload the SCAP content selected in the policy onto a host.
You specify the schedule for scans on {Project} and the scans are performed on hosts.

When a scan completes, a report in ARF format is generated and uploaded to {Project}.
A compliance policy scan makes no changes to hosts.

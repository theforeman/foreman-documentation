= Migrating {Project} or {SmartProxy} to {EL-abbr}{nbsp}9 using backup and restore

You can migrate your existing {ProjectServer} and {SmartProxyServer} from {EL}{nbsp}8 to a freshly installed {EL}{nbsp}9 system.

.Procedure
. Perform a full backup of your {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxy}.
This is the source {EL}{nbsp}8 server that you are migrating.
For more information, see {AdministeringDocURL}backing-up-{project-context}-server-and-{smart-proxy-context}_admin#Performing_a_Full_Backup_admin[Performing a full backup of {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer}] in _{AdministeringDocTitle}_.
. Deploy a system with {EL}{nbsp}9 and the same hostname and configuration as the source server.
This is the target server.
ifdef::satellite[]
. Restore the backup.
Restore does not significantly alter the target system and requires additional configuration.

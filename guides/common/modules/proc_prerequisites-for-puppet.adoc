There are the following requirements to run the Puppet agent on managed hosts:

ifdef::katello,satellite,orcharhino[]
. Enable Puppet integration in your {Project}.
For more information, see xref:Enabling_Puppet_Integration_{context}[].
endif::[]
. Sync the Puppet agent from https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/6.21/install_puppet.html#enable_the_puppet_platform_repository[puppet.com].
For example, https://yum.puppet.com/puppet6/el/7/x86_64/[Puppet 6 for CentOS 7 on x86_64] or https://apt.puppet.com/[Puppet 6 for Ubuntu 20.04] with release `focal`, component `puppet6`, and architecture `amd64`.

Manage these repositories by using products, sync plans, content views, composite content views, and lifecycle environments.
ifdef::katello[]
For more information, see {ContentManagementDocURL}basic-content-management-workflow[basic content management workflow] in the _Content Management Guide_.
endif::[]
. Provide the Puppet agent to the managed host using their activation key.
. Add either `enable-puppet5` or `enable-puppet6` as parameter to your host or host group.
Set the parameter type to `boolean` and its value to `true`.
. Set a Puppet environment, Puppet server, and Puppet CA when provisioning a host.

Continue either with xref:Installing_and_Configuring_the_Puppet_Agent_{context}[installing the Puppet agent manually]
or by using the `puppet_setup` snippet to xref:Installing_Puppet_Agent_during_Host_Provisioning_{context}[install the Puppet agent automatically during provisioning].

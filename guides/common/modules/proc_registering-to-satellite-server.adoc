This procedure is only for Katello users.

Use this procedure to register the base operating system on which you want to install {SmartProxyServer} to {ProjectServer}.

.Prerequisites
Before registering it to {ProjectServer}, ensure that the base operating system on which you want to install {SmartProxy} meets the following conditions:

.Subscription Manifest Prerequisites
* On {ProjectServer}, a manifest must be installed and it must contain the appropriate repositories for the organization you want {SmartProxy} to belong to.
* The manifest must contain repositories for the base operating system on which you want to install {SmartProxy}, as well as any clients that you want to connect to {SmartProxy}.
* The repositories must be synchronized.

For more information on manifests and repositories, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_satellite/{ProductVersion}/html/content_management_guide/managing_subscriptions/[Managing Subscriptions] in the _{ProjectName} Content Management Guide_.

.Proxy and Network Prerequisites
* The {ProjectServer} base operating system must be able to resolve the host name of the {SmartProxy} base operating system and vice versa.
ifeval::["{build}" != "foreman-deb"]
* The base operating system on which you want to install {SmartProxyServer} must not be configured to use a proxy to connect to the Red Hat CDN.
endif::[]
* You must configure the host and network-based firewalls accordingly. For more information, see xref:capsule-ports-and-firewalls-requirements_{smart-proxy-context}[].
* You must have a {ProjectServer} user name and password. For more information, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_satellite/{ProductVersion}/html/administering_red_hat_satellite/chap-red_hat_satellite-administering_red_hat_satellite-configuring_external_authentication[Configuring External Authentication] in _Administering {ProjectName}_.

.Procedure
To register your system to {ProjectServer}, complete the following steps:

. Download the `katello-ca-consumer-latest.noarch.rpm` package on the base operating system on which you want to install {SmartProxy}. The consumer RPM configures the host to download content from the content source that is specified in {Project}.

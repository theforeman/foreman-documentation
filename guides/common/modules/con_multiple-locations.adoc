Create at least one {SmartProxyServer} per geographic location to save bandwidth by having hosts obtain content locally.
Only your {SmartProxyServer} synchronizes content from remote repositories, making your provisioning infrastructure more reliable and easier to configure.

{Team} recommends to create at least one {SmartProxyServer} per geographic location.
This practice can save bandwidth since hosts obtain content from a local {SmartProxyServer}.
Synchronization of content from remote repositories is done only by the {SmartProxy}, not by each host in a location.
In addition, this layout makes the provisioning infrastructure more reliable and easier to configure.

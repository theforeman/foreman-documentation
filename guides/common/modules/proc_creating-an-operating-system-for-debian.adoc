[CAUTION]
====
{Project} searches for the boot files in the installation medium depending on the major and minor version of the operating system.
Ensure to enter both the major and minor version correctly.

For example, for {os_name} {os_major}, set the major field to `{os_major}` and leave the minor field empty.
For example, for {os_name} {os_major}.{os_minor}, set the major field to `{os_major}` and the minor field to `{os_minor}`.

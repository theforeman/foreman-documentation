= Working with lifecycle environments

{Project} divides application life cycles into lifecycle environments, which represent each stage of the application life cycle.
Lifecycle environments are linked to from an environment path.
To create linked lifecycle environments with the API, use the `prior_id` parameter.

You can find the built-in API reference for lifecycle environments at `https://_{foreman-example-com}_/apidoc/v2/lifecycle_environments.html`.
The API routes include `/katello/api/environments` and `/katello/api/organizations/:organization_id/environments`.

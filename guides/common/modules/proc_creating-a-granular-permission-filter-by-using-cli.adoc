= Creating a granular permission filter by using Hammer CLI

[role="_abstract"]
Use this procedure to create a granular filter by using Hammer CLI.

{Project} does not apply search conditions to create actions.
For example, limiting the _create_locations_ action with _name = "Default Location"_ expression in the search field does not prevent the user from assigning a custom name to the newly created location.

.Procedure

* To create a granular filter, enter the `hammer filter create` command with the `--search` option to limit permission filters, for example:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
$ hammer filter create \
--permission-ids 91 \
--search "name ~ ccv*" \
--role qa-user
----
+
This command adds to the *qa-user* role a permission to view, create, edit, and destroy content views that only applies to content views with name starting with `ccv`.

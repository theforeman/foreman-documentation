= Introduction to {Project} API

[role="_abstract"]
{ProjectName} provides a Representational State Transfer (REST) API.
The API provides software developers and system administrators with control over their {ProjectName} environment outside of the standard web interface.
The REST API is useful for developers and administrators who aim to integrate the functionality of {ProjectName} with custom scripts or external applications that access the API over HTTP.

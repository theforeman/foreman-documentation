= Bootloader Binary Location

This section describes how {Project} manages and serves bootloader binaries through the *{SmartProxy}*, which provides the underlying network boot services used during automated host provisioning.
While traditional *PXE (Preboot Execution Environment)* remains a core method, {Project} also supports *HTTPBoot*, *iPXE*, and *UEFI HTTP(S) Boot* mechanisms.

During a network-based installation, {SmartProxy} coordinates multiple services:

* DHCP: Assigns IP addresses and provides the bootloader filename and `next-server` information.

* TFTP: Delivers bootloaders such as PXELinux, GRUB, or iPXE binaries to clients.

* HTTP(S): Serves bootloaders and installation images via the {SmartProxy}’s HTTPBoot module.

When a host begins a network boot, it retrieves the appropriate bootloader (for example, `pxelinux.0`, `grubx64.efi`, or `ipxe.efi`) according to its firmware type and *PXE Loader* setting in {Project}.
The bootloader then loads {Project}-generated configuration files that define which kernel and initrd to boot, initiating the OS installation process.

The *{SmartProxy}* manages the distribution of these bootloader binaries and configuration files.
All bootloaders, whether used for PXE, iPXE, or HTTPBoot, are stored under the {SmartProxy}’s TFTP root directory (`/var/lib/tftpboot/`), which is also shared by the HTTPBoot service.
Each bootloader binary is organized within a directory structure based on its type, architecture, and operating system version.

[NOTE]
====
The TFTP root directory is configured in `/etc/foreman-proxy/settings.d/tftp.yml` under the `:tftproot` parameter.
In this document, the default path `/var/lib/tftpboot` is used for explanation.
If your environment uses a different path, please substitute it accordingly.

The directory used by *Grub2 UEFI HTTP* and *iPXE HTTP* for file delivery is defined in `/etc/foreman-proxy/settings.d/httpboot.yml` under the `:root_dir` parameter.
This also defaults to `/var/lib/tftpboot`.
If you have customized this setting, read the descriptions in this section using your configured directory path instead.

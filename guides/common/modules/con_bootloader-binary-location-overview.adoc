= Boot loader management and file structure

[role="_abstract"]
{Project} manages and serves boot loader binaries through the *{SmartProxy}*, which provides the network boot services used during automated host provisioning.
{Project} supports PXE boot for BIOS and UEFI firmware on various architectures utilizing TFTP or HTTP(S).

During a network-based installation, {SmartProxy} coordinates the following services:

DHCP:: Assigns IP addresses and provides the boot loader filename and server information.

TFTP:: Delivers boot loaders such as PXELinux, Grub2, or iPXE binaries to clients.

HTTP(S):: Serves boot loaders and installation files via the {SmartProxy}’s HTTPBoot module.

When a host begins a network boot, it retrieves the appropriate boot loader (for example, `pxelinux.0`, `grubx64.efi`, or `ipxe.efi`) according to the *PXE Loader* option in {Project}.
The boot loader then loads {Project}-generated configuration files that define which kernel and initrd to boot, initiating the OS installation process.

The *{SmartProxy}* manages the distribution of these boot loader binaries and their configuration files.
All boot loaders are stored under the {SmartProxy}’s TFTP root directory (`/var/lib/tftpboot/`), which is also shared by the HTTPBoot service.

By default, boot loader binaries are placed directly under service-specific directories such as `grub2/`  
(for example, `/var/lib/tftpboot/grub2/grubx64.efi`).

If the *bootloader-universe* structure is enabled, boot loaders are instead organized into a hierarchy based on type, architecture, and operating system version.

[NOTE]
====
The TFTP root directory is configured in `/etc/foreman-proxy/settings.d/tftp.yml` under the `:tftproot` parameter.
The default path is `/var/lib/tftpboot`.

The directory used by *Grub2 UEFI HTTP* and *iPXE HTTP* for file delivery is defined in `/etc/foreman-proxy/settings.d/httpboot.yml` under the `:root_dir` parameter.
The default path is also `/var/lib/tftpboot`.

This document uses the default paths.
If your environment uses a different path, replace the default paths with your custom paths.

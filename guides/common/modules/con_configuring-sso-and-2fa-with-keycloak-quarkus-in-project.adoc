= Configuring SSO and 2FA with {keycloak-quarkus} in {Project}

[role="_abstract"]
{keycloak-quarkus} is an open-source identity and access management solution that provides authentication features, such as single sign-on functionality, user federation, and centralized authentication management.
With {keycloak-quarkus}, you can integrate {ProjectServer} with your existing {keycloak-quarkus} server to delegate user authentication and authorization to {keycloak-quarkus}.

{keycloak} users can log in using the following login methods:

* User name and password in {ProjectWebUI}
* User name and password in Hammer CLI

[NOTE]
====
{keycloak} users cannot use both {ProjectWebUI} and Hammer CLI authentication in {Project} at the same time.
====

* Time-based one-time password (TOTP), an implementation of two-factor authentication (2FA)

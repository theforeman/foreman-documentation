= Installing a Puppet module on {Project} server

[role="_abstract"]
You can install a pre-built Puppet module from the Puppet Forge.
Alternatively, you can install a private Puppet module that is not available on the Puppet Forge by manually coping the module to your {ProjectServer}.

The Puppet Forge is a repository that provides Puppet modules contributed by the community.
Puppet modules flagged as _supported_ are officially supported and tested by Puppet Inc.

.Procedure
. Navigate to https://forge.puppet.com/[forge.puppet.com] and search for the Puppet module you want.
. Choose how to install the Puppet module:
* To install from the Puppet forge, install the Puppet module on your {ProjectServer}:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
# puppet module install _My_Puppet_Module_ -i /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules
----
+
Use the `-i` parameter to specify the path and Puppet environment, for example `production`.
+
Once the installation is completed, the output looks as follows:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]

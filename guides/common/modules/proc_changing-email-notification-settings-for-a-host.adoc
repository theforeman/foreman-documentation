[id="Changing_Email_Notifications_for_a_Host_{context}"]
= Changing email notification settings for a host

[role="_abstract"]
{Project} can send event notifications for a host to the host's registered owner.
You can configure {Project} to send email notifications either to an individual user or a user group.
When set to a user group, all group members who are subscribed to the email type receive a message.

Receiving email notifications for a host can be useful, but also overwhelming if you are expecting to receive frequent errors, for example, because of a known issue or error you are working around.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Hosts* > *All Hosts*, locate the host that you want to view, and click *Edit* in the *Actions* column.
. Go to the *Additional Information* tab.
If the checkbox *Include this host within {Project} reporting* is checked, then the email notifications are enabled on that host.
. Optional: Toggle the checkbox to enable or disable the email notifications.

[NOTE]
====
If you want to receive email notifications, ensure that you have an email address set in your user settings.

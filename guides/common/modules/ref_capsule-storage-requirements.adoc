The size of the PostgreSQL database on your {SmartProxyServer} can grow significantly with an increasing number of lifecycle environments, content views, or repositories that are synchronized from your {ProjectServer}.
In the largest {Project} environments, the size of `{postgresql-lib-dir}` on {SmartProxyServer} can grow to double or triple the size of `{postgresql-lib-dir}` on your {ProjectServer}.

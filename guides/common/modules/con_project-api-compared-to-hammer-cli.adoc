= {Project} API compared to Hammer CLI

For many tasks, you can use both Hammer and {Project} API.
You can use Hammer as a human-friendly interface to {Project} API.
For example, to test responses to API calls before applying them in a script, use the `--debug` option to inspect API calls that Hammer issues: `hammer --debug organization list`.
In contrast, scripts that use API commands communicate directly with the {Project} API.

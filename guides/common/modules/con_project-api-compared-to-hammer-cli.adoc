= {Project} API compared to Hammer CLI

[role="_abstract"]
For many tasks, you can use both Hammer and {Project} API.
In these situations, you can choose whether Hammer or {Project} API is the more suitable tool for your use case.

You can use Hammer as a human-friendly interface to {Project} API.
For example, to test responses to API calls before applying them in a script, use the `--debug` option to inspect API calls that Hammer issues: `hammer --debug organization list`.

In the background, each Hammer command first establishes a binding to the API, then sends a request.
This can have performance implications when executing a large number of Hammer commands in sequence.
In contrast, a script communicating directly with the API establishes the binding only once.

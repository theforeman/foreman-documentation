= Setting the Provisioning Context

When you set a provisioning context, you define which organization and location to use for provisioning hosts.

The organization and location menus are located in the menu bar, on the upper left of the {Project} web UI.
If you have not selected an organization and location to use, the menu displays: *Any Organization* and *Any Location*.

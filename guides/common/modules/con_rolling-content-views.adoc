= Rolling content views

[role="_abstract"]
A rolling content view is a curated subset of content that your hosts can access.
It is a subset of the Library environment and contains the latest synchronized content from one or multiple repositories.
You can use a rolling content view to provide a continuous stream of synchronized content to hosts.

When you synchronize repositories to {Project}, all rolling content views that contain them get automatically updated to include the latest changes.
You do not have to publish and/or promote a rolling content view compared to content views or composite content views.

Instead, you can assign rolling content views to one or multiple lifecycle environments.
This allows you to control which content is synchronized from {ProjectServer} to {SmartProxyServers}.

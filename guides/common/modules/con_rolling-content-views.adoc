= Rolling content views

A rolling content view is a curated subset of content that your hosts can access.
It is a subset of the Library environment and contains the latest synchronized content from one or multiple repositories.
You can use a rolling content view to provide a continuous stream of synchronized content to hosts.

When you synchronize repositories to {Project}, all rolling content views that contain them get automatically updated to include the latest changes.
You do not have to publish and/or promote a rolling content view compared to content views or composite content views.

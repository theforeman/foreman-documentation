= Generating a Containerfile command with transient packages

[role="_abstract"]
You can generate a Containerfile command with transient packages to install the packages in your container image.
Then, you can use this command to rebuild your image to make the packages persistent.
This command is also available from Hammer CLI and {Project} API.

= Configuring {ProjectServer} with external database

Running the `{foreman-installer}` command, used to install a {ProjectServer}, also installs PostgreSQL databases on the server.
However, you can configure your {ProjectServer} to use external databases instead.
Moving to external databases distributes the workload and can reduce overall {Project} memory usage.

[NOTE]
====
Red{nbsp}Hat does not provide support or tools for external database maintenance.
If you deploy {Project} with external databases, you will need to support and maintain the external databases yourself.

Consider using external databases if you plan to use your {Project} deployment for the following scenarios:

* Frequent remote execution tasks.
This requires a high volume of records in PostgreSQL and generates heavy database workloads.
ifdef::katello,orcharhino,satellite[]
* High disk I/O workloads from frequent repository synchronization or content view publishing.
This requires {Project} to create a record in PostgreSQL for each job.
endif::[]
* High volume of hosts.
ifdef::katello,orcharhino,satellite[]
* High volume of synchronized content.

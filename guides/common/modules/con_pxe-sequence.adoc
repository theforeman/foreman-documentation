. The host boots the PXE image if no other bootable image is found.
. A NIC of the host sends a broadcast request to the DHCP server.
. The DHCP server receives the request and sends standard information about the network: IP address, subnet mask, gateway, DNS, the location of a TFTP server, and a boot image.
. The host obtains the boot loader `image/pxelinux.0` and the configuration file `pxelinux.cfg/00:MA:CA:AD:D` from the TFTP server.
. The host configuration specifies the location of a kernel image, `initrd` and Kickstart.
. The host downloads the files and installs the image.

= Description of LDAP Settings

The following table provides a description for each setting in the *Account* tab.

.Account Tab Settings
[cols="2,7" options="header"]
|====
| Setting | Description
|*Account* a| The user name of the LDAP account that has read access to the LDAP server.
User name is not required if the server allows anonymous reading, otherwise use the full path to the user's object.
For example:
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
uid=$login,cn=users,cn=accounts,dc=example,dc=com
----
The `$login` variable stores the username entered on the login page as a literal string.
The value is accessed when the variable is expanded.

The variable cannot be used with external user groups from an LDAP source because {Project} needs to retrieve the group list without the user logging in.
Use either an anonymous, or dedicated service user.
|*Account password* a|The LDAP password for the user defined in the *Account username* field.
This field can remain blank if the *Account username* is using the `$login` variable.
|*Base DN* a|The top level domain name of the LDAP directory.
|*Groups base DN* a|The top level domain name of the LDAP directory tree that contains groups.
|*LDAP filter* a|A filter to restrict LDAP queries.
|*Automatically Create Accounts In {Project}* a|If this checkbox is selected, {Project} creates user accounts for LDAP users when they log in to {Project} for the first time.
After they log in for the first time, the {Project} administrator has to assign roles to them manually.
See link:{AdministeringDocURL}Assigning_Roles_to_a_User_{project-context}[Assigning Roles to a User] to assign user accounts appropriate roles in {Project}.
|*Usergroup Sync* a|If this option is selected, the user group membership of a user is automatically synchronized when the user logs in, which ensures the membership is always up to date.
If this option is cleared, {Project} relies on a cron job to regularly synchronize group membership (every 30 minutes by default).

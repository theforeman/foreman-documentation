= Assigning the correct organization and location to {SmartProxyServer} in the {ProjectWebUI}

After installing {SmartProxyServer} packages, if there is more than one organization or location, you must assign the correct organization and location to {SmartProxy} to make {SmartProxy} visible in the {ProjectWebUI}.

[NOTE]
====
Assigning a {SmartProxy} to the same location as your {ProjectServer} with an embedded {SmartProxy} prevents {Insights} from uploading the {Insights} inventory.
To enable the inventory upload, synchronize SSH keys for both {SmartProxies}.

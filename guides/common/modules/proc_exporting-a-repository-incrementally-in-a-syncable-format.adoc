= Exporting a Repository Incrementally in a Syncable Format

Exporting a repository can be a very expensive operation in terms of system resources.
A typical {RHEL} tree may occupy several gigabytes of space on {ProjectServer}.

In such cases, you can use *Incremental Export* to export only pieces of content that changed since the previous export.
Incremental exports typically result in smaller archive files than the full exports.

The example below shows incremental export of a repository in the Library lifecycle environment.

.Procedure
. Create an incremental export:

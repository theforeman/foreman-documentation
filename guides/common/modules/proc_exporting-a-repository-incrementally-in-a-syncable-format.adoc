= Exporting a Repository Incrementally in a Syncable Format

Exporting a repository can be a very costly operation in terms of system resources.
A typical {RHEL} tree may occupy several gigabytes of space on {ProjectServer}.

In such cases, you can use *Incremental Export* to export only pieces of content that changed since the previous export.
Incremental exports typically result in smaller archive files than full exports.

The procedure below shows an incremental export of a repository in the Library lifecycle environment.

.Procedure
. Create an incremental export:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer content-export incremental repository \
 --organization="_My_Organization_" \
 --product="_My_Product_" \
 --name="_My_Repository_" \
 --format=syncable
----
. Optional: View the exported data:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# find /var/lib/pulp/exports/Default_Organization/Export-SYNCABLE-Red_Hat_Ansible_Engine_2_for_RHEL_8_x86_64_RPMs-1/2.0/2023-03-09T10-55-48-05-00/ -name "*.rpm"

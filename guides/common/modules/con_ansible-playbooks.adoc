= Ansible Playbooks

Ansible playbooks provide the configuration of deployed applications.
They are required along with to an xref:Application_Definitions_{context}[] to create xref:Application_Instances_{context}[].

Ansible group variables are mandatory and support any valid YAML data.

Ansible playbooks need to contain Ansible group variables for each provided service.

The Ansible inventory is automatically created by the ACD plugin.

In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Applications > Ansible Playbooks* to manage Ansible playbooks for application centric deployment.

[CAUTION]
====
The Ansible playbook must contain all necessary roles and tasks to execute the playbook.

If your Ansible playbooks are currently using Ansible collections, ensure that these Ansible collections are added manually to every {SmartProxyServer}.
To install Ansible collections manually, enter the following command on your {ProjectServer} and {SmartProxyServer}:

[options="nowrap", subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
# ansible-galaxy collection install _namespace.collection_
----

Replace `namespace.collection` with the Ansible collection you are intending to use, for example `community.general`.
This uses the Ansible galaxy as configured in the `ansible.cfg` file.

To get a list of the top table sizes in disk space for both Candlepin, Foreman, and Pulp check https://github.com/RedHatSatellite/satellite-support/blob/master/postgres-size-report[postgres-size-report] script in https://github.com/RedHatSatellite/satellite-support[satellite-support] git repository.

PGbench utility (note you may need to resize PostgreSQL data directory `{postgresql-lib-dir}` directory to 100 GiB or what does benchmark take to run) might be used to measure PostgreSQL performance on your system.
Use `{package-install} postgresql-contrib` to install it.

// can we be more specific here? why would/could it matter?
Choice of filesystem for PostgreSQL data directory might matter as well.

[WARNING]
====
* Never do any testing on production system and without valid backup.
* Before you start testing, see how big the database files are.
Testing with a really small database would not produce any meaningful results.
For example, if the DB is only 20 GiB and the buffer pool is 32 GiB, it won't show problems with large number of connections because the data will be completely buffered.

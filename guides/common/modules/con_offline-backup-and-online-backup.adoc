= Offline backup and online backup

[role="_abstract"]
To back up your {ProjectServer}, you can use an offline backup or an online backup.

There are two main methods of backing up {ProjectServer}:

* Offline backup
+
All {Project} services are shut down during an offline backup.

* Online backup
+
Only {Project} services that affect the consistency of the backup, including all background workers, are shut down while the backup process is running.
Online backups check for consistency and require more time than offline backups. 

For more information about each of these methods, you can view the usage statements for each backup method.

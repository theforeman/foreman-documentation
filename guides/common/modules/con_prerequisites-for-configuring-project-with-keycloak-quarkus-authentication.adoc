= Prerequisites for configuring {Project} with {keycloak-quarkus} authentication

[role="_abstract"]
On your {ProjectServer}:

* Install the packages required for registering a {keycloak} client:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
# {project-package-install} mod_auth_openidc keycloak-httpd-client-install python3-lxml
----
// python3-lxml is only needed on EL9 because of https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-31496
* Check which `keycloak-httpd-client-install` version is installed:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
# rpm --query keycloak-httpd-client-install
----

On the {keycloak} side, ensure you meet the following requirements:

* If `keycloak-httpd-client-install` version 1.2 or earlier is installed on your {ProjectServer}, make sure to use the appropriate context path:
** You can use a {keycloak} server that has been initialized with the `--http-relative-path=/auth` context path.
To access a {keycloak} server initialized with `--http-relative-path=/auth` from its web UI, go to `https://_{keycloak-example-com}_:8443/auth`.
** If you want to use a different context path, make manual adjustments after the initialization with `/auth` or configure the `_foreman-openidc_oidc_keycloak_Foreman_Realm_.conf` file of the HTTPd service manually.

For more information about configuring a different context path, see the https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_build_of_keycloak/24.0/html-single/server_guide/index#reverseproxy-different-context-path-on-reverse-proxy[_{RHBK} Administration Guide_].
endif::[]
* If `keycloak-httpd-client-install` version 1.3 or later is installed, your {keycloak} server does not need to be initialized with the `--http-relative-path=/auth` context path.
* Your {keycloak} server uses HTTPS instead of HTTP.
* If the certificates or the CA are self-signed, they have been added to the end-user certificate truststore.
* Your {keycloak} account has administrative privileges.
* A realm is created on the {keycloak} server for {Project} user accounts, for example `_{Project}_Realm_`.
* User accounts have been imported or added to {keycloak}.

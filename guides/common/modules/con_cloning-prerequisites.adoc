= Prerequisites

To clone {ProjectServer}, ensure that you have the following resources available:

* A minimal install of {EL} 9 to become the target server.
Do not install {EL} 9 software groups or third-party applications.
Ensure that your server complies with all the required specifications.
For more information, see {InstallingServerDocURL}Preparing_your_Environment_for_Installation_{project-context}[Preparing your Environment for Installation] in _{InstallingServerDocTitle}_.
* A backup of your {ProjectServer} that you make using the `{foreman-maintain} backup` script.
You can use a backup with or without Pulp data.
* A {Project} subscription for the target server.

Before you begin cloning, ensure the following conditions exist:

* The target server is on an isolated network.
This avoids unwanted communication with {SmartProxyServers} and hosts.
* The target server has at least the same storage capacity as the source server.

.Customized configuration files

If you have any customized configurations on your source server that are not managed by the `{foreman-installer}` tool or {Project} backup process, you must manually back up these files.

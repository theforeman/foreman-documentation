{OpenStack} provides the foundation to build a private or public Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud.
It offers a massively scalable, fault-tolerant platform for the development of cloud-enabled workloads.
In {ProjectNameX}, you can interact with {OpenStack} REST API to create cloud instances and control their power management states.

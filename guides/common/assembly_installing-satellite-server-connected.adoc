= Installing {ProjectServer}

ifeval::["{build}" == "satellite"]
When you install {ProjectServer} from a connected network, you can obtain packages and receive updates directly from the Red Hat Content Delivery Network.

NOTE: You cannot register {ProjectServer} to itself.

Use the following procedures to install {ProjectServer}, perform the initial configuration, and import subscription manifests.
For more information on subscription manifests, see {ContentManagementDocURL}Managing_Subscriptions[Managing Subscriptions] in the _Content Management Guide_.
endif::[]

ifeval::["{build}" != "satellite"]
Use the following procedures to install {ProjectServer} and perform the initial configuration.
endif::[]

ifeval::["{build}" == "foreman-el"]
On CentOS, you can install {Project} with or without the Katello plug-in.
If you are a new user, consider installing {Project} with the Katello plug-in.
endif::[]

ifeval::["{build}" == "foreman-deb"]
On Debian or Ubuntu operating systems, installations with the Katello plug-in are not supported.
Ignore any references to the Katello plug-in.
endif::[]

Note that the {ProjectX} installation script is based on Puppet, which means that if you run the installation script more than once, it might overwrite any manual configuration changes.
⁠
To avoid this and determine which future changes apply, use the `--noop` argument when you run the installation script.
This argument ensures that no actual changes are made.
Potential changes are written to `/var/log/foreman-installer/{project-context}.log`.

Files are always backed up and so you can revert any unwanted changes.
For example, in the foreman-installer logs, you can see an entry similar to the following about Filebucket:

[options="wrap"]
----
/Stage[main]/Dhcp/File[/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf]: Filebucketed /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf to puppet with sum 622d9820b8e764ab124367c68f5fa3a1
----

You can restore the previous file as follows:

[options="wrap"]
----
# puppet filebucket -l \
restore /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf 622d9820b8e764ab124367c68f5fa3a1

== Configuring {ProjectServer}

Install {ProjectServer} using the `{foreman-installer}` installation script.
Choose from one of the following methods:

* xref:configuring-satellite-manually_{context}[].
This method is performed by running the installation script with one or more command options.
The command options override the corresponding default initial configuration options and are recorded in the {Project} answer file.
You can run the script as often as needed to configure any necessary options.

* xref:configuring-satellite-automatically-using-an-answer-file_{context}[].
This method is performed by using an answer file to automate the configuration process when running the installation script.
The default {Project} answer file is `/etc/foreman-installer/scenarios.d/{project-context}-answers.yaml`.
The answer file in use is set by the `answer_file` directive in the `/etc/foreman-installer/scenarios.d/{project-context}.yaml` configuration file.

NOTE: Depending on the options that you use when running the {Project} installer, the configuration can take several minutes to complete.
An administrator can view the answer file to see previously used options for both methods.

= Integrating {ProjectName} and {awx}

You can integrate {ProjectName} and {awx} to use {ProjectServer} as a dynamic inventory source for {awx}.

You can also use the provisioning callback function to run playbooks on hosts managed by {Project}, from either the host or {awx}. When provisioning new hosts from {ProjectServer}, you can use the provisioning callback function to trigger playbook runs from {awx}. The playbook configures the host following Kickstart deployment.

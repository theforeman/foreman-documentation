// User stories are based on the following template:
// As a <user>, I want to leverage <feature X> to reach <state Y> so that I solve <problem Z>.
// Persona of Foreman administrator are based on the "admin" persona as specified in https://github.com/theforeman/foreman-documentation/pull/4319/files 

As an administrator, I want to leverage {Insights} to diagnose my {Project} hosts; I can register my {Project} Server with {Insights} directly so that it sends data to Red Hat services.

As an administrator, I want to leverage {Insights} to diagnose my {Project} hosts; I want to avoid sending system data to Red Hat services.

As an administrator, I want to configure my {ProjectServer} for pull-based remote execution to be able to manage my hosts remotely without enabling outgoing connections from the server to the hosts.

As an administrator, I want to configure my {ProjectServer} to provision hosts in an IPv6 network with UEFI HTTP Boot provisioning.

As an administrator, I want to configure my {ProjectServer} with an HTTP proxy that will handle requests to the content source, such as Red Hat CDN, so that the server can remain behind a firewall.

As an administrator, I want to enable the baseboard management controller (BMC) module on my {ProjectServer} so that I can perform power management tasks on hosts using the intelligent platform management interface (IPMI) or a similar protocol.

As an administrator, I want to configure the server for outgoing emails so that the server can send email notifications to users.

As an administrator, I want to integrate my {ProjectServer} with an {FreeIPA} realm so that {Project} can automatically manage the lifecycle of the systems enrolled in the {FreeIPA} domain.

As an administrator, I want to configure an alternate CNAME for {Project} so that I can deploy the {Project} web interface on a different domain name than the one that is used by hosts to connect to {Project}.

As an administrator, I want to configure my {ProjectServer} with a custom SSL certificate to ensure encrypted communications between the server and all hosts in a deployment where I cannot or do not want to use {Project}'s default self-signed certificate. (Includes substory: I want to be able to switch back to using {Project}'s default self-signed certificate.)

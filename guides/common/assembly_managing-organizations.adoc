= Managing Organizations

Organizations divide {ProjectNameX} resources into logical groups based on ownership, purpose, content, security level, or other divisions.
You can create and manage multiple organizations through {ProjectNameX}, then divide and assign your Red Hat subscriptions to each individual organization.
This provides a method of managing the content of several individual organizations under one management system.
Here are some examples of organization management:

Single Organization::
  A small business with a simple system administration chain.
In this case, you can create a single organization for the business and assign content to it.

Multiple Organizations::
  A large company that owns several smaller business units.
For example, a company with separate system administration and software development groups.
In this case, you can create organizations for the company and each of the business units it owns.
This keeps the system infrastructure for each separate.
You can then assign content to each organization based on its needs.

External Organizations::
  A company that manages external systems for other organizations.
For example, a company offering cloud computing and web hosting resources to customers.
In this case, you can create an organization for the company's own system infrastructure and then an organization for each external business.
You can then assign content to each organization where necessary.

A default installation of {ProjectNameX} has a default organization called *Default_Organization*.

.New Users
If a new user is not assigned a default organization, their access is limited.
To grant systems rights to users, assign them to a default organization.
The next time the user logs on to {Project}, the user's account has the correct system rights.

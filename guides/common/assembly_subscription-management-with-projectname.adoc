== Simple Content Access (SCA) in {ProjectName}

Simple Content Access (SCA) in {Project} simplifies management of software entitlements. With SCA, you do not need to attach subscriptions individually to managed hosts. Instead, SCA enables you to add new valid subscriptions to a subscription allocation or manifest and refresh within Satellite.

NOTE: Simple Content Access (SCA) was introduced to replace entitlement-based subscription management. New organizations default to having SCA enabled. Entitlement-based subscription management is deprecated. See 
{ReleaseNotesDocURL}[_{ReleaseNotesDocTitle}_] for details.

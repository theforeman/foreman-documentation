= Configure an Alternate CNAME for {Project}
You can configure an alternate CNAME for {Project}. This might be useful if you want to deploy the {Project} web interface on a different domain name than the one that is used by client systems to connect to {Project}. You must plan the alternate CNAME configuration in advance prior to installing {SmartProxies} and registering hosts to {Project} to avoid redeploying new certificates to hosts.

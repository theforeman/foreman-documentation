= Preparing your environment for {Project} installation in an IPv6 network

You can install and use {Project} in an IPv6 network.
Before installing {Project} in an IPv6 network, view the limitations and ensure that you meet the requirements.

To provision hosts in an IPv6 network, after installing {Project}, you must also configure {Project} for the UEFI HTTP boot provisioning.
For more information, see xref:configuring-for-uefi-http-boot-provisioning-in-an-ipv6-network_{context}[].

[NOTE]
====
{Project} does not support configuring an HTTP proxy using a direct IPv6 address.
Instead, configure the HTTP proxy with a FQDN that resolves to the IPv6 address. 
Using an IPv6 address as the HTTP proxy URL causes it to fail.

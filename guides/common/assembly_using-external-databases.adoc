= Using External Databases with {Project}

ifeval::["{build}" == "foreman-el"]
For Red Hat systems only.
endif::[]

As part of the installation process for {ProjectName}, the *{foreman-installer}* command installs a PostgreSQL database on the same server as {Project}.
In certain {Project} deployments, using external databases instead of the default local databases can help with the server load.

ifeval::["{build}" == "satellite"]
Red Hat does not provide support or tools for external database maintenance.
This includes backups, upgrades, and database tuning.
You must have your own database administrator to support and maintain external databases.
endif::[]

To create and use external databases for {Project}, you must complete the following procedures:

. xref:preparing-a-host-for-external-databases_{context}[].
Prepare a {RHEL} 7 server to host the external databases.
. xref:installing-postgresql_{context}[].
Prepare PostgreSQL with databases for {Project} and Candlepin and dedicated users owning them.
. xref:configuring-satellite-to-use-external-databases_{context}[].
Edit the parameters of `{foreman-installer}` to point to the new databases, and run `{foreman-installer}`.

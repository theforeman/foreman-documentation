= Using External Databases with {Project}

ifeval::["{build}" == "foreman"]
For Red Hat systems only.
endif::[]

As part of the installation process for {ProjectName}, the *{foreman-installer}* command installs MongoDB and PostgreSQL databases on the same server as {Project}. In certain {Project} deployments, using external databases instead of the default local databases can help with the server load. Depending on your requirements, you can use external databases for either MongoDB or PostgreSQL database, or both.

ifeval::["{build}" == "satellite"]
Red Hat does not provide support or tools for external database maintenance. This includes backups, upgrades, and database tuning. You must have your own database administrator to support and maintain external databases.

// Known issue: need to explicitly include the section titles so that two xrefs in the same paragraph render correctly
Use xref:mongodb-as-an-external-database-considerations_{context}[MongoDB as an External Database Considerations] and xref:postgresql-as-an-external-database-considerations_{context}[PostgreSQL as an External Database Considerations] to decide if you want to use external databases for your {Project} deployment.

To create and use external databases for {Project}, you must complete the following procedures:

. xref:preparing-a-host-for-external-databases_{context}[]. Prepare a {RHEL} 7 server to host the external databases.
. xref:installing-mongodb_{context}[]. Prepare MongoDB with user `pulp` owning the `pulp_database`
. xref:installing-postgresql_{context}[]. Prepare PostgreSQL with databases for {Project} and Candlepin and dedicated users owning them.
. xref:configuring-satellite-to-use-external-databases_{context}[]. Edit the parameters of `{foreman-installer}` to point to the new databases, and run `{foreman-installer}`.

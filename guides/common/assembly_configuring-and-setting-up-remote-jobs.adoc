= Configuring and Setting up Remote Jobs

Use this section as a guide to configuring {Project} to execute jobs on remote hosts.

Any command that you want to apply to a remote host must be defined as a job template.
After you have defined a job template you can execute it multiple times.

== Distributing SSH Keys for Remote Execution

To use SSH keys for authenticating remote execution connections, you must distribute the public SSH key from {SmartProxy} to its attached hosts that you want to manage.
Ensure that the SSH service is enabled and running on the hosts.
Configure any network or host-based firewalls to enable access to port 22.

Use one of the following methods to distribute the public SSH key from {SmartProxy} to target hosts:

. xref:distributing-ssh-keys-for-remote-execution-manually_{context}[].
. xref:using-the-api-to-obtain-ssh-keys-for-remote-execution_{context}[].
. xref:configuring-a-kickstart-template-to-distribute-ssh-keys-during-provisioning_{context}[].
. For new {Project} hosts, you can deploy SSH keys to {Project} hosts during registration using the global registration template.
For more information, see {ManagingHostsDocURL}registering-a-host_managing-hosts[Registering a Host to {ProjectName} Using the Global Registration Template].

{Project} distributes SSH keys for the remote execution feature to the hosts provisioned from {Project} by default.

If the hosts are running on Amazon Web Services, enable password authentication.

= Installing {ProjectServer}

When the intended host for {ProjectServer} is in a disconnected environment, you can install {ProjectServer} by using an external computer to download an ISO image of the packages, and copying the packages to the system you want to install {ProjectServer} on.
This method is not recommended for any other situation as ISO images might not contain the latest updates, bug fixes, and functionality.

Use the following procedures to install {ProjectServer}, perform the initial configuration, and import subscription manifests.

ifndef::foreman-deb[]
Before you continue, consider which manifests are relevant for your environment.
For more information on manifests, see {ContentManagementDocURL}Managing_Red_Hat_Subscriptions_content-management[Managing Red Hat Subscriptions] in _{ContentManagementDocTitle}_.
endif::[]

[NOTE]
====
You cannot register {ProjectServer} to itself.

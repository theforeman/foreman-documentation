= SSL authentication overview

{ProjectName} uses HTTPS, which provides a degree of encryption and identity verification when communicating with {ProjectServer}.
{Project} {ProjectVersion} does not support non-SSL communications.

By default, {ProjectServer} uses a self-signed certificate.
This certificate acts as both the server certificate to verify the encryption key and the certificate authority (CA) to trust the identity of {ProjectServer}.

You can configure {ProjectServer} to use a custom SSL certificate.

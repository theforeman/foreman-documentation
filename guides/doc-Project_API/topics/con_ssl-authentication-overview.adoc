= SSL authentication overview

{ProjectName} uses HTTPS, which provides a degree of encryption and identity verification when communicating with a {ProjectServer}.
{Project} {ProjectVersion} does not support non-SSL communications.

Each {ProjectServer} uses a self-signed certificate.
This certificate acts as both the server certificate to verify the encryption key and the certificate authority (CA) to trust the identity of {ProjectServer}.

.Enabling OAuth mapping

By default, {Project} authorizes all OAuth API requests as the built-in anonymous API administrator account.
Therefore, API responses include all {Project} data.
However, you can also specify the {Project} user that makes the request and restrict access to data to that user.

To enable OAuth user mapping, enter the following command:

[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-installer} --foreman-oauth-map-users true
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
{Project} does not sign the header in an OAuth request.
Anyone with a valid consumer key can impersonate any {Project} user.

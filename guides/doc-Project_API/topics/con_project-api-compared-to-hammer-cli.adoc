= {Project} API compared to Hammer CLI

For many tasks, you can use both Hammer and {Project} API.
You can use Hammer as a human-friendly interface to {Project} API.
For example, to test responses to API calls before applying them in a script, use the `--debug` option to inspect API calls that Hammer issues: `hammer --debug organization list`.

In the background, each Hammer command first establishes a binding to the API and then sends a request.
This can have performance implications when executing a large number of Hammer commands in sequence.
In contrast, scripts that use API commands communicate directly with the {Project} API.

Note that you must manually update scripts that use API commands, while Hammer automatically reflects changes in the API.

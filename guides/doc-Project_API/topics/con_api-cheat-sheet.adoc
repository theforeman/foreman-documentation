You can review the following examples of how to use the {ProjectName} API to perform various tasks.
You can use the API on {ProjectServer} via HTTPS on port 443 or on {SmartProxyServer} via HTTPS on port 8443.

[IMPORTANT]
====
ifdef::foreman,katello[]
Calling the API through {SmartProxyServer} has been deprecated since {Project} 3.12.
endif::[]
ifdef::satellite[]
Calling the API through {SmartProxyServer} has been deprecated since {Project} 6.16.
endif::[]
ifdef::orcharhino[]
Calling the API through {SmartProxyServer} has been deprecated since {Project} XXX.
endif::[]
Migrate your integrations to call the API through {ProjectServer}.

You can address these different port requirements within the script itself.
For example, in Ruby, you can specify the {ProjectServer} and {SmartProxyServer} URLs as follows:

[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
url = 'https://_{foreman-example-com}_/api/v2/'
{smart-proxy-context}_url = 'https://_{smartproxy-example-com}_:8443/api/v2/'
ifdef::katello,orcharhino,satellite[]
katello_url = 'https://_{foreman-example-com}_/katello/api/v2/'
endif::[]
----

For the host that is registered to {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer}, you can determine the correct port required to access the API from the `/etc/rhsm/rhsm.conf` file, in the port entry of the `[server]` section.
You can use these values to fully automate your scripts, removing any need to verify which ports to use.

The following examples use `curl` for sending API requests.

== Introduction

{ProjectName} provides a Representational State Transfer (REST) API. The API provides software developers and system administrators with control over their {ProjectName} environment outside of the standard web interface. The REST API is useful for developers and administrators who aim to integrate the functionality of {ProjectName} with custom scripts or external applications that access the API over HTTP.

=== Overview of the {Project} API

The benefits of using the REST API are:

* Broad client support {endash} any programming language, framework, or system with support for HTTP protocol can use the API.
* Self-descriptive {endash} client applications require minimal knowledge of the {ProjectName} infrastructure because a user discovers many details at runtime.
* Resource-based model {endash} the resource-based REST model provides a natural way to manage a virtualization platform.

You can use the REST API to perform the following tasks:

* Integrate with enterprise IT systems.
* Integrate with third-party applications.
* Perform automated maintenance or error checking tasks.
* Automate repetitive tasks with scripts.

As you prepare to upgrade {ProjectServer}, ensure that any scripts you use that contain {Project} API commands are up to date. API commands differ between versions of {Project}.

//For more information about changes in the API, see the Knowledgebase article https://access.redhat.com/articles/4396911[API Changes Between {Project} Versions] on the Red{nbsp}Hat Customer Portal.//

=== {Project} API compared to Hammer CLI tool

For many tasks, you can use both Hammer and {Project} API. You can use Hammer as a human-friendly interface to {Project} API. For example, to test responses to API calls before applying them in a script, use the `--debug` option to inspect API calls that Hammer issues: `hammer --debug organization list`.

In the background, each Hammer command first establishes a binding to the API and then sends a request. This can have performance implications when executing a large number of Hammer commands in sequence. In contrast, scripts that use API commands communicate directly with the {Project} API.

Note that you must manually update scripts that use API commands, while Hammer automatically reflects changes in the API. For more information, see the link:{HammerDocURL}[_{HammerDocTitle}_].

= Deployment Scenarios

There are three deployment scenarios for {ProjectName} in Amazon Web Services:

. One region setup
. Connecting on-premise and AWS region
. Connecting different regions

.Scenario 1: One region setup

The least complex configuration of {ProjectServer} in Amazon Web Services consists of both the {ProjectServer} and the content hosts residing within the same region and within the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).

You can also use a different availability zone.

.Scenario 2: Connecting on-premise and AWS region

Create a VPN connection between the on-premise location and the AWS region where the {SmartProxy} resides.

It is also possible to use the external host name of {ProjectServer} when you register the instance which runs {SmartProxyServer}.

*Option 1: Site-to-Site VPN connection between the AWS region and the On-Premise Datacenter*

*Option 2: Direct connection using the External DNS host name*

.Scenario 3: Connecting different regions

Create a site-to-site VPN connection between the different regions so that you can use the Internal DNS host name when you register the instance that runs {SmartProxyServer} to the {ProjectServer}.

If you do not establish a site-to-site VPN connection, use the external DNS host name when you register the instance that runs {SmartProxyServer} to the {ProjectServer}.

[NOTE]
Most Public Cloud Providers do not charge for data being transferred into a region, or between availability zones within a single region; however, they do charge for data leaving the region to the Internet.

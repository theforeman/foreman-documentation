= Removing the Previous Version of the {Project} Tools Repository

After completing the upgrade to {Project} {ProjectVersion}, the {ProjectName} Tools {ProjectVersionPrevious} repository can be removed from Content Views and then disabled.

Disable Version {ProjectVersionPrevious} of the {Project} Tools Repository:

. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Content* > *Red Hat Repositories*.
. In the *Enabled Repositories* area, locate *{ProjectName} Tools {ProjectVersionPrevious} for RHEL 7 Server RPMs x86_64*.
. Click the *Disable* icon to the right.

If the repository is still contained in a Content View then you cannot disable it.
Packages from a disabled repository are removed automatically by a scheduled task.

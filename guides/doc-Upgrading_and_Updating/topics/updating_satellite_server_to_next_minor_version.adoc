= Updating {ProjectServer}

.Prerequisites

* Ensure that you have synchronized {ProjectServer} repositories for {Project}, {SmartProxy}, and {project-client-name}.
* Ensure each external {SmartProxy} and Content Host can be updated by promoting the updated repositories to all relevant Content Views.

[WARNING]
If you customize configuration files, manually or use a tool such as Hiera, these customizations are overwritten when the installation script runs during upgrading or updating.
You can use the `--noop` option with the {foreman-installer} script to test for changes.
For more information, see the Red Hat Knowledgebase solution https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3351311[How to use the noop option to check for changes in {Project} config files during an upgrade].

*Updating {ProjectServer} to the Next Minor Version*

.To Update {ProjectServer}:

. Ensure the {Project} Maintenance repository is enabled:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="attributes"]
----
# subscription-manager repos --enable \
{RepoRHEL7ServerSatelliteMaintenanceProductVersion}
----

. Check the available versions to confirm the next minor version is listed:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} upgrade list-versions
----

. Use the health check option to determine if the system is ready for upgrade.
On first use of this command, `{foreman-maintain}` prompts you to enter the hammer admin user credentials and saves them in the `/etc/foreman-maintain/foreman-maintain-hammer.yml` file.
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} upgrade check --target-version {TargetVersion}.__z__
----
+
Review the results and address any highlighted error conditions before performing the upgrade.

. Because of the lengthy update time, use a utility such as `screen` to suspend and reattach a communication session.
You can then check the upgrade progress without staying connected to the command shell continuously.
For more information about using the screen command, see link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/5247[How do I use the screen command?] article in the _Red{nbsp}Hat Knowledge{nbsp}Base_.
+
If you lose connection to the command shell where the upgrade command is running, you can see the logged messages in the `{installer-log-file}` file to check if the process completed successfully.

. Perform the upgrade:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} upgrade run --target-version {TargetVersion}.__z__
----

. Check when the kernel packages were last updated:
+
[options="nowrap"]
----
# rpm -qa --last | grep kernel
----

. Optional: If a kernel update occurred since the last reboot, stop the `{foreman-maintain}` services and reboot the system:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} service stop
# reboot
----

= Updating Disconnected {ProjectServer}

.Prerequisites

* Before syncing the following repositories, set the download policy to *Immediate*.
This is required because {Project} downloads all packages only during synchronization of repositories with the immediate download policy.
+
* Ensure that you have synchronized the following {ProjectServer} repositories for {Project}, {SmartProxy}, and {project-client-name}:
** rhel-7-server-rpms
** rhel-7-server-satellite-6.8-rpms
** rhel-7-server-satellite-maintenance-6-rpms
** rhel-server-rhscl-7-rpms
** rhel-7-server-ansible-2.9-rpms
+
For more information about configuring download policies, see {ContentManagementDocURL}changing_the_download_policy_for_a_repository[Changing a download policy for a repository] in the _Content Management guide_.
+
* Ensure no Red Hat repositories are enabled by entering the command:
+
----
# yum repolist
----

.Updating Disconnected {ProjectServer} to the Next Minor Version

. Create a new configuration file as follows:

= Updating {SmartProxyServer}

Use this procedure to update {SmartProxyServer}s to the next minor version.

.Procedure

. Ensure that the {Project} Maintenance repository is enabled:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="attributes"]
----
# subscription-manager repos --enable \
{RepoRHEL7ServerSatelliteMaintenanceProductVersion}
----

. Check the available versions to confirm the next minor version is listed:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} upgrade list-versions
----

. Use the health check option to determine if the system is ready for upgrade:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} upgrade check --target-version {TargetVersion}.__z__
----
+
Review the results and address any highlighted error conditions before performing the upgrade.

. Because of the lengthy update time, use a utility such as `tmux` to suspend and reattach a communication session.
You can then check the upgrade progress without staying connected to the command shell continuously.
+
If you lose connection to the command shell where the upgrade command is running, you can see the logged messages in the `{installer-smartproxy-log-file}` file to check if the process completed successfully.

. Perform the upgrade:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} upgrade run --target-version {TargetVersion}.__z__
----

. Check when the kernel packages were last updated:
+
[options="nowrap"]
----
# rpm -qa --last | grep kernel
----

. Optional: If a kernel update occurred since the last reboot, stop {Project} services and reboot the system:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} service stop
# reboot
----

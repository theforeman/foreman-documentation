.Upgrade Scenarios

- To upgrade a {ProjectServer} connected to the Red{nbsp}Hat Content Delivery Network, proceed to xref:upgrading_a_connected_satellite_server[].

- To upgrade a {ProjectServer} not connected to the Red{nbsp}Hat Content Delivery Network, proceed to xref:upgrading_a_disconnected_satellite[].

You cannot upgrade a self-registered {Project}. You must migrate a self-registered {Project} to the Red Hat Content Delivery Network (CDN) and then perform the upgrade. To migrate a self-registered {Project} to the CDN, see {BaseURL}upgrading_and_updating_red_hat_satellite/upgrading_red_hat_satellite#migrating_a_self_registered_satellite[Migrating Self-Registered {Project}s] in the _{ProjectXY} Upgrading and Updating {ProjectName}_ guide.

.FIPS mode
You cannot upgrade {ProjectServer} from a RHEL base system that is not operating in FIPS mode to a RHEL base system that is operating in FIPS mode.

To run {ProjectServer} on a RHEL base system operating in FIPS mode, you must install {Project} on a freshly provisioned RHEL base system operating in FIPS mode. For more information, see {BaseURL}installing_satellite_server_from_a_connected_network/preparing-environment-for-satellite-installation#system-requirements_satellite[System Requirements] in _Installing {ProjectServer} from a Connected Network_.

For interactive upgrade instructions, you can also use the {ProjectName} Upgrade Helper on the Red{nbsp}Hat Customer Portal.
This application provides you with an exact guide to match your current version number.
You can find instructions that are specific to your upgrade path, as well as steps to prevent known issues.

[[upgrading_prerequisites]]
== Prerequisites

Upgrading to {Project} {ProjectVersion} affects your entire {Project} infrastructure.
Before proceeding, complete the following:

* Read the {ProjectName} {ProjectVersion} {ReleaseNotesURL}[Release Notes].
* Plan your upgrade path.
For more information, see xref:upgrade_paths[].
* Plan for the required downtime. {Project} services are shut down during the upgrade.
The upgrade process duration might vary depending on your hardware configuration, network speed, and the amount of data that is stored on the server.
+
Upgrading {Project} takes approximately 1{range}2 hours.
+
Upgrading {SmartProxy} takes approximately 10{range}30 minutes.

* Ensure that you have sufficient storage space on your server.
For more information, see {InstallingServerDocURL}Preparing_your_Environment_for_Installation_{project-context}[Preparing your Environment for Installation] in _{InstallingServerDocTitle}_ and {InstallingSmartProxyDocURL}preparing-environment-for-capsule-installation[Preparing your Environment for Installation] in _Installing {SmartProxyServer}_.
* Back up your {ProjectServer} and all {SmartProxyServers}.
For more information, see {AdministeringDocURL}backing-up-{project-context}-server-and-{smart-proxy-context}_admin[Backing Up {ProjectServer} and {SmartProxyServer}] in _{AdministeringDocTitle}_.
* Plan for updating any scripts you use that contain {Project} API commands because some API commands differ between versions of {Project}.

ifdef::satellite[]
Ensure that all {ProjectServer}s are on the same version.

[[following_the_progress_of_the_upgrade]]
== Following the Progress of the Upgrade

Because of the lengthy upgrade time, use a utility such as `tmux` to suspend and reattach a communication session.
You can then check the upgrade progress without staying connected to the command shell continuously.
For more information, see the `tmux` manual page.

If you lose connection to the command shell where the upgrade command is running you can see the logs in `{installer-log-file}` to check if the process completed successfully.

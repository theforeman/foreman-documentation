[[post-upgrade_tasks]]

Some of the procedures in this section are optional. You can choose to perform only those procedures that are relevant to your installation.

If you use the PXE-based discovery process, then you must complete the discovery upgrade procedure on {Project} and on any {SmartProxyServer} with hosts that you want to be listed in {Project} on the *Hosts* > *Discovered hosts* page.

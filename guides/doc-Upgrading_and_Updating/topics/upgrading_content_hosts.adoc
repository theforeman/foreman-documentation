= Upgrading Content Hosts

The {project-client-name} repository provides `katello-agent` and `katello-host-tools`, which provide communication services for managing Errata.

NOTE: The Katello agent is deprecated and will be removed in a future {Project} version.
Migrate your workloads to use the remote execution feature to update clients remotely.
For more information, see {ManagingHostsDocURL}Migrating_From_Katello_Agent_to_Remote_Execution_managing-hosts[Migrating from Katello Agent to Remote Execution] in the _Managing Hosts Guide_.

For deployments using `katello-agent` and *goferd*, update all clients to the new version of `katello-agent`.
For deployments not using `katello-agent` and *goferd*, update all clients to the new version of `katello-host-tools`.
Complete this action as soon as possible so that your clients are fully compatible with {ProjectServer}.

.Prerequisites
* You must have upgraded {ProjectServer}.
* You must have enabled the new {project-client-name} repositories on the {Project}.
* You must have synchronized the new repositories in the {Project}.
* If you have not previously installed `katello-agent` on your clients and you want to install it, use the manual method.
For more information, see xref:cli-upgrading_content_hosts[].

[WARNING]
====
If you implemented custom certificates, you must retain the content of both the `/root/ssl-build` directory and the directory in which you created any source files associated with your custom certificates.

Failure to retain these files during an upgrade causes the upgrade to fail.
If these files have been deleted, they must be restored from a backup in order for the upgrade to proceed.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Hosts* > *Content Hosts* and select the Content Hosts that you want to upgrade.
. From the *Select Action* list, select *Manage Repository Sets*.
. From the *Repository Sets Management* list, select the *{ProjectName} Tools {ProjectVersionPrevious}* checkbox.
. From the *Select Action* list, select *Override to Disabled*, and click *Done*.
. When the process completes, on the same set of hosts from the previous steps, from the *Select Action* list, select *Manage Repository Sets*.
. From the *Repository Sets Management* list, select the *Red Hat {project-client-name}* checkbox.
. From the *Select Action* list, select *Override to Enabled*, and click *Done*.
. When the process completes, on the same set of hosts from the previous steps, from the *Select Action* list, select *Manage Packages*.
. In the *Package* search field, enter one of the following options depending on your configuration:
+
* If your deployment uses `katello-agent` and *goferd*, enter `katello-agent`.
* If your deployment does not use `katello-agent` and *goferd*, enter `katello-host-tools`.
+
. Until https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1649764[BZ#1649764] is resolved, from the *Update* list, you must select *via remote execution*.
This is required because if you update the package using the Katello agent, the package update disrupts the communication between the client and {Project} or {SmartProxyServer}, which causes the update to fail.

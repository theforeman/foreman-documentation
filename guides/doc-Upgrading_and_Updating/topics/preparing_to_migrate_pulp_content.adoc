= Preparing to Migrate Content to Pulp 3

The time to prepare content for Pulp 3 depends on the amount of content and the number of Content Views.
For large systems, this can mean several days of downtime.
To prevent this, pre-migrate Pulp content while running the latest version of {ProjectServer} {ProjectVersionPrevious}.
This reduces the overall upgrade downtime.

During migration to Pulp 3, the amount of data stored in the `/var/lib/pulp/published/` directory can double in size.
Ensure that there is enough space on the `/var/lib/pulp` volume.
If the user runs `{foreman-maintain} prep-6.10-upgrade`, the content in `/var/lib/pulp/content` does not need to be duplicated.
After Pulp 2 is removed, the extra space can be claimed back.
However, shrinking of XFS volumes is not possible.
Copying data to a different partition might be necessary in order to bring volume size down to the previous value.

During migration to Pulp 3, the amount of data stored in the PostgreSQL data directory can grow significantly.
Ensure that you have enough space for the migration.
A rough estimation of the space you require is 2-3 times the size of the MongoDB Pulp 2 database.

.Pre-Migration Checks
The sequence should always be if you have any Composite Content Views, take action on those first, and then work on the Content Views.

* Ensure that all enabled repositories complete the synchronization process.
* If any repositories are synced with a *Warning* or *Error* state, fix the underlying problem and resync the repository.
* If the Pulp 2 to Pulp 3 migration fails with the error `NoMethodError: undefined method `link?' for nil:NilClass`, see the Red Hat Knowledgebase solution https://access.redhat.com/solutions/6898881[The Pulp 2 to Pulp 3 migration fails with error "NoMethodError: undefined method `link?' for nil:NilClass" in Red Hat Satellite 6.9] on the customer portal.
* Ensure that no paused tasks in the system are related to any repositories or Content Views.
* If some Content View or Composite Content View versions are not required anymore, please consider performing a cleanup of them.
* For more information about how to perform the cleanup of older Content View or Composite Content View versions using `hammer_cli`, see https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2760531[How to remove old content view versions in Red Hat Satellite 6 using CLI/hammer?].
* If you no longer require or use certain repositories, disable those specific repositories.
* When the cleanup process finishes, ensure that you clean up the orphan data by following the steps in https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2639291[How to delete orphaned content in /var/lib/pulp on Capsule?].
* Ensure that you can enter the following command on {Project} without error:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# foreman-rake katello:correct_repositories COMMIT=true --trace
----
//foreman-rake katello:correct_repositories COMMIT=true --trace.

Use this procedure to begin migrating content from Pulp 2 to Pulp 3.

.Procedure
. Update the file permissions before upgrading {ProjectServer} using the following command:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} prep-{TargetVersion}-upgrade
----
+
This might take some time on high latency systems.
. View details of the content you are pre-migrating using the following command:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} content migration-stats
----
+
Use this command as often as necessary during the migration process to determine how long the process will take.
It also identifies corrupted or missing content that might cause the migration to fail.
Output is similar to the following:

Running Retrieve Pulp 2 to Pulp 3 migration statistics
============================================
Retrieve Pulp 2 to Pulp 3 migration statistics:
============Migration Summary================
Migrated/Total RPMs: 0/367633
Migrated/Total errata: 0/20780140
Migrated/Total repositories: 0/33924
Estimated migration time based on yum content: 47 hours, 23 minutes
Note: ensure there is sufficient storage space for /var/lib/pulp/published to
double in size before starting the migration process.
Check the size of /var/lib/pulp/published with 'du -sh /var/lib/pulp/published/'
Note: ensure there is sufficient storage space for postgresql.
You will need additional space for your postgresql database.
The partition holding '/var/opt/rh/rh-postgresql12/lib/pgsql/data/' will need
additional free space equivalent to the size of your Mongo db database (/var/lib/mongodb/).
[OK]

. Prepare your content for Pulp migration using the following command:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} content prepare
----
+
As part of its final step, `{foreman-maintain} content prepare` checks whether any content units are unmigrated.
If it identifies corrupted or missing content, you might see something similar to the following:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]

============Missing/Corrupted Content Summary================
  WARNING: MISSING OR CORRUPTED CONTENT DETECTED
  Corrupted or Missing Rpm: 1000/104583
  Corrupted or missing content has been detected, you can examine the list of content in /tmp/unmigratable_content-20211025-74422-16cxfae and take action by either:
  1. Performing a 'Verify Checksum' sync under Advanced Sync Options, let it complete, and re-running the migration
  2. Deleting/disabling the affected repositories and running orphan cleanup (foreman-rake katello:delete_orphaned_content) and re-running the migration.
  3. Manually correcting files on the filesystem in /var/lib/pulp/content/ and re-running the migration
  4. Mark currently corrupted or missing content as skipped (foreman-rake katello:approve_corrupted_migration_content). This will skip migration of missing or corrupted content.
----
+
There are several causes of corrupted or missing content:

  * A Repository synchronization or Content View publish or promotion occurred during the migration.
  * Files on disk in `/var/lib/pulp/content/` became corrupted due to disk rot.
  * Files in `/var/lib/pulp/content/` are missing due to past events such as disk loss with a partial restore.
  * There is some mismatch between subsystems in {Project} such as Katello and Pulp.
  This can happen if a repository or content view is improperly deleted by skipping steps in a paused {ProjectName} Task.
  Running `foreman-rake katello:correct_repositories COMMIT=true` can correct this.
+
You can review the list of corrupt or missing RPMs written to disk as part of the `{foreman-maintain} content migration-stats command`, `/tmp/unmigratable_content-20211025-74422-16cxfae20211120-2149-1j4pmfae` in the example above.
+
For more information about determining which repository the unmigratable contents belong to, see https://access.redhat.com/solutions/6629271[How to determine the repository to run Verify Checksum on for reported corrupted RPMs].
+
In most cases, where repositories with unmigratable contents are configured on {Project} with the *On-demand* download policy and the number of missing or corrupt RPMs are low, you can mark these as skipped using the command:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
# foreman-rake katello:approve_corrupted_migration_content
----
+
If you approve corrupted or missing content and proceed with the upgrade, that content will not appear in the repositories or content view versions after upgrade.
+
If these packages exist in the upstream repositories, they are added again when you re-synchronize the repositories after upgrade.
They are not restored to the Content Views unless you republish those Content Views.
As these packages are likely unusable, the upgrade process only detects that fact.
+
If you suspect a Repository synchronization or Content View publish or promotion occurred during the migration, re-running `{foreman-maintain} content prepare` migrates the remaining content.
If this is the first time you have run `{foreman-maintain} content prepare`, {Team} recommends running it as often as necessary to try to reduce the number of corrupt or missing RPMs.
Migrating the remaining content then takes less time.
+
[NOTE]
====
You cannot use *`Ctrl` + `C`* to terminate the `{foreman-maintain} content prepare` process.
If you attempt to halt the process using *`Ctrl` + `C`* or by disconnecting your SSH session, the process does not terminate but continues in the background.
You can use the following command to terminate the process gracefully, whenever necessary, so that you can continue later.

[options="nowrap", subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} content prepare-abort
----

Note that `{foreman-maintain} content prepare-abort` can take several minutes to terminate the process.
You can continue the migration process using `{foreman-maintain} content prepare` whenever it is convenient.
====
+
. The process does not confirm that migration is complete.
You can determine how near to completion the process is by using the following command:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} content migration-stats
----
+
at intervals until the indicated migration time is at or near zero.
. The final steps of Pulp content migration are completed when upgrading {ProjectServer} from {ProjectVersionPrevious} to {ProjectVersion}.
+
[NOTE]
====
If problems occur, you must restart the pre-migration process from the beginning using the following command:
[options="nowrap", subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} content migration-reset
----
====

. The final steps of Pulp content migration are completed when upgrading {ProjectServer} from {ProjectVersionPrevious} to {ProjectVersion}.

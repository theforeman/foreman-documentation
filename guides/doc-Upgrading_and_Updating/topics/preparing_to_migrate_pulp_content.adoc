= Preparing to Migrate Content to Pulp 3

The time to prepare content for Pulp 3 depends on the amount of content and the number of content views.
For large systems, this can mean several days of downtime.
To prevent this, pre-migrate Pulp content while running the latest version of {ProjectServer} {ProjectVersionPrevious}.
This reduces the overall upgrade downtime.

During migration to Pulp3, the amount of data stored in the `/var/lib/pulp/published/` directory can double in size.
Ensure that there is enough space on the `/var/lib/pulp` volume.
If the user runs `{foreman-maintain} prep-6.10-upgrade`, the content in `/var/lib/pulp/content` does not need to be duplicated.
After Pulp2 is removed, the extra space can be claimed back, however, shrinking of XFS volumes is not possible and copying data to a different partition might be necessary in order to bring volume size down to the previous value.

During migration to Pulp 3, the amount of data stored in the PostgreSQL data directory can grow significantly.
Ensure that you have enough space for the migration.
A rough estimation of the space you require is 2-3 times the size of the MongoDB Pulp 2 database.

.Pre-Migration Recommendations
. Ensure that all enabled repositories are synced properly. If any repositories are synced with a *Warning* or *Error* state, fix the underlying problem and resync the repository.

. Ensure no paused tasks in the system are related to any repositories or content views. If there are any:

* Investigate the underlying problem and resume the task to have it completed successfully.

. If a paused content view task is being cleaned up or has been deleted without fixing the underlying cause, ensure that the related broken version of the content view is being deleted as it is already an unusable version.

. If some content view or Composite content view versions are not required anymore, please consider performing a cleanup of them. This solution article https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2760531 can be referred to understand how to perform the cleanup of older content view/Composite content view versions using `hammer_cli`.

[NOTE]
====
The sequence should always be if you have any Composite content views, take action on those first, and then work on the content views.
====

. If some repositories are not needed anymore or not in use anymore, consider disabling the repository in question.

. Once the cleanup process has been concluded, ensure to clean up the orphan data by following the steps from https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2639291.

. Ensure that the following command is getting executed on Satellite without showing any problems:

* `foreman-rake katello:correct_repositories COMMIT=true --trace`.

Use this procedure to begin migrating content from Pulp 2 to Pulp 3.

.Procedure
. View details of the content you are pre-migrating using the following command:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} content migration-stats
----
+
Use this command as often as necessary during the migration process to determine how long the process will take.
It also identifies corrupted or missing content that might cause the migration to fail.
Output is similar to the following:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]

Estimated migration time based on yum content: 47 hours, 23 minutes
Note: ensure there is sufficient storage space for /var/lib/pulp/published to
double in size before starting the migration process.
Check the size of /var/lib/pulp/published with 'du -sh /var/lib/pulp/published/'

. Update the file permissions before upgrading {ProjectServer} using the following command:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} prep-{TargetVersion}-upgrade

endif::[]

This might take some time on high latency systems.
. Prepare your content for Pulp migration using the following command:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} content prepare

[NOTE]
====
You cannot use *`Ctrl` + `C`* to terminate this process.
If you attempt to halt the process using *`Ctrl` + `C`* or by disconnecting your SSH session, the process does not terminate but continues in the background.
You can use the following command to terminate the process gracefully, whenever necessary, so that you can continue later.

[options="nowrap", subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} content prepare-abort
----

Note that `{foreman-maintain} content-prepare abort` can take several minutes to terminate the process.
You can continue the migration process using `{foreman-maintain} content-prepare` whenever it is convenient.
====

. The process does not confirm that migration is complete.
You can determine how near the process is to completion by using:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} content migration-stats
----
+
at intervals until the indicated migration time is at or near zero.
. The final steps of Pulp content migration are completed when upgrading {ProjectServer} from {ProjectVersionPrevious} to {ProjectVersion}.

[NOTE]
====
If problems occur, you can restart the pre-migration process from the beginning using the following command:

[options="nowrap", subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} content migration-reset

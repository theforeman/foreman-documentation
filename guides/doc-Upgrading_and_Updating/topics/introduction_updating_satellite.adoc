[[introduction_updating_satellite]]

Use this chapter to update your existing {ProjectServer}, {SmartProxyServer}, and Content Hosts to a new minor version, for example, from {ProjectVersion}.0 to {ProjectVersion}.1.

Updates patch security vulnerabilities and minor issues discovered after code is released, and are often fast and non-disruptive to your operating environment.

Before updating, back up your {ProjectServer} and all {SmartProxyServer}s.
For more information, see {AdministeringDocURL}backing-up-satellite-server-and-capsule-server[Backing Up {ProjectServer} and {SmartProxyServer}] in the _Administering {ProjectName}_ guide.

= Upgrading Discovery

This section describes updating the PXELinux template and the boot image passed to hosts that use PXE booting to register themselves with {ProjectServer}.

From {ProjectXY}, provisioning templates now have a separate association with a subnet, and do not default to using the TFTP {SmartProxy} for that subnet. If you create subnets after the upgrade, you must specifically enable the {Project} or a {SmartProxy} to provide a proxy service for discovery templates and then configure all subnets with discovered hosts to use a specific _template {SmartProxy}_.

During the upgrade, for every subnet with a TFTP proxy enabled, the template {SmartProxy} is set to be the same as the TFTP {SmartProxy}. After the upgrade, check all subnets to verify this was set correctly.

These procedures are not required if you do not use PXE booting of hosts to enable {Project} to discover new hosts.

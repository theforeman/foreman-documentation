[[cloning_satellite_server]]

= Cloning {ProjectServer}

When you upgrade {ProjectServer}, you can optionally create a clone of your {Project} to ensure that you do not lose any data while you upgrade.
After your upgrade is complete, you can then decommission the earlier version of {ProjectServer}.

Use the following procedures to clone your {Project} instances to preserve your environments in preparation for upgrade.

The {Project} clone tool does not support migrating a {SmartProxyServer} to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.
Instead you must backup the existing {SmartProxyServer}, restore it on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, then reconfigure {SmartProxyServer}.

.Terminology
Ensure that you understand the following terms:

*Source server*: the server that you clone

*Target server*: the new server that you copy files to and clone the source server to.


[[sec-Cloning_Workflow_Overview]]
== Cloning Process Overview

. Back up the source server.
. Clone the source server to the target server.
. Power off the source server.
. Update the network configuration on the target server to match the target server’s IP address with its new host name.
. Restart *goferd* in Content hosts and {SmartProxies} to refresh the connection.
. Test the new target server.


[[sec-Cloning_Prerequisites]]
== Prerequisites

To clone {ProjectServer}, ensure that you have the following resources available:

* A minimal install of Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise Linux 7 server to become the target server.
Do not install Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise Linux 7 software groups, or third-party applications.
Ensure that your server complies with all the specifications of {InstallingProjectDocURL}preparing-environment-for-satellite-installation[Preparing your Environment for Installation] in _Installing {ProjectServer}_.
* A backup from {Project} {ProjectVersionPrevious} that you make using the `{foreman-maintain} backup` script.
You can use a backup with or without Pulp data.
* A {Project} subscription for the target server.

Before you begin cloning, ensure the following conditions exist:

* The target server is on an isolated network.
This avoids unwanted communication with {SmartProxyServer}s and hosts
* The target server has the capacity to store all your backup files from the source server.

.Customized configuration files

If you have any customized configurations on your source server that are not managed by the `{foreman-installer}` tool or {Project} backup process, you must manually back up these files.

[[sec-Pulp_Data_Considerations]]
== Pulp Data Considerations

You can clone {Project} server without including Pulp data.
However, for your cloned environment to work, you do require Pulp data.
If the target server does not have Pulp data. it is not a fully working {Project}.

To transfer Pulp data to a target server, you have two options:

* Clone using backup with Pulp data
* Clone using backup without Pulp data and copy `/var/lib/pulp` manually from source server.

If your `pulp_data.tar` file is greater than 500 GB, or if you use a slow storage system, such as NFS, and your `pulp_data.tar` file is greater than 100 GB, do not include `pulp_data.tar` in the backup because this can cause memory errors during extraction.
Copy the `pulp_data.tar` file from the source server to the target server.

.To back up without Pulp data

Follow the steps in the procedure in xref:sec_Cloning_Satellite_Server[] and replace the steps that involve cloning with Pulp data with the following steps:

. Perform a backup with MongoDB and PostgreSQL databases active excluding the Pulp data:
+
[options="nowrap"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} backup offline --skip-pulp-content \
--assumeyes /var/backup
----
+
. Stop and disable the `{foreman-maintain}` services
+
[options="nowrap"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} service stop
# {foreman-maintain} service disable
----
+
. Copy the Pulp data to the target server:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# rsync --archive --partial --progress --compress \
/var/lib/pulp _target_server.example.com:/var/lib/pulp_
----

Proceed to xref:sec-Cloning_to_Target[].


[[sec_Cloning_Satellite_Server]]
== Cloning {ProjectServer}

Use the following procedures to clone {ProjectServer}. Note that because of the high volume of data that you must copy and transfer as part of these procedures, it can take a significant amount of time to complete.

[[sec-Preparing_Source_Server]]
=== Preparing the source server for cloning

On the source server, complete the following steps:

. Verify the Pool ID of your {Project} subscription:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# subscription-manager list --consumed \
--matches '{ProjectName}'|grep "_Pool ID_:"|awk '{print $3}'
----
+
Note the _Pool ID_ for later use.
+
. Remove the {ProjectName} subscription.
+
[options="nowrap"]
----
# subscription-manager remove --serial=$(subscription-manager list \
--consumed \
--matches '{ProjectName}'|grep "Serial:"|awk '{print $2}')
----
+
. Determine the size of the Pulp data:
+
[options="nowrap"]
----
# du -sh /var/lib/pulp/
----
+
. If you have less than 500 GB of Pulp data, perform a backup with MongoDB and PostgreSQL databases active including the Pulp data.
If you have more than 500 GB of Pulp data, skip the following steps and complete the steps in xref:sec-Pulp_Data_Considerations[] before you continue.
+
[options="nowrap"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} backup offline --assumeyes /var/backup
----
+
. Stop and disable the `{foreman-maintain}` services:
+
[options="nowrap"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} service stop
# {foreman-maintain} service disable
----


Proceed to xref:sec-Cloning_to_Target[].

[[sec-Cloning_to_Target]]
=== Cloning to the Target Server

To clone your server, complete the following steps on your target server:

. The `satellite-clone` tool defaults to using `/backup/` as the backup folder.
If you copy to a different folder, update the `backup_dir` variable in the `/etc/satellite-clone/satellite-clone-vars.yml` file.
. Place the backup files from the source {Project} in the `/backup/` folder on the target server.
You can either mount the shared storage or copy the backup files to the `/backup/` folder on the target server.
. Power off the source server.
. Enter the following commands to register to the Customer Portal, attach subscriptions, and enable only the required subscriptions:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="quotes, attributes"]
----
# subscription-manager register _your_customer_portal_credentials_
# subscription-manager attach --pool=__pool_ID__
# subscription-manager repos --disable=*
# subscription-manager repos \
--enable=rhel-7-server-rpms \
--enable=rhel-server-rhscl-7-rpms \
--enable=rhel-7-server-satellite-maintenance-6-rpms \
--enable=rhel-7-server-satellite-{ProjectVersionPrevious}-rpms
----
+
. Install the `satellite-clone` package
+
[options="nowrap"]
----
# {package-install-project} satellite-clone
----
+
After you install the `satellite-clone` tool, you can adjust any configuration to suit your own deployment in the `/etc/satellite-clone/satellite-clone-vars.yml` file.
+
. Run the `satellite-clone` tool.
+
[options="nowrap"]
----
# satellite-clone
----
+
. Reconfigure DHCP, DNS, TFTP and remote execution services.
The cloning process disables these services on the target {ProjectServer} to avoid conflict with the source {ProjectServer}.
. Reconfigure and enable DHCP, DNS, TFTP in the {Project} web UI.
For more information, see {InstallingProjectDocURL}configuring-external-services[Configuring External Services on {ProjectServer}] in _Installing {ProjectServer}_.
. Enable remote execution:
+
[options="nowrap"]
----
# {installer-scenario} \
--enable-foreman-plugin-remote-execution \
--enable-foreman-proxy-plugin-remote-execution-ssh
----
+
. Log on to the {Project} web UI, with the username `admin` and the password `changeme`.
Immediately update the admin password to secure credentials.
. Ensure that the correct organization is selected.
. Navigate to *Content* > *Subscriptions*, then click *Manage Manifest*.
. Click the *Refresh* button, then click *Close* to return to the list of subscriptions.
. Verify that the available subscriptions are correct.
. Follow the instructions in the `/usr/share/satellite-clone/logs/reassociate_capsules.txt` file to restore the associations between {SmartProxies} and their lifecycle environments.
. Update your network configuration, for example, DNS, to match the target server’s IP address with its new host name.
The `satellite-clone` tool changes the hostname to the source server's hostname.
If you want to change the hostname to something different, you can use the `satellite-change-hostname` tool.
For more information, see {AdministeringDocURL}sect-Red_Hat_Satellite-Administering_Red_Hat_Satellite-Renaming_a_Server[Renaming a {Project} or {SmartProxyServer}] in _Administrating {ProjectName}_.
. If the source server uses the `virt-who` daemon, install and configure it on the target server.
Copy all the `virt-who` configuration files in the `/etc/virt-who.d/` directory from the source server to the same directory on the target server.
For more information, see {BaseURL}configuring_virtual_machine_subscriptions_in_red_hat_satellite/index[_Configuring Virtual Machine Subscriptions in {ProjectName}_].
After you perform an upgrade using the following chapters, you can safely decommission the source server.

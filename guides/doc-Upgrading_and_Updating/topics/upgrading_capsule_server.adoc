= Upgrading {SmartProxyServer}s

This section describes how to upgrade {SmartProxyServer}s from {ProjectVersionPrevious} to {ProjectVersion}.

.Before You Begin

* You must upgrade {ProjectServer} before you can upgrade any {SmartProxyServer}s.
Note that you can upgrade {SmartProxies} separately from {Project}.
For more information, see xref:Upgrading_Proxies_Separately_from_Server_{context}[].

* Ensure the {ProjectName} {SmartProxy} {ProjectVersion} repository is enabled in {ProjectServer} and synchronized.
* Ensure that you synchronize the required repositories on {ProjectServer}.
For more information, see xref:synchronizing_the_new_repositories[].
endif::[]
* If you use Content Views to control updates to the base operating system of {SmartProxyServer}, update those Content Views with new repositories and publish their updated versions.
For more information, see {ContentManagementDocURL}Managing_Content_Views_content-management[Managing Content Views] in the _Content Management Guide_.
* Ensure the {SmartProxy}'s base system is registered to the newly upgraded {ProjectServer}.
* Ensure the {SmartProxy} has the correct organization and location settings in the newly upgraded {ProjectServer}.
* Review and update your firewall configuration prior to upgrading your {SmartProxyServer}.
For more information, see {InstallingSmartProxyDocURL}preparing-environment-for-capsule-installation[Preparing Your Environment for {SmartProxy} Installation] in _Installing {SmartProxyServer}_.

[WARNING]
====
If you implemented custom certificates, you must retain the content of both the `/root/ssl-build` directory and the directory in which you created any source files associated with your custom certificates.

Failure to retain these files during an upgrade causes the upgrade to fail.
If these files have been deleted, they must be restored from a backup in order for the upgrade to proceed.

.Upgrading {SmartProxyServer}s

. Create a backup.
+
* On a virtual machine, take a snapshot.
* On a physical machine, create a backup.
+
For information on backups, see {AdministeringDocURL}Backing_Up_Server_and_Proxy_admin[Backing Up {ProjectServer} and {SmartProxyServer}] in the _Administering {ProjectName} {ProjectVersionPrevious}_ guide.

+
. Regenerate certificates.
On the main {Project} server:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="attributes"]
----
# {certs-generate} --foreman-proxy-fqdn "myproxy.example.com" \
                       --certs-update-all \
                       --certs-tar "~/myproxy.example.com-certs.tar"
----
+
. Copy the resulting tarball to your {SmartProxy}, for this example we will use `/root/myproxy.example.com-certs.tar`
endif::[]
ifdef::katello[]
. Update repositories for EL7
+
[options="nowrap" subs="attributes"]
----
# yum update -y https://yum.theforeman.org/katello/{KatelloVersion}/katello/el7/x86_64/katello-repos-latest.rpm \
                https://yum.theforeman.org/releases/{ProjectVersion}/el7/x86_64/foreman-release.rpm
----
. Update repositories for EL8
+
[options="nowrap" subs="attributes"]
----
# yum update -y https://yum.theforeman.org/katello/{KatelloVersion}/katello/el8/x86_64/katello-repos-latest.rpm \
                https://yum.theforeman.org/releases/{ProjectVersion}/el8/x86_64/foreman-release.rpm
----
. Clean yum cache:
+
----
# yum clean metadata
----
+
. Update Packages:
+
----
# yum update -y
----
+
. Run the installer:
+
----
# foreman-installer --certs-tar-file /root/myproxy.example.com-certs.tar \
                    --certs-update-all --certs-regenerate true --certs-deploy true
----
endif::[]
ifdef::satellite[]
. Clean yum cache:
+
----
# yum clean metadata
----
+
. The `rubygem-foreman_maintain` is installed from the {Project} Maintenance repository or upgraded from the {Project} Maintenance repository if currently installed.
+
Ensure {SmartProxy} has access to `{RepoRHEL7ServerSatelliteMaintenanceProductVersion}` and execute:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} self-upgrade
----

. On {SmartProxyServer}, verify that the `foreman_url` setting points to the {Project} FQDN:
+
----
# grep foreman_url /etc/foreman-proxy/settings.yml
----

. Check the available versions to confirm the version you want is listed:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} upgrade list-versions
----

. Because of the lengthy upgrade time, use a utility such as `screen` to suspend and reattach a communication session.
You can then check the upgrade progress without staying connected to the command shell continuously.
For more information about using the screen command, see link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/5247[How do I use the screen command?] article in the _Red{nbsp}Hat Knowledge{nbsp}Base_.
+
If you lose connection to the command shell where the upgrade command is running you can see the logged messages in the `{installer-log-file}` file to check if the process completed successfully.

. Use the health check option to determine if the system is ready for upgrade:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} upgrade check --target-version {TargetVersion}
----
+
Review the results and address any highlighted error conditions before performing the upgrade.

. Perform the upgrade:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} upgrade run --target-version {TargetVersion}
----
+
endif::[]
. Check when the kernel packages were last updated:
+
[options="nowrap"]
----
# rpm -qa --last | grep kernel
----

. Optional: If a kernel update occurred since the last reboot, reboot the system:
+
----
# reboot
----

. Optional: If you made manual edits to DNS or DHCP configuration files, check and restore any changes required to the DNS and DHCP configuration files using the backups made earlier.
. Optional: If you use custom repositories, ensure that you enable these custom repositories after the upgrade completes.

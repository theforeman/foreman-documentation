= Upgrade Overview

This chapter details the prerequisites and available upgrade paths to {ProjectName} {ProjectVersion}.
Review this information before upgrading your current {ProjectName} installation.

In this guide, the terms update, upgrade, and migrate have the following meanings:

Upgrading::
The process of advancing your {ProjectServer} and {SmartProxyServer} installations from a y-stream release to the next, for example {Project} {ProjectVersionPrevious} to {Project} {ProjectVersion}.
Updating::
The process of advancing your {ProjectServer} and {SmartProxyServer} installations from a z-stream release to the next, for example {Project} {ProjectVersion}.0 to {Project} {ProjectVersion}.1.
Migrating::
The process of moving an existing {Project} installation to another hardware.

For interactive upgrade instructions, you can also use the {ProjectName} Upgrade Helper on the Red{nbsp}Hat Customer Portal.
This application provides you with an exact guide to match your current version number.
You can find instructions that are specific to your upgrade path, as well as steps to prevent known issues.
For more information, see https://access.redhat.com/labs/satelliteupgradehelper/[{Project} Upgrade Helper] on the customer portal.

Note that you can upgrade {SmartProxies} separately from {Project}.
For more information, see xref:Upgrading_Proxies_Separately_from_Server_{context}[].

[[upgrading_prerequisites]]
== Prerequisites

Upgrading to {Project} {ProjectVersion} affects your entire {Project} infrastructure.
Before proceeding, complete the following:

* Read the {ProjectName} {ProjectVersion} {ReleaseNotesURL}[Release Notes].
* Review this guide so that you are aware of the upgrade process and its impact.
* Plan your upgrade path.
For more information, see xref:upgrade_paths[].
* Plan for the required downtime. {Project} services are shut down during the upgrade.
The upgrade process duration might vary depending on your hardware configuration, network speed, and the amount of data that is stored on the server.
+
Upgrading {Project} takes approximately 1{range}2 hours.
+
Upgrading {SmartProxy} takes approximately 10{range}30 minutes.

* Ensure that you have sufficient storage space on your server.
For more information, see {InstallingProjectDocURL}Preparing_your_Environment_for_Installation_{project-context}[Preparing your Environment for Installation] in _Installing {ProjectServer} from a Connected Network_ and {InstallingSmartProxyDocURL}preparing-environment-for-capsule-installation[Preparing your Environment for Installation] in _Installing {SmartProxyServer}_.

* Back up your {ProjectServer} and all {SmartProxyServer}s.
For more information, see {AdministeringDocURL}Backing_Up_Server_and_Proxy_admin[Backing Up {ProjectServer} and {SmartProxyServer}] in the _Administering {ProjectName}_ guide.

* Plan for updating any scripts you use that contain {Project} API commands because some API commands differ between versions of {Project}.
For more information about changes in the API, see the Red Hat Knowledgebase article https://access.redhat.com/articles/4396911[API Changes Between {Project} Versions] on the Red{nbsp}Hat Customer Portal.

[WARNING]
If you customize configuration files, manually or use a tool such as Hiera, these customizations are overwritten when the installation script runs during upgrading or updating.
You can use the `--noop` option with the {foreman-installer} script to test for changes.
For more information, see the Red Hat Knowledgebase solution https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3351311[How to use the noop option to check for changes in {Project} config files during an upgrade.]


[[upgrade_paths]]
== Upgrade Paths

ifdef::satellite[]
You can upgrade to {ProjectName} {ProjectVersion} from {ProjectName} {ProjectVersionPrevious}.
{ProjectServer}s and {SmartProxyServer}s on earlier versions must first be upgraded to {Project} {ProjectVersionPrevious}.
For more information, see the {Project} {ProjectVersionPrevious} https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_satellite/{ProjectVersionPrevious}/html/upgrading_and_updating_red_hat_satellite/[Upgrading and Updating {ProjectName}] guide.

. Upgrade {ProjectServer} to {ProjectVersion}.
For more information, see xref:Upgrading_Server_{context}[].
. Upgrade all {SmartProxyServer}s to {ProjectVersion}. For more information, see xref:upgrading_capsule_server[].
ifdef::katello,orcharhino,satellite[]

[[following_the_progress_of_the_upgrade]]
== Following the Progress of the Upgrade

Because of the lengthy upgrade time, use a utility such as `screen` to suspend and reattach a communication session.
You can then check the upgrade progress without staying connected to the command shell continuously.
For more information about using the screen command, see link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/5247[How do I use the screen command?] article in the _Red{nbsp}Hat Knowledge{nbsp}Base_.
For more information, see the `screen` manual page.

If you lose connection to the command shell where the upgrade command is running you can see the logs in `{installer-log-file}` to check if the process completed successfully.

= Migrating Content to Pulp 3

The time to prepare content for Pulp 3 depends on the amount of content and the number of content views.
For large systems, this can mean several days of downtime.
To prevent this, {Team} recommends that you pre-migrate Pulp content while running the latest version of {ProjectServer} {ProjectVersionPrevious}.
This reduces the overall upgrade downtime.

Use this procedure to begin migrating content from Pulp 2 to Pulp 3.

.Procedure
. View details of the content you are pre-migrating using the following command:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} content migration-stats
----
+
Use this command as often as necessary during the migration process to determine how long the process will take.
It also identifies corrupted or missing content that might cause the migration to fail.
Output is similar to the following:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]

============Migration Summary================
Migrated/Total RPMs: 0/367633
Migrated/Total errata: 0/20780140
Migrated/Total repositories: 0/33924
Estimated migration time based on yum content: 47 hours, 23 minutes
Note: ensure there is sufficient storage space for /var/lib/pulp/published to
double in size before starting the migration process.
Check the size of /var/lib/pulp/published with 'du -sh /var/lib/pulp/published/'
[OK]

. Update the file permissions before upgrading {ProjectServer} using the following:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} prep-{TargetVersion}-upgrade
----
+
This might take some time on high latency systems.
. Prepare your content for Pulp migration using the following command:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} content-prepare
----
+
You cannot use `*Ctrl*` *+* `*C*` to terminate this process. If a user attempts to halt the process using CTRL + C or by disconnecting their SSH session, the process does not terminate but continues in the background.
You can use the following command to terminate the process gracefully, whenever necessary, so that you can continue later.
+
[options="nowrap", subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} content-prepare abort
----
+
Note that `{foreman-maintain} content-prepare abort` can take several minutes to terminate the process.
. Continue the migration process using `{foreman-maintain} content-prepare` whenever it is convenient.
. If problems occur you can restart the pre-migration process from the beginning:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} content migration-reset
----
. The migration process is not fully complete until the upgrade of {ProjectServer} from {ProjectVersionPrevious} to {ProjectVersion} is complete.

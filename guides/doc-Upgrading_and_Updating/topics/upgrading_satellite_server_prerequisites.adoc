.Before You Begin

* Note that you can upgrade {SmartProxies} separately from {Project}.
For more information, see xref:Upgrading_Proxies_Separately_from_Server_{context}[].
* Review and update your firewall configuration prior to upgrading your {ProjectServer}.
For more information, see {InstallingServerDocURL}Preparing_your_Environment_for_Installation_{project-context}[Preparing your environment for installation] in _{InstallingServerDocTitle}_.

* Ensure that you do not delete the manifest from the Customer Portal or in the {ProjectWebUI} because this removes all the entitlements of your content hosts.
endif::[]
* If you have edited any of the default templates, back up the files either by cloning or exporting them.
Cloning is the recommended method because that prevents them being overwritten in future updates or upgrades.
To confirm if a template has been edited, you can view its *History* before you upgrade or view the changes in the audit log after an upgrade.
In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Monitor* > *Audits* and search for the template to see a record of changes made.
If you use the export method, restore your changes by comparing the exported template and the default template, manually applying your changes.

.{SmartProxy} Considerations

ifdef::katello,orcharhino,satellite[]
* If you use Content Views to control updates to a {SmartProxyServer}â€™s base operating system, or for {SmartProxyServer} repository, you must publish updated versions of those Content Views.
endif::[]
* Note that {ProjectServer} upgraded from {ProjectVersionPrevious} to {ProjectVersion} can use {SmartProxyServers} still at {ProjectVersionPrevious}.

[WARNING]
====
If you implemented custom certificates, you must retain the content of both the `/root/ssl-build` directory and the directory in which you created any source files associated with your custom
certificates.

Failure to retain these files during an upgrade causes the upgrade to fail.
If these files have been deleted, they must be restored from a backup in order for the upgrade to proceed.

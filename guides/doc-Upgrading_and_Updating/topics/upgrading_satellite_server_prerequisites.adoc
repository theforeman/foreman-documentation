[[upgrading_satellite_server_prerequisites]]

.Before You Begin

* Note that you can upgrade {SmartProxies} separately from {Project}. For more information, see xref:upgrading_capsules-separately-from-satellite_upgrade-guide[].
* Review and update your firewall configuration prior to upgrading your {ProjectServer}. For more information, see {InstallingProjectDocURL}preparing-environment-for-satellite-installation[Preparing your environment for installation] in _Installing {ProjectServer}_.
* Ensure that you do not delete the manifest from the Customer Portal or in the {Project} Web UI because this removes all the entitlements of your content hosts.
* Back up and remove all Foreman hooks before upgrading. Restore any hooks only after {Project} is known to be working after the upgrade is complete.
* If you have edited any of the default templates, back up the files either by cloning or exporting them. Cloning is the recommended method because that prevents them being overwritten in future updates or upgrades. To confirm if a template has been edited, you can view its *History* before you upgrade or view the changes in the audit log after an upgrade. In the web UI, Navigate to *Monitor* > *Audits* and search for the template to see a record of changes made. If you use the export method, restore your changes by comparing the exported template and the default template, manually applying your changes.

.{SmartProxy} Considerations

* If you use Content Views to control updates to a {SmartProxyServer}â€™s base operating system, or for the {SmartProxyServer} repository, you must publish updated versions of those Content Views.


[WARNING]
====
If you implemented custom certificates, you must retain the content of both the `/root/ssl-build` directory and the directory in which you created any source files associated with your custom
certificates.

Failure to retain these files during an upgrade causes the upgrade to fail. If
these files have been deleted, they must be restored from a backup in order for
the upgrade to proceed.
====

.Configuring the BASH shell
The BASH shell stores the location of a binary in a hash table. During the upgrade, the location of the `{foreman-maintain}` script is changed, but BASH does not register this change, and `{foreman-maintain}` fails if it calls the script after the change.

** Optional: Before the upgrade, users of the BASH shell can set the `checkhash` option temporarily to ensure `{foreman-maintain}` works after the installer completes. Enter a command as follows in your BASH shell:
+
[options="nowrap"]
----
# shopt -s checkhash
----
** After a successful or failed upgrade, in all currently running BASH shells, enter the following command:
+
[options="nowrap"]
----
# hash -d {foreman-maintain} 2> /dev/null
----

= Upgrading a Disconnected {ProjectServer}

Use this procedure for a {ProjectServer} not connected to the Red{nbsp}Hat Content Delivery Network.

[WARNING]
If you customize configuration files, manually or using a tool such as Hiera, these changes are overwritten when you enter the `{foreman-maintain}` command during upgrading or updating.
You can use the `--noop` option with the `{foreman-installer}` command to review the changes that are applied during upgrading or updating.
For more information, see the Red Hat Knowledgebase solution https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3351311[How to use the noop option to check for changes in {Project} config files during an upgrade].


.Before You Begin

* Review and update your firewall configuration before upgrading your {ProjectServer}.
For more information, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_satellite/{AccessRedHatComVersion}/html-single/installing_satellite_server_from_a_disconnected_network/index#satellite-ports-and-firewalls-requirements_satellite[Ports and Firewalls Requirements] in _Installing {ProjectServer} from a Disconnected Network_.
* Ensure that you do not delete the manifest from the Customer Portal or in the {Project} web UI because this removes all the entitlements of your content hosts.
* Back up and remove all Foreman hooks before upgrading.
Reinstate hooks only after {Project} is known to be working after the upgrade is complete.

[WARNING]
====
If you implemented custom certificates, you must retain the content of both the `/root/ssl-build` directory and the directory in which you created any source files associated with your custom certificates.

Failure to retain these files during an upgrade causes the upgrade to fail.
If these files have been deleted, they must be restored from a backup in order for the upgrade to proceed.
====

.Upgrade Disconnected {ProjectServer}

. Create a backup.
+
* On a virtual machine, take a snapshot.
* On a physical machine, create a backup.

. A pre-upgrade script is available to detect conflicts and list hosts which have duplicate entries in {ProjectServer} that can be unregistered and deleted after upgrade.
In addition, it will detect hosts which are not assigned to an organization.
If a host is listed under *Hosts* > *All hosts* without an organization association and if a content host with same name has an organization already associated with it then the content host will automatically be unregistered.
This can be avoided by associating such hosts to an organization before upgrading.
+
Run the pre-upgrade check script to get a list of hosts that can be deleted after upgrading.
If any unassociated hosts are found, associating them to an organization before upgrading is recommended.

If the upgrade check reports a failure due to running tasks, then it is recommended that you wait for the tasks to complete.
It is possible to cancel some tasks, but you should follow the guidance in the Red{nbsp}Hat Knowledgebase solution https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2089951[How to manage paused tasks on {ProjectNameX}] to understand which tasks are safe to cancel and which are not safe to cancel.

. Optional: If you made manual edits to DNS or DHCP configuration in the `/etc/zones.conf` or `/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf` files, back up the configuration files because the installer only supports one domain or subnet, and therefore restoring changes from these backups might be required.

. Optional: If you made manual edits to DNS or DHCP configuration files and do not want to overwrite the changes, enter the following command:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="attributes"]
----
# {foreman-installer} --foreman-proxy-dns-managed=false \
--foreman-proxy-dhcp-managed=false
----

. Optional: If you use PostgreSQL as an external database, on the PostgreSQL server, install the `rh-postgresql12-postgresql-evr` package, which is available from the `{RepoRHEL7Server{Project}ServerProductVersion}` repository:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# yum install rh-postgresql12-postgresql-evr
----

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Hosts* > *Discovered hosts*.
If there are discovered hosts available, turn them off and then delete all entries under the `Discovered hosts` page.
Select all other organizations in turn using the organization setting menu and repeat this action as required.
Reboot these hosts after the upgrade has completed.

. Make sure all external {SmartProxyServer}s are assigned to an organization, otherwise they might get unregistered due to host-unification changes.

. Remove old repositories:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="attributes"]
----
# rm /etc/yum.repos.d/*
----

. Stop the `{foreman-maintain}` services.
+
[options="nowrap" subs="attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} service stop
----

. Obtain the latest ISO files by following the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_satellite/{AccessRedHatComVersion}/html-single/installing_satellite_server_from_a_disconnected_network/installing-satellite-server-disconnected#downloading-the-binary-dvd-images_satellite[Downloading the Binary DVD Images] procedure in the _Installing {ProjectServer} from a Disconnected Network_ guide.

. Create directories to serve as a mount point, mount the ISO images, and configure the `rhel7-server` repository by following the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_satellite/{AccessRedHatComVersion}/html-single/installing_satellite_server_from_a_disconnected_network/installing-satellite-server-disconnected#configuring-the-base-operating-system-with-offline-repositories_satellite[Configuring the Base System with Offline Repositories] procedure in the _Installing {ProjectServer} from a Disconnected Network_ guide.
Do not install or update any packages at this stage.

. Configure the {Project} {ProjectVersion} repository from the ISO file.

.. Copy the ISO file's repository data file for the {ProjectName} packages:
+
[options="nowrap"]
----
# cp /media/sat6/media.repo /etc/yum.repos.d/sat6.repo
----

.. Edit the `/etc/yum.repos.d/sat6.repo` file:
+
----
# vi /etc/yum.repos.d/sat6.repo
----

... Change the default `InstallMedia` repository name to `{Project}-{ProjectVersion}`:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
[{Project}-{ProjectVersion}]
----

... Add the `baseurl` directive:
+
[options="nowrap"]
----
baseurl=file:///media/sat6/
----

. Configure the Red Hat Software Collections repository from the ISO file.

.. Copy the ISO file's repository data file for Red Hat Software Collections packages:
+
[options="nowrap"]
----
# cp /media/sat6/RHSCL/media.repo /etc/yum.repos.d/RHSCL.repo
----

.. Edit the `/etc/yum.repos.d/RHSCL.repo` file:
+
[options="nowrap"]
----
# vi /etc/yum.repos.d/RHSCL.repo
----

... Change the default `InstallMedia` repository name to `RHSCL`:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
[RHSCL]
----

... Add the `baseurl` directive:
+
[options="nowrap"]
----
baseurl=file:///media/sat6/RHSCL/
----

. Configure the {ProjectName} Maintenance repository from the ISO file.

.. Copy the ISO file's repository data file for {ProjectName} Maintenance packages:
+
[options="nowrap"]
----
# cp /media/sat6/sat-maintenance/media.repo /etc/yum.repos.d/sat-maintenance.repo
----

.. Edit the `/etc/yum.repos.d/sat-maintenance.repo` file:
+
[options="nowrap"]
----
# vi /etc/yum.repos.d/sat-maintenance.repo
----

... Change the default `InstallMedia` repository name to `{Project}-Maintenance`:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
[{Project}-Maintenance]
----

... Add the `baseurl` directive:
+
[options="nowrap"]
----
baseurl=file:///media/sat6/sat-maintenance/
----

. Optional: If you have applied custom Apache server configurations, note that the custom configurations are reverted to the installation defaults when you perform the upgrade.
+
To preview the changes that are applied during the upgrade, enter the `{foreman-installer}` command with the `--noop` (no operation) option.
These changes are applied when you enter the `{foreman-maintain} upgrade` command in a following step.

.. Add the following line to the `/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf` configuration file.
+
[options="nowrap"]
----
Include /etc/httpd/conf.modules.d/*.conf
----

.. Restart the `httpd` service.
+
[options="nowrap"]
----
# systemctl restart httpd
----

.. Start the `postgresql` and `rh-mongodb34-mongod` database services.
+
[options="nowrap"]
----
# systemctl start postgresql
# systemctl start rh-mongodb34-mongod
----

.. Enter the `{foreman-installer}` command with the `--noop` option:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="attributes"]
----
# {installer-scenario} --upgrade --verbose --noop
----
Review the `{installer-log-file}` to preview the changes that are applied during the upgrade.
Locate the `\+++` and `---` symbols that indicate the changes to the configurations files.
Although entering the `{foreman-installer}` command with the `--noop` option does not apply any changes to your {Project}, some Puppet resources in the module expect changes to be applied and might display failure messages.

.. Stop the `{foreman-maintain}` services:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} service stop
----

. Because of the lengthy upgrade time, use a utility such as `screen` to suspend and reattach a communication session.
You can then check the upgrade progress without staying connected to the command shell continuously.
For more information about using the screen command, see link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/5247[How do I use the screen command?] article in the _Red{nbsp}Hat Knowledge{nbsp}Base_.
+
If you lose connection to the command shell where the upgrade command is running you can see the logs in `{installer-log-file}` to check if the process completed successfully.

. Check the available versions to confirm the version you want is listed:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} upgrade list-versions
----

. Use the health check option to determine if the system is ready for upgrade.
When prompted, enter the hammer admin user credentials to configure `{foreman-maintain}` with hammer credentials.
These changes are applied to the `/etc/foreman-maintain/foreman-maintain-hammer.yml` file.
+
[options="nowrap" subs="attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} upgrade check --target-version {TargetVersionMaintainUpgrade} \
--whitelist="repositories-validate,repositories-setup"
----
+
Review the results and address any highlighted error conditions before performing the upgrade.
. Perform the upgrade:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} upgrade run --target-version {TargetVersionMaintainUpgrade} \
--whitelist="repositories-validate,repositories-setup"
----
+
[WARNING]
====
If you run the command from a directory containing a *_config_* subdirectory, you will encounter the following error:
[options="nowrap"]
----
ERROR: Scenario (config/satellite.yaml) was not found, can not continue.
----
In such a case, change directory, for example to the *_root_* user's home directory, and run the command again.
====
+
If the script fails due to missing or outdated packages, you must download and install these separately.
For more information, see the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_satellite/{AccessRedHatComVersion}/html-single/installing_satellite_server_from_a_disconnected_network/installing-satellite-server-disconnected#resolving-package-dependency-errors_satellite[Resolving Package Dependency Errors] section in the _Installing {ProjectServer} from a Disconnected Network_ guide.

. If using a BASH shell, after a successful or failed upgrade, enter:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="attributes"]
----
# hash -d {foreman-maintain} service 2> /dev/null
----

. Check when the kernel packages were last updated:
+
[options="nowrap"]
----
# rpm -qa --last | grep kernel
----

. Optional: If a kernel update occurred since the last reboot, stop the `{foreman-maintain}` services and reboot the system:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} service stop
# reboot
----

. Optional: If you made manual edits to DNS or DHCP configuration files, check and restore any changes required to the DNS and DHCP configuration files using the backups that you made.

. If you make changes in the previous step, restart the `{foreman-maintain}` services.
+
[options="nowrap" subs="attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} service restart
----

. If you have the OpenSCAP plug-in installed, but do not have the default OpenSCAP content available, enter the following command.
+
[options="nowrap" subs="attributes"]
----
# foreman-rake foreman_openscap:bulk_upload:default
----

. In the {Project} web UI, go to *Configure* > *Discovery Rules* and associate selected organizations and locations with discovery rules.

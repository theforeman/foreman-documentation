= Importing Ansible Roles

You can import Ansible roles from the `/etc/ansible/roles` directory on {Project} or on a {SmartProxy} that has Ansible enabled.
Ensure that the roles that you import are located in the `/etc/ansible/roles` directory on all {SmartProxies} from where you want to use the roles.

To import Ansible roles, complete the following steps:

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Configure* > *Roles* and click the {SmartProxy} that contains the roles that you want to import.
. From the list of Ansible roles, select the check box of the roles you want to import, and then click *Update*.

= Configuring a Kickstart Template to Distribute SSH Keys during Provisioning

Kickstart templates that {Project} ships include this snippet by default.
Therefore, {Project} copies the SSH key for remote execution to the systems during provisioning.

.Procedure

* To include the public key in newly-provisioned hosts, add the following snippet to the Kickstart template that you use:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
<%= snippet 'remote_execution_ssh_keys' %>

= Load Balancing Considerations

Distributing load between several {SmartProxyServer}s prevents any one {SmartProxy} from becoming a single point of failure.
Configuring {SmartProxies} to use a load balancer can provide resilience against planned and unplanned outages.
This improves availability and responsiveness.

Consider the following guidelines when configuring load balancing:

* If you use Puppet, Puppet certificate signing is assigned to the first {SmartProxy} that you configure.
If the first {SmartProxy} is down, clients cannot obtain Puppet content.

* This solution does not use Pacemaker or other similar HA tools to maintain one state across all {SmartProxies}.
To troubleshoot issues, reproduce the issue on each {SmartProxy}, bypassing the load balancer.

.Additional Maintenance Required for Load Balancing

Configuring {SmartProxies} to use a load balancer results in a more complex environment and requires additional maintenance.

The following additional steps are required for load balancing:

* You must ensure that all {SmartProxies} have the same Content Views and synchronize all {SmartProxies} to the same Content View versions
* You must upgrade each {SmartProxy} in sequence
* You must backup each {SmartProxy} that you configure regularly

.Upgrading {SmartProxyServer}s in a Load Balancing Configuration

ifdef::satellite[]
To upgrade {SmartProxyServer}s from {ProductVersionPrevious} to {ProductVersion}, complete the {MultiBaseURL}upgrading_and_updating_red_hat_satellite/upgrading_red_hat_satellite#upgrading_capsule_server[Upgrading {SmartProxyServer}s] procedure in _Upgrading and Updating {ProjectName}_.

There are no additional steps required for {SmartProxyServer}s in a load balancing configuration.

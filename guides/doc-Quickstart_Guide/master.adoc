The Foreman installer is a collection of Puppet modules that installs everything required for a full working Foreman setup. It uses native OS packaging (e.g. RPM and .deb packages) and adds necessary configuration for the complete installation.

Components include the Foreman web UI, Smart Proxy, a Puppet server, and optionally Passenger, TFTP, DNS and DHCP servers. It is configurable and the Puppet modules can be read or run in “no-op” mode to see what changes it will make.

The installation will require 4GB of memory, see {InstallingProjectDocURL}system-requirements_{project-context}[System Requirements] for more information.

The Foreman installer uses Puppet (5 or later required) to install Foreman. This guide assumes that you have a newly installed operating system, on which the installer will setup Foreman, a Puppet server, and the Smart Proxy by default. It’s not advisable to follow the steps below on an existing system, since the installer will affect the configuration of several components.

== Running the Installer

The installation run is non-interactive, but the configuration can be customized by supplying any of the options listed in foreman-installer --help, or by running foreman-installer -i for interactive mode. More examples are given in the Installation Options section. Adding -v will disable the progress bar and display all changes.

To run the installer, execute:

ifdef::foreman-el,foreman-deb[]
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# foreman-installer
----
endif::[]
ifdef::katello[]
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# foreman-installer --scenario katello
----
endif::[]

When the installer has completed, details will be printed about where to find Foreman and the Smart Proxy.

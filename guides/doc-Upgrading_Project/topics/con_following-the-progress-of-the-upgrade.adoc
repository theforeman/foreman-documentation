== Following the Progress of the Upgrade

Because of the lengthy upgrade time, use a utility such as `tmux` to suspend and reattach a communication session.
You can then check the upgrade progress without staying connected to the command shell continuously.
For more information, see the `tmux` manual page.

If you lose connection to the command shell where the upgrade command is running you can see the logs in `{installer-log-file}` to check if the process completed successfully.

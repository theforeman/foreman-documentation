== Organizations, locations, and lifecycle environments

{ProjectName} takes a consolidated approach to Organization and Location management.
System administrators define multiple Organizations and multiple Locations in a single {ProjectServer}.
For example, a company might have three Organizations (Finance, Marketing, and Sales) across three countries (United States, United Kingdom, and Japan).
In this example, {ProjectServer} manages all Organizations across all geographical Locations, creating nine distinct contexts for managing systems.
In addition, users can define specific locations and nest them to create a hierarchy.
For example, {Project} administrators might divide the United States into specific cities, such as Boston, Phoenix, or San Francisco.

{ProjectServer} defines all locations and organizations.
Each respective {Project} {SmartProxyServer} synchronizes content and handles configuration of systems in a different location.

The main {ProjectServer} retains the management function, while the content and configuration is synchronized between the main {ProjectServer} and a {Project} {SmartProxyServer} assigned to certain locations.

=== Organizations

Organizations divide {ProjectName} resources into logical groups based on ownership, purpose, content, security level, or other divisions.
You can create and manage multiple organizations through {ProjectName}, then divide and assign your subscriptions to each individual organization.
This provides a method of managing the content of several individual organizations under one management system.

=== Locations

Locations divide organizations into logical groups based on geographical location.
Each location is created and used by a single account, although each account can manage multiple locations and organizations.

=== Lifecycle environments

Application lifecycles are divided into *lifecycle environments* which represent each stage of the application lifecycle.
Lifecycle environments are linked to form an *environment path*.
You can promote content along the environment path to the next lifecycle environment when required.
For example, if development ends on a particular version of an application, you can promote this version to the testing environment and start development on the next version.

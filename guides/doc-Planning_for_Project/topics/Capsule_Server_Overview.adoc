== {SmartProxyServer} Overview

{SmartProxyServers} provide *content federation* and run *localized services* to discover, provision, control, and configure hosts.
You can use {SmartProxies} to extend the {Project} deployment to various geographical locations.
This section contains an overview of features that can be enabled on {SmartProxies} as well as their simple classification.

For more information about {SmartProxy} requirements, installation process, and scalability considerations, see {InstallingSmartProxyDocURL}[Installing {SmartProxyServer}].

[[sect-Documentation-Architecture_Guide-Capsule_Features]]
=== {SmartProxy} Features

There are two sets of features provided by {SmartProxyServers}.
You can use {SmartProxy} to run services required for host management.

You can also configure {SmartProxy} to mirror content from {ProjectServer}.

If you have the Katello plug-in installed, you can also configure {SmartProxy} to mirror content from {ProjectServer}.

Infrastructure and host management services:

* *DHCP* – {SmartProxy} can manage a DHCP server, including integration with an existing solution such as ISC DHCP servers, Active Directory, and Libvirt instances.

* *DNS* – {SmartProxy} can manage a DNS server, including integration with an existing solution such as ISC BIND and Active Directory.

* *TFTP* – {SmartProxy} can integrate with any UNIX-based TFTP server.

* *Realm* – {SmartProxy} can manage Kerberos realms or domains so that hosts can join them automatically during provisioning.
{SmartProxy} can integrate with an existing infrastructure, including {FreeIPA} and Active Directory.

* *Puppet server* – {SmartProxy} can act as a configuration management server by running Puppet server.

* *Puppet Certificate Authority* – {SmartProxy} can integrate with Puppet's CA to provide certificates to hosts.

* *Baseboard Management Controller (BMC)* – {SmartProxy} can provide power management for hosts using IPMI or Redfish.

* *Provisioning template proxy* – {SmartProxy} can serve provisioning templates to hosts.

* *OpenSCAP* – {SmartProxy} can perform security compliance scans on hosts.

* *Remote Execution (REX)* {endash} {SmartProxy} can run remote job execution on hosts.

ifndef::satellite[]
Content related features, provided by the Katello plug-in:
endif::[]

* *Repository synchronization* – the content from {ProjectServer} (more precisely from selected life cycle environments) is pulled to {SmartProxyServer} for content delivery (enabled by Pulp).

* *Content delivery* – hosts configured to use {SmartProxyServer} download content from that {SmartProxy} rather than from the central {ProjectServer} (enabled by Pulp).

* *Host action delivery* – {SmartProxyServer} executes scheduled actions on hosts.

* *Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) proxy* – hosts are registered to their associated {SmartProxyServers} rather than to the central {ProjectServer} or the Red{nbsp}Hat Customer Portal (provided by Candlepin).

[[sect-Documentation-Architecture_Guide-Capsule_Types]]
=== {SmartProxy} Types

Not all {SmartProxy} features have to be enabled at once.
You can configure a {SmartProxyServer} for a specific limited purpose.
Some common configurations include:


* *Infrastructure {SmartProxies}* [DNS + DHCP + TFTP] – provide infrastructure services for hosts.
With provisioning template proxy enabled, infrastructure {SmartProxy} has all necessary services for provisioning new hosts.

* *Content {SmartProxies}* [Pulp] – provide content synchronized from {ProjectServer} to hosts.

* *Configuration {SmartProxies}* [Pulp + Puppet + PuppetCA] – provide content and run configuration services for hosts.

* *All-in-one {SmartProxies}* [DNS + DHCP + TFTP + Pulp + Puppet + PuppetCA] – provide a full set of {SmartProxy} features.
All-in-one {SmartProxies} enable host isolation by providing a single point of connection for managed hosts.

[[sect-Documentation-Architecture_Guide-Capsule_Networking]]
=== {SmartProxy} Networking

The goal of {SmartProxy} isolation is to provide a single endpoint for all of the host's network communications so that in remote network segments, you need only open firewall ports to the {SmartProxy} itself.
The following diagram shows how the {Project} components interact in the scenario with hosts connecting to an isolated {SmartProxy}.

The following diagram shows how the {Project} components interact when hosts connect directly to {ProjectServer}.
Note that as the base system of an external {SmartProxy} is a Client of the {Project}, this diagram is relevant even if you do not intend to have directly connected hosts.

== Technical Users Provided and Required by {Project}

During the installation of {Project}, system accounts are created.
They are used to manage files and process ownership of the components integrated into {Project}.
Some of these accounts have fixed UIDs and GIDs, while others take the next available UID and GID on the system instead.
To control the UIDs and GIDs assigned to accounts, you can define accounts before installing {Project}.
Because some of the accounts have hard-coded UIDs and GIDs, it is not possible to do this with all accounts created during {Project} installation.

The following table lists all the accounts created by {Project} during installation.
You can predefine accounts that have *Yes* in the *Flexible UID and GID* column with custom UID and GID before installing {Project}.

Do not change the home and shell directories of system accounts because they are requirements for {Project} to work correctly.

Because of potential conflicts with local users that {Project} creates, you cannot use external identity providers for the system users of the {Project} base operating system.

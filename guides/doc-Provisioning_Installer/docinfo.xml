    This guide provides information on how to configure Satellite for installer-based provisioning and how to use network boot and boot disks to provision both bare metal and virtual machines.
    Designed for Satellite users who have control over network services, such as DNS, DHCP, and TFTP, this guide helps you configure networking for network boot provisioning, including discovery of hosts on your provisioning network.
    Certain boot disks can also overcome limitations for users who cannot control network services and still want to provision hosts by using installer automation.
    The guide covers both configuration of Satellite and creation of new hosts, either manually or by using the Discovery service.
    By the end of this guide, you will have a host fully provisioned by using the Anaconda installer with Kickstart automation.

== Configuring the Discovery Service

{ProjectName} can detect hosts on a network that are not in your {Project} inventory.
These hosts boot the discovery image that performs hardware detection and relays this information back to {ProjectServer}.
This method creates a list of ready-to-provision hosts in {ProjectServer} without needing to enter the MAC address of each host.

When you boot a blank bare-metal host, the boot menu has two options: `local` and `discovery`.
If you select `discovery` to boot the Discovery image, after a few minutes, the Discovery image completes booting and a status screen is displayed.

The Discovery service is enabled by default on {ProjectServer}.
However, the default setting of the global templates is to boot from the local hard drive.
To change the default setting, in the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Administer* > *Settings*, and click the *Provisioning* tab.
Locate the *Default PXE global template entry* row, and in the *Value* column, enter *discovery*.

To use {ProjectServer} to provide the Discovery image, install the following RPM packages:

* `tfm-rubygem-foreman_discovery`
ifdef::satellite[]
* `foreman-discovery-image`
endif::[]
* `tfm-rubygem-smart_proxy_discovery`

The `tfm-rubygem-foreman_discovery` package contains the {Project} plug-in to handle discovered nodes, connections, and necessary database structures, and API.

ifdef::satellite[]
The `foreman-discovery-image` package installs the Discovery ISO to the `/usr/share/foreman-discovery-image/` directory.
You can build a PXE boot image from this ISO using the `livecd-iso-to-pxeboot` tool.
The tool saves this PXE boot image in the `/var/lib/tftpboot/boot` directory.
For more information, see xref:building-a-discovery-image[].
endif::[]

The `tfm-rubygem-smart_proxy_discovery` package configures {SmartProxyServer}, such as the integrated {SmartProxy} of {ProjectServer}, to act as a proxy for the Discovery service.

ifdef::foreman-el,katello[]
You can use the `{foreman-installer}` tool to install the packages and the Discovery image.

ifdef::orcharhino[]
Refer to the xref:sources/usage_guides/host_discovery_guide.adoc#host_discovery_guide_installation[installation] section of the host discovery guide on how to install this plugin on your orcharhino.
endif::[]

When the installation completes, you can view the new menu option by navigating to *Hosts* > *Discovered Hosts*.

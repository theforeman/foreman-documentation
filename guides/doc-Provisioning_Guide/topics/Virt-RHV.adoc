. In the *Memory* field, enter the amount of memory to allocate to the new host.
. From the *Image* list, select image to use for image-based provisioning.
. In the *Network Interfaces* area, enter the network parameters for the host's network interface. You can create multiple network interfaces. However, at least one interface must point to a {SmartProxy}-managed network. For each network interface, enter the following details:
.. In the *Name* field, enter the name of the network interface.
.. From the *Network* list, select The logical network that you want to use.
. In the *Storage* area, enter the storage parameters for the host. You can create multiple volumes for the host. For each volume, enter the following details:
.. In the *Size (GB)* enter the size, in GB, for the new volume.
.. From the *Storage domain* list, select the storage domain for the volume.
.. From the *Preallocate disk*, select either thin provisioning or preallocation of the full disk.
.. From the *Bootable* list, select whether you want a bootable or non bootable volume.
. Click *Submit* to save the compute profile.

.For CLI Users

The compute profile CLI commands are not yet implemented in {ProjectName} {ProductVersion}. As an alternative, you can include the same settings directly during the host creation process.

[[Provisioning_Virtual_Machines_in_Red_Hat_Virtualization-Creating_Hosts_on_a_Red_Hat_Virtualization_Server]]
=== Creating Network-Based Hosts on a {OVirt} Server

In {Project}, you can create {OVirt} hosts over a network connection or from an existing image.

To create a host over a network, the new host must have access to either {ProjectServer}'s integrated {SmartProxy} or an external {SmartProxyServer} on a {OVirt} virtual network, so that the host has access to PXE provisioning services. The new host entry triggers the {OVirt} server to create the virtual machine. If the virtual machine detects the defined {SmartProxyServer} through the virtual network, the virtual machine boots to PXE and begins to install the chosen operating system.

.DHCP conflicts
If you use a virtual network on the {OVirt} server for provisioning, ensure to select one that does not provide DHCP assignments. This causes DHCP conflicts with {ProjectServer} when booting new hosts.

When you create a host with an existing image, the new host entry triggers the {OVirt} server to create the virtual machine, using the pre-existing image as a basis for the new volume.

.Procedure

To create a host for {OVirt} Server, complete the following steps:

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Hosts* > *New Host*.
. In the *Name* field, enter the name that you want to become the provisioned system's host name.
. Click the *Organization* and *Location* tabs to ensure that the provisioning context is automatically set to the current context.
. From the *Host Group* list, select the host group that you want to use to populate the form.
. From the *Deploy on* list, select the {OVirt} connection.
. From the *Compute Profile* list, select a profile to use to automatically populate virtual machine-based settings.
. Click the *Interface* tab and click *Edit* on the host's interface.
. Verify that the fields are automatically populated with values. Note in particular:
+
  * The *Name* from the *Host* tab becomes the *DNS name*.
  * {ProjectServer} automatically assigns an IP address for the new host.
+
. Ensure that the *MAC address* field is blank. The {OVirt} server assigns one to the host.
. Verify that the *Managed*, *Primary*, and *Provision* options are automatically selected for the first interface on the host. If not, select them.
. In the interface window, ensure that the {OVirt}-specific fields are populated with settings from the compute profile. Modify these settings to suit your needs.
. Click the *Operating System* tab, and confirm that all fields automatically contain values.
. For network-based provisioning, ensure that the *Provisioning Method* is set to `Network Based`. For image-based provisioning, ensure that the *Provisioning Method* is set to `Image Based`.
. Click *Resolve* in *Provisioning templates* to check the new host can identify the right provisioning templates to use.
. Click the *Virtual Machine* tab and confirm that these settings are populated with details from the host group and compute profile. Modify these settings to suit your needs.
. Click the *Parameters* tab and ensure that a parameter exists that provides an activation key. If not, add an activation key.
. Click *Submit* to save the host entry.

.For CLI Users

To create a host with network-based provisioning, use the `hammer host create` command and include `--provision-method build`.

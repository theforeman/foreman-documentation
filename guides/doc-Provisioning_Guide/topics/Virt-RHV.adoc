== Provisioning Virtual Machines in Red Hat Virtualization

Red Hat Virtualization (version 4.0 and later) or Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization (version 3.6 and earlier) is an enterprise-grade server and desktop virtualization platform built on Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

With {ProjectNameX}, you can manage virtualization functions through Red Hat Virtualization's REST API version 3. REST API version 4 is not yet supported by {ProjectX}. This includes creating virtual machines and controlling their power states.

Use the following procedures to add a connection to a Red Hat Virtualization environment and provision a virtual machine.

[[Provisioning_Virtual_Machines_in_Red_Hat_Enterprise_Virtualization-Prerequisites_for_Red_Hat_Virtualization_Provisioning]]
=== Prerequisites for Red Hat Virtualization Provisioning

The requirements for Red Hat Virtualization provisioning include:

  * Synchronized content repositories for the version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux that you want to use. For more information, see link:/html/content_management_guide/importing_red_hat_content#Importing_Red_Hat_Content-Synchronizing_Red_Hat_Repositories[Synchronizing Red Hat Repositories] in the _Content Management Guide_.
  * A {SmartProxyServer} managing a logical network on the Red Hat Virtualization environment. Ensure no other DHCP services run on this network to avoid conflicts with the {SmartProxyServer}. For more information, see xref:Configuring_Networking[].
  * An existing template, other than the `blank` template, if you want to use image-based provisioning. For more information about creating templates for virtual machines, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_virtualization/4.0/html/virtual_machine_management_guide/chap-templates[Templates] in the _Virtual Machine Management Guide_.
  * An activation key for host registration. For more information, see link:/html/content_management_guide/managing_activation_keys#Managing_Activation_Keys-Creating_an_Activation_Key[Creating An Activation Key] in the _Content Management_ guide.

[[Provisioning_Virtual_Machines_in_Red_Hat_Virtualization-Creating_a_Red_Hat_Virtualization_User]]
=== Creating a Red Hat Virtualization User

The Red Hat Virtualization server requires an administration-like user for {ProjectServer} communication. For security reasons, Red Hat advises against using the `admin@internal` user for such communication. Instead, create a new Red Hat Virtualization user with the following permissions:

  - System
    * Configure System
      ** Login Permissions
  - Network
    * Configure vNIC Profile
      ** Create
      ** Edit Properties
      ** Delete
      ** Assign vNIC Profile to VM
      ** Assign vNIC Profile to Template
  - Template
    * Provisioning Operations
      ** Import/Export
  - VM
    * Provisioning Operations
      ** Create
      ** Delete
      ** Import/Export
      ** Edit Storage
  - Disk
    * Provisioning Operations
      ** Create
    * Disk Profile
      ** Attach Disk Profile

For more information about how to create a user and add permissions in Red Hat Virtualization, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_virtualization/4.1/html/administration_guide/sect-red_hat_enterprise_virtualization_manager_user_tasks[Administering User Tasks From the Administration Portal] in the _Red Hat Virtualization Administration Guide_.

. In the *Network Interfaces* area, enter the network parameters for the host's network interface. You can create multiple network interfaces. However, at least one interface must point to a {SmartProxy}-managed network. For each network interface, enter the following details:
.. In the *Name* field, enter the name of the network interface.
.. From the *Network* list, select The logical network that you want to use.
. In the *Storage* area, enter the storage parameters for the host. You can create multiple volumes for the host. For each volume, enter the following details:
.. In the *Size (GB)* enter the size, in GB, for the new volume.
.. From the *Storage domain* list, select the storage domain for the volume.
.. From the *Preallocate disk*, select either thin provisioning or preallocation of the full disk.
.. From the *Bootable* list, select whether you want a bootable or non bootable volume.
. Click *Submit* to save the compute profile.

.For CLI Users

The compute profile CLI commands are not yet implemented in {ProjectName} {ProductVersion}. As an alternative, you can include the same settings directly during the host creation process.

[[Provisioning_Virtual_Machines_in_Red_Hat_Virtualization-Creating_Hosts_on_a_Red_Hat_Virtualization_Server]]
=== Creating Network-Based Hosts on a Red Hat Virtualization Server

In {Project}, you can create Red Hat Virtualization hosts over a network connection or from an existing image.

To create a host over a network, the new host must have access to either {ProjectServer}'s integrated {SmartProxy} or an external {SmartProxyServer} on a Red Hat Virtualization virtual network, so that the host has access to PXE provisioning services. The new host entry triggers the Red Hat Virtualization server to create the virtual machine. If the virtual machine detects the defined {SmartProxyServer} through the virtual network, the virtual machine boots to PXE and begins to install the chosen operating system.

.DHCP conflicts
If you use a virtual network on the Red Hat Virtualization server for provisioning, ensure to select one that does not provide DHCP assignments. This causes DHCP conflicts with {ProjectServer} when booting new hosts.

When you create a host with an existing image, the new host entry triggers the Red Hat Virtualization server to create the virtual machine, using the pre-existing image as a basis for the new volume.

.Procedure

To create a host for Red Hat Virtualization Server, complete the following steps:

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Hosts* > *New Host*.
. In the *Name* field, enter the name that you want to become the provisioned system's host name.
. Click the *Organization* and *Location* tabs to ensure that the provisioning context is automatically set to the current context.
. From the *Host Group* list, select the host group that you want to use to populate the form.
. From the *Deploy on* list, select the Red Hat Virtualization connection.
. From the *Compute Profile* list, select a profile to use to automatically populate virtual machine-based settings.
. Click the *Interface* tab and click *Edit* on the host's interface.
. Verify that the fields are automatically populated with values. Note in particular:
+
  * The *Name* from the *Host* tab becomes the *DNS name*.
  * {ProjectServer} automatically assigns an IP address for the new host.
+
. Ensure that the *MAC address* field is blank. The Red Hat Virtualization server assigns one to the host.
. Verify that the *Managed*, *Primary*, and *Provision* options are automatically selected for the first interface on the host. If not, select them.
. In the interface window, ensure that the Red Hat Virtualization-specific fields are populated with settings from the compute profile. Modify these settings to suit your needs.
. Click the *Operating System* tab, and confirm that all fields automatically contain values.
. For network-based provisioning, ensure that the *Provisioning Method* is set to `Network Based`. For image-based provisioning, ensure that the *Provisioning Method* is set to `Image Based`.
. Click *Resolve* in *Provisioning templates* to check the new host can identify the right provisioning templates to use.
. Click the *Virtual Machine* tab and confirm that these settings are populated with details from the host group and compute profile. Modify these settings to suit your needs.
. Click the *Parameters* tab and ensure that a parameter exists that provides an activation key. If not, add an activation key.
. Click *Submit* to save the host entry.

.For CLI Users

To create a host with network-based provisioning, use the `hammer host create` command and include `--provision-method build`.

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]

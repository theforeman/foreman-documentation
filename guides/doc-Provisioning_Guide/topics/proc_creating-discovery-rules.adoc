= Creating Discovery Rules

As a method of automating the provisioning process for discovered hosts, {Project} provides a feature to create discovery rules.
These rules define how discovered hosts automatically provision themselves, based on the assigned host group.
For example, you can automatically provision hosts with a high CPU count as hypervisors.
Likewise, you can provision hosts with large hard disks as storage servers.

To use the CLI instead of the web UI, see the xref:cli-creating-discovery-rules_{context}[].

.NIC Considerations
Auto provisioning does not currently allow configuring NICs; all systems are being provisioned with the NIC configuration that was detected during discovery.
However, you can set the NIC in the `{provision-script}` scriplet, using a script, or using configuration management at a later stage.

.Procedure

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Configure* > *Discovery rules*, and select *Create Rule*.
. In the *Name* field, enter a name for the rule.
. In the *Search* field, enter the rules to determine whether to provision a host.
This field provides suggestions for values you enter and allows operators for multiple rules.
For example: `cpu_count  > 8`.
. From the *Host Group* list, select the host group to use as a template for this host.
. In the *Hostname* field, enter the pattern to determine host names for multiple hosts.
This uses the same ERB syntax that provisioning templates use.
The host name can use the `@host` attribute for host-specific values and the `rand` function for a random number.
For more information about provisioning templates, see xref:provisioning-templates_provisioning[].
+
* `myhost-<%= rand(99999) %>`
* `abc-<%= @host.facts['bios_vendor'] %>-<%= rand(99999) %>`
* `xyz-<%= @host.hostgroup.name %>`
* `srv-<%= @host.discovery_rule.name %>`
* `server-<%= @host.ip.gsub('.','-') +  '-' + @host.hostgroup.subnet.name %>`
+
When creating host name patterns, ensure that the resulting host names are unique, do not start with numbers, and do not contain underscores or dots.
A good approach is to use unique information provided by Facter, such as the MAC address, BIOS, or serial ID.
+
. In the *Hosts limit* field, enter the maximum number of hosts that you can provision with the rule.
Enter `0` for unlimited.
. In the *Priority* field, enter a number to set the precedence the rule has over other rules.
Rules with lower values have a higher priority.
. From the *Enabled* list, select whether you want to enable the rule.
. To set a different provisioning context for the rule, click the *Organizations* and *Locations* tabs and select the contexts you want to use.
. Click *Submit* to save your rule.
. Navigate to *Hosts* > *Discovered Host* and select one of the following two options:
+
* From the *Discovered hosts* list on the right, select *Auto-Provision* to automatically provisions a single host.
* On the upper right of the window, click *Auto-Provision All* to automatically provisions all hosts.

.CLI procedure

. Create the rule with the `hammer discovery-rule create` command:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer discovery-rule create --name "Hypervisor" \
--search "cpu_count  > 8" --hostgroup "_My_Host_Group_" \
--hostname "hypervisor-<%= rand(99999) %>" \
--hosts-limit 5 --priority 5 --enabled true
----

. Automatically provision a host with the `hammer discovery auto-provision` command:
+
----
# hammer discovery auto-provision --name "macabcdef123456"
----

== Configuring Provisioning Contexts

Before you provision hosts using {Project}, you must understand the placement strategy for hosts in {Project}. This is known as the provisioning context.

[[Configuring_Provisioning_Contexts-Defining_a_Provisioning_Context]]
=== Provisioning Context Overview

A provisioning context is the combination of an organization and location that you specify for {Project} components. The organization and location that a component belongs to sets the ownership and access for that component.

Organizations divide {ProjectNameX} components into logical groups based on ownership, purpose, content, security level, and other divisions. You can create and manage multiple organizations through {ProjectNameX} and assign components to each individual organization. This ensures the {ProjectServer} provisions hosts within a certain organization and only uses components that are assigned to that organization. For more information about organizations, see {BaseURL}content_management_guide/managing_organizations[Managing Organizations] in the _Content Management Guide_.

Locations function similar to organizations. The difference is that locations are based on physical or geographical setting. Users can nest locations in a hierarchy.

For more information about locations, see {BaseURL}content_management_guide/managing_locations[Managing Locations] in the _Content Management Guide_.


[[Configuring_Provisioning_Contexts-Setting_the_Provisioning_Context]]
=== Setting the Provisioning Context

When you set a context, you define which organization and location to use for provisioning hosts.

The organization and location menus are located in the menu bar, on the upper left of the {Project} web UI. If you have not selected an organization and location to use, the menu displays: *Any Organization* and *Any Location*.

.Procedure

* To set the provisioning context, click the *Any Organization* and *Any Location* buttons and select the organization and location to use.


Each user can set their default provisioning context in their account settings. Click the user name in the upper right of the {Project} web UI and select *My account* to edit your user account settings.

.For CLI Users

While using the CLI, include either `--organization` or `--organization-label` and `--location` or `--location-id` as an option. For example:

[subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer host list --organization "Default_Organization" --location "Default_Location"
----

This command outputs hosts allocated for the Default_Organization and Default_Location.

== Introduction

Provisioning is a process that starts with a bare physical or virtual machine and ends with a fully configured, ready-to-use operating system. Using {ProjectName}, you can define and automate fine-grained provisioning for a large number of hosts.

There are many provisioning methods. For example, you can use {ProjectServer}'s integrated {SmartProxy} or an external {SmartProxyServer} to provision bare metal hosts using both PXE based and non-PXE based methods. You can also provision cloud instances from specific providers through their APIs. These provisioning methods are part of the {ProjectNameX} application life cycle to create, manage, and update hosts.

=== Provisioning Types Overview

{ProjectNameX} has different methods for provisioning hosts:

Bare Metal Provisioning::
  {Project} provisions bare metal hosts primarily through PXE boot and MAC address identification. You can create host entries and specify the MAC address of the physical host to provision. You can also boot blank hosts to use {Project}'s discovery service, which creates a pool of ready-to-provision hosts. You can also boot and provision hosts through PXE-less methods.

Cloud Providers::
  {Project} connects to private and public cloud providers to provision instances of hosts from images that are stored with the Cloud environment. This also includes selecting which hardware profile or flavor to use.

Virtualization Infrastructure::
  {Project} connects to virtualization infrastructure services such as {OVirt} and VMware to provision virtual machines from virtual image templates or using the same PXE-based boot methods as bare metal providers.

[[Introduction-Defining_the_Provisioning_Workflow]]
=== Provisioning Workflow Overview

The provisioning process follows a basic PXE workflow:

. You create a host and select a domain and subnet. {Project} requests an available IP address from the DHCP {SmartProxyServer} that is associated with the subnet or from a database. {Project} loads this IP address into the *IP address* field in the Create Host window. When you complete all the options for the new host, submit the new host request.
. Depending on the configuration specifications of the host, the its domain and subnet, {Project} configures the following settings:
* A DHCP record is created on the {SmartProxyServer} that is associated with the subnet.
* A forward DNS record is created on the {SmartProxyServer} that is associated with the domain.
* A reverse DNS record is created on the DNS {SmartProxyServer} that is associated with the subnet.
* PXELinux, Grub, Grub2, and iPXE configuration files are created for the host in the TFTP {SmartProxyServer} that is associated with the subnet.
* A Puppet certificate is generated on the associated Puppet server.
* A realm is created on the associated identity server.
. The new host requests a DHCP reservation from the DHCP server.
. The DHCP server responds to the reservation request and returns TFTP `next-server` and `filename` options.
. The host requests the boot loader and menu from the TFTP server according to the PXELoader setting.
. A boot loader is returned over TFTP.
. The boot loader fetches configuration for the host through its provision interface MAC address.
. The boot loader fetches the operating system installer kernel, init RAM disk, and boot parameters.
. The installer requests the provisioning template from {Project}.
. {Project} renders the provision template and returns the result to the host.
. The installer performs installation of the operating system.
ifeval::["{build}" == "foreman"]
* When Katello plugin is installed, the installer registers the host to {Project} using Red Hat Subscription Manager.
* When Katello plugin is installed, management tools such as `katello-agent` and `puppet` are installed.
endif::[]
ifeval::["{build}" == "satellite"]
* The installer registers the host to {Project} using Red Hat Subscription Manager.
* The installer installs management tools such as `katello-agent` and `puppet`.
endif::[]
* The installer notifies {Project} of a successful build in the `postinstall` script.
. The PXE configuration files revert to a local boot template.
. The host reboots.
. The new host requests a DHCP reservation from the DHCP server.
. The DHCP server responds to the reservation request and returns TFTP `next-server` and `filename` options.
. The host requests the bootloader and menu from the TFTP server according to the PXELoader setting.
. A boot loader is returned over TFTP.
. The boot loader fetches the configuration for the host through its provision interface MAC address.
. The boot loader initiates boot from the local drive.
. If you configured the host to use any Puppet classes, the host configures itself using the modules.

This workflow differs depending on custom options. For example:

*Discovery*

If you use the Discovery service, {Project} automatically detects the MAC address of the new host and restarts the host after you submit a request. Note that TCP port 8443 must be reachable by the {SmartProxy} to which the host is attached for {Project} to restart the host.

*PXE-less Provisioning*

After you submit a new host request, you must boot the specific host with a boot disk that you download from {Project} and transfer and attach to a USB port of the host.

*Compute Resources*

The {Project} creates the virtual machine for the host and returns the MAC address to {Project}. If you use image-based provisioning, the host does not follow the standard PXE boot and operating system installation: the compute resource creates a copy of the image for the new host to use. Depending on image settings in {Project}, seed data can be passed in for initial configuration (e.g. via cloud-init) or {Project} can perform SSH connection to the server and execute a template to finish off customization.

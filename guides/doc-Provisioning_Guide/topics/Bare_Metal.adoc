[[Provisioning_Bare_Metal_Hosts]]
== Provisioning Bare Metal Hosts

There are four main ways to provision bare metal instances with {ProjectName} {ProductVersion}:

Unattended Provisioning::
New hosts are identified by a MAC address and {ProjectServer} provisions the host using a PXE boot process.

Unattended Provisioning with Discovery::
New hosts use PXE boot to load the {Project} Discovery service. This service identifies hardware information about the host and lists it as an available host to provision. For more information, see xref:configuring-the-discovery-service[].

PXE-less Provisioning::
New hosts are provisioned with a boot disk or PXE-less discovery image that {ProjectServer} generates.

PXE-less Provisioning with Discovery::
New hosts use an ISO boot disk that loads the {Project} Discovery service. This service identifies hardware information about the host and lists it as an available host to provision. For more information, see xref:implementing-pxe-less-discovery[].

ifeval::["{build}" != "satellite"]
NOTE: Discovery workflows are only available when the Discovery plug-in is installed. For more information, see xref:configuring-the-discovery-service[].
endif::[]

.BIOS and UEFI Support

With {ProjectName}, you can perform both BIOS and UEFI based PXE provisioning.

Both BIOS and UEFI interfaces work as interpreters between the computer's operating system and firmware, initializing the hardware components and starting the operating system at boot time.

ifeval::["{build}" == "satellite"]
For information about supported workflows, see https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2674001[Supported architectures and provisioning scenarios].
endif::[]

In {Project} provisioning, the PXE loader option defines the DHCP `filename` option to use during provisioning. For BIOS systems, use the *PXELinux BIOS* option to enable a provisioned node to download the `pxelinux.0` file over TFTP. For UEFI systems, use the *PXEGrub2 UEFI* option to enable a TFTP client to download `grub2/grubx64.efi` file.

For BIOS provisioning, you must associate a PXELinux template with the operating system.

For UEFI provisioning, you must associate a PXEGrub2 template with the operating system.

If you associate both PXELinux and PXEGrub2 templates, {ProjectX} can deploy configuration files for both on a TFTP server, so that you can switch between PXE loaders easily.

[[Provisioning_Bare_Metal_Hosts-Prerequisites_for_Bare_Metal_Provisioning]]
=== Prerequisites for Bare Metal Provisioning

The requirements for bare metal provisioning include:

* A {SmartProxyServer} managing the network for bare metal hosts. For unattended provisioning and discovery-based provisioning, {ProjectServer} requires PXE server settings.
+
For more information about networking requirements, see xref:Configuring_Networking[].
+
For more information about the Discovery service, xref:configuring-the-discovery-service[].
+
* A bare metal host or a blank VM.

For information about the security token for unattended and PXE-less provisioning, see xref:Provisioning_Bare_Metal_Hosts-Security_Token_in_the_Boot_Process[].

[[Provisioning_Bare_Metal_Hosts-Security_Token_in_the_Boot_Process]]
=== Configuring the Security Token Validity Duration

When performing unattended and PXE-less provisioning, as a security measure, {Project} automatically generates a unique token and adds this token to the {provision-script} URL in the PXE configuration file (PXELinux, Grub2).

By default, the token is valid for 360 minutes. When you provision a host, ensure that you reboot the host within this time frame. If the token expires, it is no longer valid and you receive a 404 error and the operating system installer download fails.

To adjust the token's duration of validity, in the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Administer* > *Settings*, and click the *Provisioning* tab. Find the *Token duration* option, and click the edit icon and edit the duration, or enter `0` to disable token generation.

If token generation is disabled, an attacker can spoof client IP address and download {provision-script} from {ProjectServer}, including the encrypted root password.

[[Provisioning_Bare_Metal_Hosts-Creating_New_Hosts_with_Unattended_Provisioning]]
=== Creating Hosts with Unattended Provisioning

Unattended provisioning is the simplest form of host provisioning. You enter the host details on {ProjectServer} and boot your host. {ProjectServer} automatically manages the PXE configuration, organizes networking services, and provides the operating system and configuration for the host.

This method of provisioning hosts uses minimal interaction during the process.

.Procedure

To create a host with unattended provisioning, complete the following steps:

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Hosts* > *Create Host*.
. In the *Name* field, enter a name for the host.
. Click the *Organization* and *Location* tabs and change the context to match your requirements.
. From the *Host Group* list, select a host group that you want to use to populate the form.
. Click the *Interface* tab, and on the host's interface, click *Edit*.
. Verify that the fields are populated with values. Note in particular:
+
* The *Name* from the *Host* tab becomes the *DNS name*.
* {ProjectServer} automatically assigns an IP address for the new host.
+
. In the *MAC address* field, enter a MAC address for the host. This ensures the identification of the host during the PXE boot process.
. Ensure that {ProjectServer} automatically selects the *Managed*, *Primary*, and *Provision* options for the first interface on the host. If not, select them.
. In the *MAC address* field, enter a MAC address of the host's provisioning interface. This ensures the identification of the host during the PXE boot process.
. Click *OK* to save. To add another interface, click *Add Interface*. You can select only one interface for *Provision* and *Primary*.
. Click the *Operating System* tab, and verify that all fields contain values. Confirm each aspect of the operating system.
. Optional: Click *Resolve* in *Provisioning template* to check the new host can identify the right provisioning templates to use.
+
For more information about associating provisioning templates, see xref:provisioning-templates_provisioning[].
ifeval::["{build}" == "satellite"]
. Click the *Parameters* tab, and ensure that a parameter exists that provides an activation key. If not, add an activation key.
endif::[]
ifeval::["{build}" == "foreman"]
. If you use the Katello plugin, click the *Parameters* tab, and ensure that a parameter exists that provides an activation key. If not, add an activation key.
endif::[]
. Click *Submit* to save the host details.
+
For more information about network interfaces, see {BaseURL}/managing_hosts/index#Adding_Network_Interfaces[Adding network interfaces].

This creates the host entry and the relevant provisioning settings. This also includes creating the necessary directories and files for PXE booting the bare metal host. If you start the physical host and set its boot mode to PXE, the host detects the DHCP service of {ProjectServer}'s integrated {SmartProxy} and starts installing the operating system from its Kickstart tree.

ifeval::["{build}" == "satellite"]
When the installation completes, the host also registers to {ProjectServer} using the activation key and installs the necessary configuration and management tools from the {project-client-name} repository.
endif::[]

ifeval::["{build}" == "foreman"]
If you use the Katello plug-in, when the installation completes, the host also registers to {ProjectServer} using the activation key and installs the necessary configuration and management tools from the {project-client-name} repository.
endif::[]

.For CLI Users

Create the host with the `hammer host create` command.

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer host create --name "_My_Unattended_Host_" --organization "_My_Organization_" \
--location "_My_Location_" --hostgroup "_My_Host_Group_" --mac "_aa:aa:aa:aa:aa:aa_" \
--build true --enabled true --managed true
----

Ensure the network interface options are set using the `hammer host interface update` command.
----
# hammer host interface update --host "test1" --managed true \
--primary true --provision true

[[Provisioning_Bare_Metal_Hosts-Creating_New_Hosts_with_PXE-less_Provisioning]]
=== Creating Hosts with PXE-less Provisioning

Some hardware does not provide a PXE boot interface. In {Project}, you can provision a host without PXE boot. This is also known as PXE-less provisioning and involves generating a boot ISO that hosts can use. Using this ISO, the host can connect to {ProjectServer}, boot the installation media, and install the operating system.

{Project} also provides a PXE-less discovery service that operates without PXE-based services, such as DHCP and TFTP. For more information, see xref:implementing-pxe-less-discovery[].

.Boot ISO Types

There are four types of boot ISOs:

Host image::
A boot ISO for the specific host. This image contains only the boot files that are necessary to access the installation media on {ProjectServer}. The user defines the subnet data in {Project} and the image is created with static networking.

Full host image::
A boot ISO that contains the kernel and initial RAM disk image for the specific host. This image is useful if the host fails to chainload correctly. The provisioning template still downloads from {ProjectServer}.

Generic image::
A boot ISO that is not associated with a specific host. The ISO sends the host's MAC address to {ProjectServer}, which matches it against the host entry. The image does not store IP address details, and requires access to a DHCP server on the network to bootstrap. This image is also available from the `/bootdisk/disks/generic` URL on your {ProjectServer}, for example, `https://{foreman-example-com}/bootdisk/disks/generic`.

Subnet image::
A boot ISO that is similar to the generic image but is configured with the address of a {SmartProxyServer}. This image is generic to all hosts with a provisioning NIC on the same subnet.

*Host image* and *Full host image* contain provisioning tokens, therefore the generated image has limited lifespan. For more information about configuring security tokens, read xref:Provisioning_Bare_Metal_Hosts-Security_Token_in_the_Boot_Process[].

[NOTE]
ifeval::["{build}" == "satellite"]
The *Full host image* is based on SYSLINUX and works with all {RHEL} certified hardware.
endif::[]
ifeval::["{build}" != "satellite"]
The *Full host image* is based on SYSLINUX and works with most hardware.
endif::[]
When using a *Host image*, *Generic image*, or *Subnet image*, see http://ipxe.org/appnote/hardware_drivers for a list of hardware drivers expected to work with an iPXE-based boot disk.

.Procedure

To create a host with PXE-less provisioning, complete the following steps:

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Hosts* > *Create Host*.
. In the *Name* field, enter a name that you want to become the provisioned system's host name.
. Click the *Organization* and *Location* tabs and change the context to match your requirements.
. From the *Host Group* list, select a host group that you want to use to populate the form.
. Click the *Interface* tab, and on the host's interface, click *Edit*.
. Verify that the fields are populated with values. Note in particular:
+
* The *Name* from the *Host* tab becomes the *DNS name*.
* {ProjectServer} automatically assigns an IP address for the new host.
+
. In the *MAC address* field, enter a MAC address for the host.
. Ensure that {ProjectServer} automatically selects the *Managed*, *Primary*, and *Provision* options for the first interface on the host. If not, select them.
. Click the *Operating System* tab, and verify that all fields contain values. Confirm each aspect of the operating system.
. Click *Resolve* in *Provisioning template* to check the new host can identify the right provisioning templates to use.
+
For more information about associating provisioning templates, see xref:provisioning-templates_provisioning[].
+
ifeval::["{build}" == "satellite"]
. If you use the Katello plug-in, click the *Parameters* tab, and ensure that a parameter exists that provides an activation key. If not, add an activation key.
endif::[]
ifeval::["{build}" == "satellite"]
. Click the *Parameters* tab, and ensure that a parameter exists that provides an activation key. If not, add an activation key.
endif::[]
. Click *Submit* to save the host details.

This creates a host entry and the host details page appears.

The options on the upper-right of the window are the *Boot disk* menu. From this menu, one of the following images is available for download: *Host image*, *Full host image*, *Generic image*, and *Subnet image*.

.For CLI Users

Create the host with the `hammer host create` command.

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer host create --name "_My_Bare_Metal_" --organization "_My_Organization_" \
--location "_My_Location_" --hostgroup "_My_Host_Group_" --mac "aa:aa:aa:aa:aa:aa" \
--build true --enabled true --managed true
----

Ensure that your network interface options are set using the `hammer host interface update` command.

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer host interface update --host "test3" --managed true \
--primary true --provision true
----

Download the boot disk from {ProjectServer} with the `hammer bootdisk host` command:

* For *Host image*:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer bootdisk host --host _test3.example.com_
----

* For *Full host image*:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer bootdisk host --host _test3.example.com_ --full true
----

* For *Generic image*:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer bootdisk generic
----

* For *Subnet image*:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer bootdisk subnet --subnet _subnetName_
----

This creates a boot ISO for your host to use.

Write the ISO to a USB storage device using the *dd* utility or *livecd-tools* if required.

When you start the physical host and boot from the ISO or the USB storage device, the host connects to {ProjectServer} and starts installing operating system from its kickstart tree.

ifeval::["{build}" == "satellite"]
When the installation completes, the host also registers to {ProjectServer} using the activation key and installs the necessary configuration and management tools from the *{project-client-name}* repository.

[[Configuring_Provisioning_Resources-Creating_Provisioning_Templates-Deploying_SSH_Keys_during_Provisioning]]
=== Deploying SSH Keys during Provisioning

Use this procedure to deploy SSH keys added to a user during provisioning. For information on adding SSH keys to a user, see {BaseURL}administering_red_hat_satellite/chap-red_hat_satellite-administering_red_hat_satellite-users_and_roles#sect-{Project_Link}-Administering_{Project_Link}-Creating_and_Managing_Users-Adding_SSH_keys_to_a_User[Adding SSH Keys to a User] in _Administering {ProjectName}_.

.Procedure

To deploy SSH keys during provisioning, complete the following steps:

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Hosts* > *Provisioning Templates*.
. Create a provisioning template, or clone and edit an existing template. For more information, see xref:creating-provisioning-templates_provisioning[].
. In the template, click the *Template* tab.
. In the *Template editor* field, add the `create_users` snippet to the `%post` section:
+
----
<%= snippet('create_users') %>
----
+
. Select the *Default* check box.
. Click the *Association* tab.
. From the *Application Operating Systems* list, select an operating system.
. Click *Submit* to save the provisioning template.
. Create a host that is associated with the provisioning template or rebuild a host using the OS associated with the modified template. For more information, see {BaseURL}/managing_hosts/#sect-{Project_Link}-Managing_Hosts-Managing_Hosts-Creating_a_Host[Creating a Host] in the _Managing Hosts_ guide.
+
The SSH keys of the *Owned by* user are added automatically when the `create_users` snippet is executed during the provisioning process. You can set *Owned by* to an individual user or a user group. If you set *Owned by* to a user group, the SSH keys of all users in the user group are added automatically.

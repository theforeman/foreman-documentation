= Creating Hosts from Discovered Hosts

Provisioning discovered hosts follows a provisioning process that is similar to PXE provisioning. The main difference is that instead of manually entering the host's MAC address, you can select the host to provision from the list of discovered hosts.

.Procedure

To create a host from a discovered host, complete the following steps:

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Hosts* > *Discovered host*. Select the host you want to use and click *Provision* to the right of the list.
. Select from one of the two following options:
* To provision a host from a host group, select a host group, organization, and location, and then click *Create Host*.
* To provision a host with further customization, click *Customize Host* and enter the additional details you want to specify for the new host.
. Verify that the fields are populated with values. Note in particular:
+
* The *Name* from the *Host* tab becomes the *DNS name*.
* {ProjectServer} automatically assigns an IP address for the new host.
* {ProjectServer} automatically populates the MAC address from the Discovery results.
+
. Ensure that {ProjectServer} automatically selects the *Managed*, *Primary*, and *Provision* options for the first interface on the host. If not, select them.
. Click the *Operating System* tab, and verify that all fields contain values. Confirm each aspect of the operating system.
. Click *Resolve* in *Provisioning template* to check the new host can identify the right provisioning templates to use. The host must resolve to the following provisioning templates:
+
* *kexec Template:* `Discovery Red Hat kexec`
* *provision Template:* `{Project} Kickstart Default`
+
For more information about associating provisioning templates, see xref:provisioning-templates_provisioning[].
. Click *Submit* to save the host details.

When the host provisioning is complete, the discovered host becomes a content host. To view the host, navigate to *Hosts* > *Content Hosts*.

.For CLI Users

. Identify the discovered host to use for provisioning:
+
----
# hammer discovery list
----

. Select a host and provision it using a host group. Set a new host name with the `--new-name` option:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer discovery provision --name "_host_name_" \
--new-name "_new_host_name_" --organization "_My_Organization_" \
--location "_My_Location_" --hostgroup "_My_Host_Group_" --build true \
--enabled true --managed true
----
+
This removes the host from the discovered host listing and creates a host entry with the provisioning settings. The Discovery image automatically resets the host so that it can boot to PXE. The host detects the DHCP service on {ProjectServer}'s integrated {SmartProxy} and starts installing the operating system. The rest of the process is identical to normal PXE workflow described in xref:Provisioning_Bare_Metal_Hosts-Creating_New_Hosts_with_Unattended_Provisioning[].

= Implementing PXE-less Discovery

{Project} provides a PXE-less Discovery service that operates without the need for PXE-based services (DHCP and TFTP).
You accomplish this using {ProjectServer}'s Discovery image.
Once a discovered node is scheduled for installation, it uses `kexec` command to reload Linux kernel with OS installer without rebooting the node.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Discovery `kexec` is a Technology Preview feature only.
Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete.
Red Hat does not recommend using them in production.
These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.
For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/.

The ISO for the Discovery service resides at `/usr/share/foreman-discovery-image/` and is installed using the `foreman-discovery-image` package.

.Attended Use

. Copy this media to either a CD, DVD, or a USB stick.
For example, to copy to a USB stick at `/dev/sdb`:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# dd bs=4M \
if=/usr/share/foreman-discovery-image/foreman-discovery-image-3.4.4-5.iso \
of=/dev/sdb
----
+
. Insert the Discovery boot media into a bare metal host, start the host, and boot from the media.
The Discovery Image displays an option for either *Manual network setup* or *Discovery with DHCP*:
+
If you select *Manual network setup*, the Discovery image requests a set of network options.
This includes the primary network interface that connects to {ProjectServer}.
This Discovery image also asks for network interface configuration options, such as an *IPv4 Address*, *IPv4 Gateway*, and an *IPv4 DNS* server.
+
. After entering these details, select *Next*.
. If you select *Discovery with DHCP*, the Discovery image requests only the primary network interface that connects to {ProjectServer}.
It attempts to automatically configure the network interface using a DHCP server, such as one that a {SmartProxyServer} provides.
. After the primary interface configuration, the Discovery image requests the *Server URL*, which is the URL of {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer} offering the Discovery service.
For example, to use the integrated {SmartProxy} on {ProjectServer}, use the following URL:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
https://{foreman-example-com}:{smartproxy_port}
----
+
. Set the *Connection type* to `Proxy`, then select *Next*.

. Optional: The Discovery image also provides a set of fields to input *Custom facts* for the Facter tool to relay back to {ProjectServer}.
These are entered in a *name*-*value* format.
Provide any custom facts you require and select *Confirm* to continue.

{Project} reports a successful communication with {ProjectServer}'s Discovery service.
Navigate to *Hosts* > *Discovered Hosts* and view the newly discovered host.

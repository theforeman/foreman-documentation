[[Configuring_Provisioning_Resources]]
== Configuring Provisioning Resources

{Project} contains provisioning resources that you must set up and configure to create a host. These include:

Provisioning template::
While you can create static provisioning templates, for example Kickstart templates, {Project} has many provisioning templates  in ERB (Embedded Ruby) syntax that you can use to modularize parameters in each host or host group. For example, the timezone setting in a kickstart template can differ depending on the given host parameter. Depending on a provisioning workflow, you can set various combinations.

Partition table::
A Partition table is a type of template used only for rendering the disk volume definition part of kickstart. A Partition table uses the same ERB syntax as provisioning templates. You can use a Partition table to define multiple disk layouts and select them for each host or host group depending on the system purpose.

Installation media::
Installation media represents a parametrized URL to a remote repository with OS packages, for example `yum` or `apt`.
ifeval::["{build}" == "foreman"]
When you install the Katello plugin, you can download packages from a Pulp mirror. In this case, installation media is ignored.
endif::[]
ifeval::["{build}" == "satellite"]
You can use this parameter to install third-party content. Red Hat content is delivered through repository syncing feature instead.
endif::[]

ifeval::["{build}" != "foreman-deb"]
Subscriptions and Repositories::

To consume Red Hat content, you must upload subscriptions to {ProjectName}. You must create a Product for the subscription. You must enable and synchronize one or more installation repositories in the initial lifecycle environment *Library*. Optionally, content can be filtered and promoted to other Lifecycle Environments or Content Views.
endif::[]
ifeval::["{build}" == "foreman"]
Subscriptions and repositories are provided by the Katello plugin.
endif::[]

[[Configuring_Provisioning_Resources-Creating_Operating_Systems]]
=== Creating Operating Systems

An operating system is a collection of resources that define how {ProjectServer} installs a base operating system on a host. Operating system entries combine previously defined resources, such as installation media, partition tables, provisioning templates, and others.

ifeval::["{build}" != "foreman-deb"]
Importing operating systems from Red Hat's CDN creates new entries on the *Hosts* > *Operating Systems* page.
endif::[]
ifeval::["{build}" == "foreman"]
Importing operating systems from Red Hat's CDN is only possible when Katello is installed.
endif::[]

You can also add custom operating systems using the following procedure:

.Procedure

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Hosts* > *Operating systems* and click *New Operating* system.
. In the *Name* field, enter a name to represent the operating system entry.
. In the *Major* field, enter the number that corresponds to the major version of the operating system.
. In the *Minor* field, enter the number that corresponds to the minor version of the operating system.
. In the *Description* field, enter a description of the operating system.
. From the *Family* list, select the operating system's family.
. From the *Root Password Hash* list, select the encoding method for the root password.
. From the *Architectures* list, select the architectures that the operating system uses.

--hardware-model "_hardware_model_" --vendor-class "_vendor_class_"
----

[[Configuring_Provisioning_Resources-Using_Kickstart_Repository_as_Installation_Medium]]
=== Using a Synced Kickstart Repository for a Host's Operating System

ifeval::["{build}" == "foreman"]
The following feature is provided by Katello plugin.
endif::[]

{Project} contains a set of synchronized kickstart repositories that you use to install the provisioned host's operating system. For more information about adding repositories, see {BaseURL}content_management_guide/importing_red_hat_content#Importing_Red_Hat_Content-Synchronizing_Red_Hat_Repositories[Synchronizing Red Hat Repositories] in the _Content Management Guide_.


To set up a kickstart repository, complete the following steps:

. Add the synchronized kickstart repository that you want to use to the existing Content View or create a new Content View and add the kickstart repository.
+
For {RHEL} 8, ensure that you add both *{RHEL} 8 for x86_64 - AppStream Kickstart x86_64 8* and *{RHEL} 8 for x86_64 - BaseOS Kickstart x86_64 8* repositories.
ifeval::["{build}" == "satellite"]
+
If you use a disconnected environment, you must import the Kickstart repositories from a {RHEL} binary DVD. For more information, see {BaseURL}content_management_guide/importing-kickstart-repositories_content-management[Importing Kickstart Repositories] in the _Content Management Guide_.
endif::[]
+
. Publish a new version of the Content View where the kickstart repository is added and promote it to a required lifecycle environment. For more information, see {BaseURL}content_management_guide/managing_content_views[Managing Content Views] in the _Content Management Guide_.
. When you create a host, in the *Operating System* tab, for *Media Selection*, select the *Synced Content* check box.

.To View the Kickstart Tree

To view the kickstart tree enter the following command:

[subs="+quotes"]

[[Configuring_Provisioning_Resources-Creating_Partition_Tables]]
=== Creating Partition Tables

A partition table is a set of directives that defines the way {ProjectServer} configures the disks available on a new host. {ProjectNameX} contains a set of default partition tables to use, including a `Kickstart default`. You can also edit partition table entries to configure the preferred partitioning scheme, or create a partition table entry and add it to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system entry.

.Procedure

To create partition tables, complete the following steps:

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Hosts* > *Partition Tables* and, in the Partition Tables window, click *Create Partition Table*.
. In the *Name* field, enter a name to represent the partition table.
. Select the *Default* check box if you want to set the template to automatically associate with new organizations or locations.
. Select the *Snippet* check box if you want to identify the template as a reusable snippet for other partition tables.
. From the *Operating System Family* list, select the distribution or family of the partitioning layout. For example, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, and Fedora are in the Red Hat family.
. In the *Template editor* field, enter the layout for the disk partition. For example:
+
----
zerombr
clearpart --all --initlabel
autopart
----
+
You can also use the *Template* file browser to upload a template file.
+
The format of the layout must match that for the intended operating system. For example, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2 requires a layout that matches a kickstart file.
+
. In the *Audit Comment* field, add a summary of changes to the partition layout.
. Click the *Organizations* and *Locations* tabs to add any other provisioning contexts that you want to associate with the partition table. {Project} adds the partition table to the current provisioning context.
. Click *Submit* to save your partition table.

.For CLI Users

Before you create a partition table with the CLI, create a plain text file that contains the partition layout. This example uses the `~/my-partition` file. Create the installation medium using the `hammer partition-table create` command:

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer partition-table create --name "My Partition" --snippet false \
--os-family Redhat --file ~/my-partition --organizations "_My_Organization_" \
--locations "_My_Location_"
----

[[Configuring_Provisioning_Resources-Creating_Provisioning_Templates]]
=== Creating Provisioning Templates

A provisioning template defines the way {ProjectServer} installs an operating system on a host.

[[Configuring_Provisioning_Resources-Types_of_Provisioning_Templates]]
==== Types of Provisioning Templates

There are various types of provisioning templates, including:

*Provision*

The main template for the provisioning process. For example, a kickstart template. For more information about kickstart template syntax, see the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Installation_Guide/sect-kickstart-syntax.html[Kickstart Syntax Reference] in the _Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Installation Guide_.

*PXELinux*, *PXEGrub*, *PXEGrub2*

PXE-based templates that deploy to the template {SmartProxy} associated with a subnet to ensure that the host uses the installer with the correct kernel options. For BIOS provisioning, select *PXELinux* template. For UEFI provisioning, select *PXEGrub2*.

*Finish*

Post-configuration scripts to execute using an SSH connection when the main provisioning process completes. You can use Finishing templates only for imaged-based provisioning in virtual or cloud environments that do not support user_data. Do not confuse an image with a foreman discovery ISO, which is sometimes called a Foreman discovery image. An image in this context is an install image in a virtualized environment for easy deployment.

When a finish script successfully exits with the return code `0`, {ProjectName} treats the code as a success and the host exits the build mode. Note that there are a few finish scripts with a build mode that uses a _call back_ HTTP call. These scripts are not used for image-based provisioning, but for post configuration of operating-system installations such as Debian, Ubuntu, and BSD.

*user_data*

Post-configuration scripts for providers that accept custom data, also known as seed data. You can use the user_data template to provision virtual machines in cloud or virtualised environments only. This template does not require {Project} to be able to reach the host; the cloud or virtualization platform is responsible for delivering the data to the image.

Ensure that the image that you want to provision has the software to read the data installed and set to start during boot. For example, `cloud-init`, which expects YAML input, or `ignition`, which expects JSON input.

*cloud_init*

Some environments, such as VMWare, either do not support custom data or have their own data format that limits what can be done during customization. In this case, you can configure a cloud-init client with the `foreman` plug-in, which attempts to download the template directly from {Project} over HTTP or HTTPS. This technique can be used in any environment, preferably virtualized.

Ensure that you meet the following requirements to use the `cloud_init` template:

* Ensure that the image that you want to provision has the software to read the data installed and set to start during boot.
* A provisioned host is able to reach {Project} from the IP address that matches the host's provisioning interface IP.

Note that cloud-init does not work behind NAT.

*Bootdisk*

Templates for PXE-less boot methods.

*Kernel Execution (kexec)*

Kernel execution templates for PXE-less boot methods.

ifeval::["{build}" == "satellite"]
[NOTE]
====
Kernel Execution is a Technology Preview feature. Technology Preview features are not fully supported under Red Hat Subscription Service Level Agreements (SLAs), may not be functionally complete, and are not intended for production use. However, these features provide early access to upcoming product innovations, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.
====
endif::[]

*Script*

An arbitrary script not used by default but useful for custom tasks.

*ZTP*

Zero Touch Provisioning templates.

*POAP*

PowerOn Auto Provisioning templates.

*iPXE*

Templates for `iPXE` or `gPXE` environments to use instead of PXELinux.

==== Template Syntax and Management

{ProjectName} includes many template examples. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Hosts* > *Provisioning templates* to view them. You can create a template or clone a template and edit the clone. For help with templates, navigate to *Hosts* > *Provisioning templates* > *Create Template* > *Help*.

Templates accept the Embedded Ruby (ERB) syntax. For more information, see {BaseURL}managing_hosts/appe-red_hat_satellite-managing_hosts-template_writing_reference[Template Writing Reference] in _Managing Hosts_.

You can download provisioning templates. Before you can download the template, you must create a debug certificate. For more information, see {BaseURL}content_management_guide/managing_organizations#Managing_Organizations-Creating_an_Organization_Debug_Certificate[Creating an Organization Debug Certificate] in the _Content Management Guide_.

You can synchronize templates between {ProjectServer} and a Git repository or a local directory. For more information, see {BaseURL}managing_hosts/synchronizing_templates_repositories[Synchronizing Templates Repositories] in the _Managing Hosts_ guide.

.Change logs and history

To view the history of changes applied to a template, navigate to *Hosts* > *Provisioning templates*, select one of the templates, and click *History*. Click *Revert* to override the editor content with the previous version. It is possible to revert to an earlier change as well. Click *Show Diff* to see information about a specific change:

. *Template Diff* tab displays changes in the body of a provisioning template.
. *Details* tab displays changes in the template description.
. *History* tab displays the user who made a change to the template and date of the change.

==== Procedure

To create a template, complete the following step:

* In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Hosts* > *Provisioning Templates* and, in the Provisioning Templates window, click *Create Template*.

The *Help* tab provides information about the template syntax. It details the available functions, variables, and methods that can be called on different types of objects within the template.

Alternatively, to clone a template and add your updates to the clone, complete the following steps:

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Hosts* > *Provisioning Templates* and search for the template that you want to use.
. On the template that you want to use, click *Clone* to duplicate it.
. In the *Name* field, enter a name for the provisioning template.
. Select the *Default* check box to set the template to associate automatically with new organizations or locations.
. In the *Template editor* field, enter the body of the provisioning template. You can also use the *Template* file browser to upload a template file.
. In the *Audit Comment* field, enter a summary of changes to the provisioning template for auditing purposes.
. Click the *Type* tab and if your template is a snippet, select the *Snippet* check box. A snippet is not a standalone provisioning template, but a part of a provisioning template that can be inserted into other provisioning templates.
. From the *Type* list, select the type of the template. For example, *Provisioning template*.
. Click the *Association* tab and from the *Applicable Operating Systems* list, select the names of the operating systems that you want to associate with the provisioning template.
. Optionally, click *Add combination* and select a host group from the *Host Group* list or an environment from the *Environment* list to associate provisioning template with the host groups and environments.
. Click the *Organizations* and *Locations* tabs to add any additional contexts to the template.
. Click *Submit* to save your provisioning template.

.For CLI Users

Before you create a template with the CLI, create a plain text file that contains the template. This example uses the `~/my-template` file. Create the installation medium using the `hammer template create` command and specify the type with the `--type` option:

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer template create --name "My Provisioning Template" \
--file ~/my-template --type provision --organizations "_My_Organization_" \
--locations "_My_Location_"
----



[[Configuring_Provisioning_Resources-Creating_Compute_Profiles]]
=== Creating Compute Profiles

Compute profiles are used in conjunction with compute resources, such as virtualization infrastructure and cloud providers. Compute profiles allow users to predefine hardware such as CPUs, memory, and storage. A default installation of {ProjectNameX} contains three predefined profiles:

  - `1-Small`
  - `2-Medium`
  - `3-Large`


.Procedure

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Infrastructure* > *Compute Profiles*, and in the Compute Profiles window, click *Create Compute Profile*.
. In the *Name* field, enter a name for the profile and click *Submit*.

.For CLI Users

The compute profile CLI commands are not yet implemented in {ProjectName} {ProductVersion}.

[[Configuring_Provisioning_Resources-Setting_Default_Root_Password]]

=== Setting a Default Encrypted Root Password for Hosts

If you do not want to set a plain text default root password for the hosts that you provision, you can use a default encrypted password.

To set a default encrypted password for your hosts, complete the following steps:

. Generate an encrypted password. You can use the following command to generate a password:
+
-----------------
# python -c 'import crypt,getpass;pw=getpass.getpass(); print(crypt.crypt(pw)) if (pw==getpass.getpass("Confirm: ")) else exit()'
-----------------
+
. Copy the password for later use.
. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Administer* > *Settings*.
. On the *Settings* page, select the *Provisioning* tab.
. In the *Name* column, navigate to *Root password*, and click *Click to edit*.
. Paste the encrypted password that you generate, and click *Save*.


[[Configuring_Provisioning_Resources-Creating_Installation_Media]]
=== Using Third Party Installation Media

Installation media are sources of files for third parties that {ProjectServer} uses to install a third-party base operating system on a machine. Installation media must be in the format of an operating system installation tree, and must be accessible to the machine hosting the installer through an HTTP URL. You can view installation media by navigating to *Hosts* > *Installation Media* menu.

For other installation media, for example, a locally mounted ISO image, you can add your own custom media paths using the following procedure.

.Procedure

To create installation media, complete the following steps:

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Hosts* > *Installation Media* and click *Create Medium*.
. In the *Name* field, enter a name to represent the installation media entry.
. In the *Path* enter the URL or NFS share that contains the installation tree. You can use following variables in the path to represent multiple different system architectures and versions:
  * `$arch` - The system architecture.
  * `$version` - The operating system version.
  * `$major` - The operating system major version.
  * `$minor` - The operating system minor version.
+
Example HTTP path:
+
----
http://download.example.com/centos/$version/Server/$arch/os/
----
+
Example NFS path:
+
----
nfs://download.example.com:/centos/$version/Server/$arch/os/
----
+
Synchronized content on {SmartProxyServer}s always uses an HTTP path. {SmartProxyServer} managed content does not support NFS paths.
+
. From the *Operating system family* list, select the distribution or family of the installation medium. For example, CentOS, and Fedora are in the `Red Hat` family.
. Click the *Organizations* and *Locations* tabs, to change the provisioning context. {ProjectServer} adds the installation medium to the set provisioning context.
. Click *Submit* to save your installation medium.

.For CLI Users

[[Configuring_Provisioning_Resources-Accessing_Virtual_Machines_with_the_noVNC_Console]]
=== Using noVNC to Access Virtual Machines

You can use your browser to access the VNC console of VMs created by {Project}.

{Project} supports using noVNC on the following virtualization platforms:

* VMware
* Libvirt
* {OVirt}

Use the following procedure to configure your virtualization platform and browser to enable the use of the noVNC console.

.Prerequisites

* You must have a virtual machine created by {Project}.
* For existing virtual machines, ensure that the *Display type* in the *Compute Resource* settings is *VNC*.
* You must import the Katello root CA certificate into your {ProjectServer}. Adding a security exception in the browser is not enough for using noVNC. For more information, see the link:{BaseURL}administering_red_hat_satellite/chap-red_hat_satellite-administering_red_hat_satellite-accessing_red_hat_satellite#sect-{Project_Link}-Administering_{Project_Link}-Installing_the_Katello_Root_CA_Certificate[Installing the Katello Root CA Certificate] section in the _Administering {ProjectName}_ guide.

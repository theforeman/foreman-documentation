[[Provisioning_Virtual_Machines_in_Azure]]
== Provisioning Cloud Instances in Microsoft Azure Resource Manager
{ProjectName} can interact with Microsoft Azure Resource Manager, including creating new virtual machines and controlling their power management states. Only image-based provisioning is supported for creating Azure hosts.

Note that {Project} does not support Azure Government.

[[Provisioning_Virtual_Machines_in_Azure-Prerequisites_for_Azure_Provisioning]]
=== Prerequisites for Azure Provisioning

Before you begin, ensure that the following conditions are met:

* Ensure that you have the correct permissions to create an Azure Active Directory application. For more information, see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal#required-permissions[Check Azure AD permissions] in the _Microsoft identity platform (Azure Active Directory for developers)_ documentation.
* You must create and configure an Azure Active Directory application and service principle to obtain Application or _client_ ID, Directory or _tenant_ ID, and Client Secret. For more information, see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal[Use the portal to create an Azure AD application and service principal that can access resources] in the _Microsoft identity platform (Azure Active Directory for developers)_ documentation. 
* Optional: If you want to use Puppet with Azure hosts, navigate to *Administer* > *Settings* > *Puppet* and enable the `Use UUID for certificates` setting to configure Puppet to use consistent Puppet certificate IDs.
* Based on your needs, associate a `finish` or `user_data` provisioning template with the operating system you want to use. For more information about provisioning templates, see xref:Configuring_Provisioning_Resources-Types_of_Provisioning_Templates[].
* Optional: If you want the virtual machine to use a static private IP address, create a subnet in {Project} with the *Network Address* field matching the Azure subnet address.

[[Provisioning_Virtual_Machines_in_Azure-Adding_Azure_Details_to_a_Compute_Profile]]
=== Adding Azure Details to a Compute Profile

You can add Azure details to a compute profile to automatically populate virtual machine-based settings on host creation. For more information about Azure Resource Manager concepts, see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/[Azure Resource Manager documentation].

.Procedure

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Infrastructure* > *Compute Profiles* and click the name of a compute profile to use.
. Select an Azure compute resource.
. From the *Resource group* list, select the resource group to provision to.
. From the *VM Size* list, select a size of a virtual machine to provision.
. From the *Platform* list, select *Linux*. {Project} does not support provisioning virtual machines running Microsoft operating systems.
. In the *Username* field, enter a user name to authenticate with. Note that the username that you enter for compute profile must be the same that you use when creating an image.
. To authenticate the user, use one of the following options:
+
* To authenticate using a password, enter a password in the *Password* field.
+
* To authenticate using an SSH key, enter an SSH key inn the *SSH Key* field.
. Optional: If you want the virtual machine to use a premium virtual machine disk, select the *Premium OS Disk* check box.
. From the *OS Disk Caching* list, select the disc caching setting.
. Optional: In the *Custom Script Command* field, enter commands to perform on the virtual machine when the virtual machine is provisioned.
. Optional: If you want to run custom scripts when provisioning finishes, in the *Comma separated file URIs* field, enter comma-separated file URIs of scripts to use. The scripts must contain `sudo` at the beginning because {ProjectName} downloads files to the `/var/lib/waagent/custom-script/download/0/` directory on the host and scripts require sudo privileges to be executed.
. Click *Add Interface*.
. From the *Azure Subnet* list, select the Azure subnet to provision to.
. From the *Public IP* list, select the public IP setting.
. Optional: If you want the virtual machine to use a static private IP, select the *Static Private IP* check box.
. Click *Submit*.

.For CLI Users

. Create a compute profile to use with the Azure Resource Manager compute resource:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer compute-profile create --name _compute_profile_name_
----

. Add Azure details to the compute profile. With the `username` setting, enter the SSH user name for image access. Note that the username that you enter for compute profile must be the same that you use when creating an image.
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer compute-profile values create \
--compute-profile "_compute_profile_name_" \
--compute-resource _azure_cr_name_ \
--compute-attributes="resource_group=_resource_group_,vm_size=_Standard_B1s_,username=_azure_user_,password=_azure_password_,platform=Linux,script_command=touch /var/tmp/text.txt" \
--interface="compute_public_ip=Dynamic,compute_network=mysubnetID,compute_private_ip=false"
----
+
Optional: If you want to run scripts on the virtual machine after provisioning, specify the following settings:
+
* To enter the script directly, with the `script_command` setting, enter a command to be executed on the provisioned virtual machine.
* To run a script from a URI, with the `script_uris` setting, enter comma-separated file URIs of scripts to use. The scripts must contain `sudo` at the beginning because {ProjectName} downloads files to the `/var/lib/waagent/custom-script/download/0/` directory on the host and therefore scripts require sudo privileges to be executed.

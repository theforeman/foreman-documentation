= Unattended Use, Customization, and Image Remastering

You can create a customized Discovery ISO to automate the image configuration process after booting.
The Discovery image uses a Linux kernel for the operating system, which passes kernel parameters to configure the discovery service.
These kernel parameters include the following entries:

proxy.url::
  The URL of the {SmartProxyServer} or {ProjectServer} providing the Discovery service.

proxy.type::
  The proxy type.
This is usually set to `proxy` to connect to {SmartProxyServer}.
This parameter also supports a legacy `foreman` option, where communication goes directly to {ProjectServer} instead of a {SmartProxyServer}.

fdi.pxmac::
  The MAC address of the primary interface in the format of `AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF`.
This is the interface you aim to use for communicating with {SmartProxyServer}.
In automated mode, the first NIC (using network identifiers in alphabetical order) with a link is used.
In semi-automated mode, a screen appears and requests you to select the correct interface.

fdi.pxip, fdi.pxgw, fdi.pxdns::
  Manually configures IP address (`fdi.pxip`), the gateway (`fdi.pxgw`), and the DNS (`fdi.pxdns`) for the primary network interface.
If your omit these parameters, the image uses DHCP to configure the network interface.

fdi.pxfactname1, fdi.pxfactname2 ... fdi.pxfactnameN::
  Use to specify custom fact names.

fdi.pxfactvalue1, fdi.pxfactvalue2 ... fdi.pxfactvalueN::
  The values for each custom fact.
Each value corresponds to a fact name.
For example, `fdi.pxfactvalue1` sets the value for the fact named with `fdi.pxfactname1`.

fdi.pxauto::
  To set automatic or semi-automatic mode.
If set to 0, the image uses semi-automatic mode, which allows you to confirm your choices through a set of dialog options.
If set to 1, the image uses automatic mode and proceeds without any confirmation.

fdi.initnet::
  By default, the image initializes all network interfaces (value `all`).
When this setting is set to `bootif`, only the network interface it was network-booted from will be initialized.

fdi.rootpw::
  By default, the `root` account is locked.
Use this option to set a root password.
You can enter both clear and encrypted passwords.

fdi.ssh::
  By default, the SSH service is disabled.
Set this to `1` or `true` to enable SSH access.

fdi.ipv4.method::
  By default, NetworkManager IPv4 method setting is set to `auto`.
This option overrides it, set it to `ignore` to disable the IPv4 stack.
This option works only in DHCP mode.

fdi.ipv6.method::
  By default, NetworkManager IPv6 method setting is set to `auto`.
This option overrides it, set it to `ignore` to disable the IPv6 stack.
This option only works in DHCP mode.

.Using the `discovery-remaster` Tool to Remaster an OS Image

ifeval::["{build}" == "satellite"]
{ProjectServer} provides the `discovery-remaster` tool in the `foreman-discovery-image` package.
This tool remasters the image to include these kernel parameters.
To remaster the image, run the `discovery-remaster` tool.
For example:
endif::[]

ifeval::["{build}" == "foreman-el"]
{ProjectServer} provides the `discovery-remaster` tool.
This tool remasters the image to include these kernel parameters.
To remaster the image, run the `discovery-remaster` tool.
For example:
endif::[]

Copy this media to either a CD, DVD, or a USB stick.
For example, to copy to a USB stick at `/dev/sdb`:

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# dd bs=4M \
if=/usr/share/foreman-discovery-image/foreman-discovery-image-3.4.4-5.iso \
of=/dev/sdb
----

Insert the Discovery boot media into a bare metal host, start the host, and boot from the media.

== Using Infoblox as DHCP and DNS Providers

You can use {SmartProxyServer} to connect to your Infoblox application to create and manage DHCP and DNS records, and to reserve IP addresses.

ifeval::["{build}" == "satellite"]
The supported Infoblox version is NIOS 8.0 or higher and {ProjectXY} or higher.
endif::[]

=== Limitations

All DHCP and DNS records can be managed only in a single Network or DNS view, After you install the Infoblox modules on {SmartProxy} and set up the view using the `{foreman-installer}` command, you cannot edit the view.

{SmartProxyServer} communicates with a single Infoblox node using the standard HTTPS web API. If you want to configure clustering and High Availability, make the configurations in Infoblox.

Hosting PXE-related files using Infoblox's TFTP functionality is not supported. You must use {SmartProxy} as a TFTP server for PXE provisioning. For more information, see xref:Configuring_Networking[].

{Project} IPAM feature cannot be integrated with Infoblox.

=== Prerequisites

You must have Infoblox account credentials to manage DHCP and DNS entries in {Project}.

Ensure that you have Infoblox administration roles with the names: `DHCP Admin` and `DNS Admin`.

The administration roles must have permissions or belong to an admin group that permits the accounts to perform tasks through the Infoblox API.

=== Installing the Infoblox CA Certificate on {SmartProxyServer}

You must install Infoblox HTTPS CA certificate on the base system for all {SmartProxies} that you want to integrate with Infoblox applications.

You can download the certificate from the Infoblox web UI, or you can use the following OpenSSL commands to download the certificate:

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# update-ca-trust enable
# openssl s_client -showcerts -connect _infoblox.example.com_:443 </dev/null | \
openssl x509 -text >/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/infoblox.crt
# update-ca-trust extract
----

* The `_infoblox.example.com_` entry must match the host name for the Infoblox application in the X509 certificate.


To test the CA certificate, use a CURL query:
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# curl -u admin:password https://_infoblox.example.com_/wapi/v2.0/network
----

Example positive response:

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
[
    {
        "_ref": "network/ZG5zLm5ldHdvcmskMTkyLjE2OC4yMDIuMC8yNC8w:__infoblox.example.com__/24/default",
        "network": "192.168.202.0/24",
        "network_view": "default"
    }
]
----

ifeval::["{build}" == "satellite"]
Use the following Red{nbsp}Hat Knowledgebase article to install the certificate: https://access.redhat.com/solutions/1519813[How to install a CA certificate on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 / 7].

[[Infoblox-Integration-Installing_the_DHCP_Infoblox_Module]]
=== Installing the DHCP Infoblox module

Use this procedure to install the DHCP Infoblox module on {SmartProxy}. Note that you cannot manage records in separate views.

You can also install DHCP and DNS Infoblox modules simultaneously by combining this procedure and xref:Infoblox-Integration-Installing_the_DNS_Infoblox_Module[]

.DHCP Infoblox Record Type Considerations

Use only the `--foreman-proxy-plugin-dhcp-infoblox-record-type fixedaddress` option to configure the DHCP and DNS modules.

Configuring both DHCP and DNS Infoblox modules with the `host` record type setting causes DNS conflicts and is not supported. If you install the Infoblox module on {SmartProxyServer} with the `--foreman-proxy-plugin-dhcp-infoblox-record-type` option set to `host`, you must unset both DNS {SmartProxy} and Reverse DNS {SmartProxy} options because Infoblox does the DNS management itself. You cannot use the `host` option without creating conflicts and, for example, being unable to rename hosts in {Project}.

.Procedure

To install the Infoblox module for DHCP, complete the following steps:

. On {SmartProxy}, enter the following command:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----

# {foreman-installer} --enable-foreman-proxy-plugin-dhcp-infoblox \
--foreman-proxy-dhcp true \
--foreman-proxy-dhcp-managed false \
--foreman-proxy-dhcp-provider infoblox \
--foreman-proxy-plugin-dhcp-infoblox-record-type fixedaddress \
--foreman-proxy-dhcp-server _infoblox.example.com_ \
--foreman-proxy-plugin-dhcp-infoblox-username admin \
--foreman-proxy-plugin-dhcp-infoblox-password infoblox \
--foreman-proxy-plugin-dhcp-infoblox-network-view default \
--foreman-proxy-plugin-dhcp-infoblox-dns-view default

----

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Infrastructure* > *{SmartProxies}* and select the {SmartProxy} with the Infoblox DHCP module and click *Refresh*.
. Ensure that the *dhcp* features are listed.
. For all domains managed through Infoblox, ensure that the DNS {SmartProxy} is set for that domain. To verify, in the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Infrastructure* > *Domains*, and inspect the settings of each domain.
. For all subnets managed through Infoblox, ensure that DHCP {SmartProxy} and Reverse DNS {SmartProxy} is set. To verify, in the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Infrastructure* > *Subnets*, and inspect the settings of each subnet.

[[Infoblox-Integration-Installing_the_DNS_Infoblox_Module]]
=== Installing the DNS Infoblox Module

Use this procedure to install the DNS Infoblox module on {SmartProxy}. You can also install DHCP and DNS Infoblox modules simultaneously by combining this procedure and xref:Infoblox-Integration-Installing_the_DHCP_Infoblox_Module[].

DNS records are managed only in the default DNS view, it's not possible to specify which DNS view to use.

To install the DNS Infoblox module, complete the following steps:

. On {SmartProxy}, enter the following command to configure the Infoblox module:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-installer} --enable-foreman-proxy-plugin-dns-infoblox \
--foreman-proxy-dns true \
--foreman-proxy-dns-managed false \
--foreman-proxy-dns-provider infoblox \
--foreman-proxy-plugin-dns-infoblox-dns-server _infoblox.example.com_ \
--foreman-proxy-plugin-dns-infoblox-username admin \
--foreman-proxy-plugin-dns-infoblox-password infoblox \
--foreman-proxy-plugin-dns-infoblox-dns-view default
----
+
Optionally, you can change the value of the `--foreman-proxy-plugin-dns-infoblox-dns-view` option to specify a DNS Infoblox view other than the default view.

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Infrastructure* > *{SmartProxies}* and select the {SmartProxy} with the Infoblox DNS module and click *Refresh*.
. Ensure that the *dns* features are listed.

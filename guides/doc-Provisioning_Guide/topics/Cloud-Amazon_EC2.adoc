[[Provisioning_Cloud_Instances_in_Amazon_EC2]]
== Provisioning Cloud Instances in Amazon EC2

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides public cloud compute resources.
Using {Project}, you can interact with Amazon EC2's public API to create cloud instances and control their power management states.
Use the procedures in this chapter to add a connection to an Amazon EC2 account and provision a cloud instance.

[[Provisioning_Cloud_Instances_in_Amazon_EC2-Prerequisites_for_Amazon_EC2_Provisioning]]
=== Prerequisites for Amazon EC2 Provisioning

The requirements for Amazon EC2 provisioning include:

  * A {SmartProxyServer} managing a network in your EC2 environment.
Use a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to ensure a secure network between the hosts and the {SmartProxyServer}.
  * An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) for image-based provisioning.

[[Provisioning_Cloud_Instances_in_Amazon_EC2-Adding_a_Amazon_EC2_Connection_to_the_Satellite_Server]]
=== Adding an Amazon EC2 Connection to the {ProjectServer}

Use this procedure to add the Amazon EC2 connection in the {ProjectServer}'s compute resources.

.Time Settings and Amazon Web Services
Amazon Web Services uses time settings as part of the authentication process.
Ensure that {ProjectServer}'s time is correctly synchronized.
Ensure that an NTP service, such as `ntpd` or `chronyd`, is running properly on the {ProjectServer}.
Failure to provide the correct time to Amazon Web Services can lead to authentication failures.

For more information about synchronizing time in {Project}, see {InstallingProjectDocURL}synchronizing-the-system-clock-with-chronyd_{project-context}[Synchronizing Time] in _{project-installation-guide-title}_.


.Procedure

To add an Amazon EC2 connection, complete the following steps:

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Infrastructure* > *Compute Resources* and in the Compute Resources window, click *Create Compute Resource*.
. In the *Name* field, enter a name to identify the Amazon EC2 compute resource.
. From the *Provider* list, select *EC2*.
. In the *Description* field, enter information that helps distinguish the resource for future use.
. Optional: From the *HTTP proxy* list, select an HTTP proxy to connect to external API services.
You must add HTTP proxies to {Project} before you can select a proxy from this list.
For more information, see xref:Provisioning_Cloud_Instances_in_Amazon_EC2-Using-an-HTTP-Smart-Proxy[].
. In the *Access Key* and *Secret Key* fields, enter the access keys for your Amazon EC2 account.
For more information, see http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/managing-aws-access-keys.html[Managing Access Keys for your AWS Account] on the Amazon documentation website.
. Optional: Click the *Load Regions* button to populate the *Regions* list.
. From the *Region* list, select the Amazon EC2 region or data center to use.
. Click the *Locations* tab and ensure that the location you want to use is selected, or add a different location.
. Click the *Organizations* tab and ensure that the organization you want to use is selected, or add a different organization.
. Click *Submit* to save the Amazon EC2 connection.
. Select the new compute resource and then click the *SSH keys* tab, and click *Download* to save a copy of the SSH keys to use for SSH authentication.
Until https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1793138[BZ1793138] is resolved, you can download a copy of the SSH keys only immediately after creating the Amazon EC2 compute resource.
If you require SSH keys at a later stage, follow the procedure in xref:connecting_to_an_Amazon_EC2_instance_using_SSH[].

.For CLI Users

Create the connection with the `hammer compute-resource create` command.
Use `--user` and `--password` options to add the access key and secret key respectively.

--organizations "_My_Organization_"
----

[[Provisioning_Cloud_Instances_in_Amazon_EC2-Using-an-HTTP-Smart-Proxy]]
=== Using an HTTP Proxy with Compute Resources

In some cases, the EC2 compute resource that you use might require a specific HTTP proxy to communicate with {Project}.
In {Project}, you can create an HTTP proxy and then assign the HTTP proxy to your EC2 compute resource.

However, if you configure an HTTP proxy for {Project} in *Administer* > *Settings*, and then add another HTTP proxy for your compute resource, the HTTP proxy that you define in *Administer* > *Settings* takes precedence.

.Procedure

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Infrastructure* > *HTTP Proxies*, and select *New HTTP Proxy*.
. In the *Name* field, enter a name for the HTTP proxy.
. In the *URL* field, enter the URL for the HTTP proxy, including the port number.
. Optional: Enter a username and password to authenticate to the HTTP proxy, if your HTTP proxy requires authentication.
. Click *Test Connection* to ensure that you can connect to the HTTP proxy from {Project}.
. Click the *Locations* tab and add a location.
. Click the *Organization* tab and add an organization.
. Click *Submit*.

. In the *Username* field, enter the SSH user name for image access.
This is normally the `root` user.
. In the *Password* field, enter the SSH password for image access.
. In the *Image ID* field, enter the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) ID for the image.
This is usually in the following format: `ami-xxxxxxxx`.
. Optional: Select the *User Data* check box if the images support user data input, such as `cloud-init` data.
If you enable user data, the Finish scripts are automatically disabled.
This also applies in reverse: if you enable the Finish scripts, this disables user data.
. Optional: In the *IAM role* field, enter the Amazon security role used for creating the image.
. Click *Submit* to save the image details.

.For CLI Users

Create the image with the `hammer compute-resource image create` command.
Use the `--uuid` field to store the full path of the image location on the Amazon EC2 server.

[[connecting_to_an_Amazon_EC2_instance_using_SSH]]
=== Connecting to an Amazon EC2 instance using SSH

You can connect remotely to an Amazon EC2 instance from {ProjectServer} using SSH.
However, to connect to any Amazon Web Services EC2 instance that you provision through {ProjectName}, you must first access the private key that is associated with the compute resource in the Foreman database, and use this key for authentication.

To locate the private key and connect to an Amazon EC2 server using SSH, complete the following steps:

. To locate the compute resource list, on your {ProjectServer} base system, enter the following command, and note the ID of the compute resource that you want to use:
+
----
# hammer compute-resource list
----
+
. Switch user to the `postgres` user:

You can use {ProjectName} finish templates during the provisioning of Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise Linux instances in an Amazon EC2 environment.
endif::[]

ifeval::["{build}" != "satellite"]
You can use {ProjectName} finish templates during the provisioning of Linux instances in an Amazon EC2 environment.
endif::[]

If you want to use a Finish template with SSH, {Project} must reside within the EC2 environment and in the correct security group.
{Project} currently performs SSH finish provisioning directly, not using {SmartProxyServer}.
If {ProjectServer} does not reside within EC2, the EC2 virtual machine reports an internal IP rather than the necessary external IP with which it can be reached.

To configure a finish template for Amazon EC2, complete the following steps:

. In the {ProjectName} web UI, navigate to *Hosts* > *Provisioning Templates*.
. In the *Provisioning Templates* page, enter `Kickstart default finish` into the search field and click *Search*.
. On the *Kickstart default finish* template, select *Clone*.
. In the *Name* field, enter a unique name for the template.
ifeval::["{build}" == "satellite"]
. In the template, prefix each command that requires root privileges with `sudo`, except for `subscription-manager register` and `yum` commands, or add the following line to run the entire template as the sudo user:
endif::[]
ifeval::["{build}" != "satellite"]
. In the template, prefix each command that requires root privileges with `sudo`, except for `yum` or equivalent commands, or add the following line to run the entire template as the `sudo` user:

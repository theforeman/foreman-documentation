[[Provisioning_Cloud_Instances_in_Red_Hat_OpenStack_Platform-Adding_Red_Hat_OpenStack_Platform_Images_on_the_Satellite_Server]]
=== Adding Red Hat OpenStack Platform Images to the Satellite Server

Red Hat OpenStack Platform uses image-based provisioning to create new hosts. You must add image details to your Satellite Server. This includes access details and image location.

.Procedure

To add Red Hat OpenStack Platform images, complete the following steps:

. In the Satellite web UI, navigate to *Infrastructure* > *Compute Resources* and in the Computer Resources window, click the name of a Red Hat OpenStack Platform connection.
. In the *Name* field, enter a name that describes the image.
. From the *Operatingsystem* list, select the image's base operating system.
. From the *Architecture* list, select the operating system architecture.
. In the *User* field, enter the SSH user name for image access. This is normally the `root` user.
. In the *Password* field, enter the SSH password for image access.
. From the *Image* list, select the image in OpenStack Image Storage.
. From the *User data* list, select whether you want to set if images support user data input, such as `cloud-init` data.
. Click *Submit* to save the image details.

.For CLI Users

Create the image with the `hammer compute-resource image create` command. Use the `--uuid` field to store the full path of the image location on the Red Hat OpenStack Platform server.

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer compute-resource image create --name "Test OpenStack Image" \
--operatingsystem "RedHat 7.2" --architecture "x86_64" \
--user root --user-data true \
--compute-resource "_My_OpenStack_Platform_"

The compute profile CLI commands are not yet implemented in Red Hat Satellite {ProductVersion}. As an alternative, you can include the same settings directly during the host creation process.

[[Provisioning_Cloud_Instances_in_Red_Hat_OpenStack_Platform-Creating_Image_Based_Hosts_on_Red_Hat_OpenStack_Platform]]
=== Creating Image-Based Hosts on Red Hat OpenStack Platform

In Satellite, you can provision Red Hat OpenStack Platform hosts from existing images on the Red Hat OpenStack Platform server.

.Procedure

To provision a host, complete the following steps:

. In the Satellite web UI, navigate to *Hosts* > *New Host*.
. In the *Name* field, enter the name that you want to assign to the provisioned system's host.
. From the *Host Group* list, you can select a host group to populate the host fields.
. From the *Deploy on* lits, select the OpenStack Platform connection.
. From the *Compute profile* list, select a profile to use to automatically populate cloud instance-based settings.
. Click the *Interface* tab, and click *Edit* on the host's interface. Verify that the *Name* from the *Host* tab becomes the *DNS name*, and that the Satellite Server automatically assigns an IP address for the new host.
. Ensure that the *MAC address* field is blank. The Red Hat OpenStack Platform server assigns a MAC address to the host.
. Verify that Satellite Server automatically selects the *Managed*, *Primary*, and *Provision* options for the first interface on the host. If not, select them.
. Click the *Operating System* tab, and confirm that each aspect of the operating system is populated.
. If you want to change the image that populates automatically from your compute profile, from the *Images* list, select a different image to base the new host's root volume.
. Click *Resolve* in *Provisioning Templates* to verify that the new host can identify the right provisioning templates to use.
. Click the *Virtual Machine* tab, and verify that the settings are populated with details from the host groups and compute profile. Modify these settings to suit your needs.
. Click the *Parameters* tab and ensure that a parameter exists that provides an activation key. If not, add an activation key.
. Click *Submit* to save the changes.

This new host entry triggers the Red Hat OpenStack Platform server to create the instance, using the pre-existing image as a basis for the new volume.

.For CLI Users

Create the host with the `hammer host create` command and include the `--provision-method image` option to use image-based provisioning.

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer host create --name "openstack-test1" --organization "_My_Organization_" \
--location "New York" --hostgroup "_Example_Hostgroup_" \
--compute-resource "_My_OpenStack_Platform_" --provision-method image \
--image "Test OpenStack Image" --enabled true --managed true \
--interface "managed=true,primary=true,provision=true" \
--compute-attributes="flavor_ref=m1.small,tenant_id=openstack,security_groups=default,network=mynetwork"

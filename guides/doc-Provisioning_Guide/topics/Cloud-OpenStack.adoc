[[Provisioning_Cloud_Instances_in_Red_Hat_OpenStack_Platform-Adding_Red_Hat_OpenStack_Platform_Images_on_the_Satellite_Server]]
=== Adding {OpenStack} Images to the {ProjectServer}

{OpenStack} uses image-based provisioning to create hosts. You must add image details to your {ProjectServer}. This includes access details and image location.

.Procedure

To add {OpenStack} images, complete the following steps:

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Infrastructure* > *Compute Resources* and in the Computer Resources window, click the name of a {OpenStack} connection.
. In the *Name* field, enter a name that describes the image.
. From the *Operatingsystem* list, select the image's base operating system.
. From the *Architecture* list, select the operating system architecture.
. In the *User* field, enter the SSH user name for image access. This is normally the `root` user.
. In the *Password* field, enter the SSH password for image access.
. From the *Image* list, select the image in OpenStack Image Storage.
. From the *User data* list, select whether you want to set if images support user data input, such as `cloud-init` data.
. Click *Submit* to save the image details.

.For CLI Users

Create the image with the `hammer compute-resource image create` command. Use the `--uuid` field to store the full path of the image location on the {OpenStack} server.

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer compute-resource image create --name "Test OpenStack Image" \
--operatingsystem "RedHat 7.2" --architecture "x86_64" \
--user root --user-data true \
--compute-resource "_My_OpenStack_Platform_"

[[Provisioning_Cloud_Instances_in_Red_Hat_OpenStack_Platform-Adding_Red_Hat_OpenStack_Platform_Details_to_a_Compute_Profile]]
=== Adding {OpenStack} Details to a Compute Profile

In {Project}, you can define certain hardware settings for instances on {OpenStack}. You can add these hardware settings to a compute profile.

.Procedure

To add {OpenStack} details to a compute profile, complete the following steps:

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Infrastructure* > *Compute Profiles* and in the Compute Profiles window, click the name of the profile you want to use.
. From the *Flavor* list, select the hardware profile on OpenStack Platform to use for the host.
. From the *Availability zone* list, selec the target cluster to use within the OpenStack Platform environment.
. From the *Image* list, select the image to use for image-based provisioning.
. From the *Tenant* list, select the tenant or project for the OpenStack Platform instance.
. From the *Security Group* list, select the cloud-based access rules for ports and IP addresses.
. From the *Internal network*, select the private networks for the host to join.
. From the *Floating IP network*, select the external networks for the host to join and assign a floating IP address.
. From the *Boot from volume*, select whether a volume is created from the image. If not selected, the instance boots the image directly.
. In the *New boot volume size (GB)* field, enter the size, in GB, of the new boot volume.
. Click *Submit* to save the compute profile.

.For CLI Users

The compute profile CLI commands are not yet implemented in {ProjectName} {ProductVersion}. As an alternative, you can include the same settings directly during the host creation process.

[[Provisioning_Cloud_Instances_in_Red_Hat_OpenStack_Platform-Creating_Image_Based_Hosts_on_Red_Hat_OpenStack_Platform]]
=== Creating Image-Based Hosts on {OpenStack}

In {Project}, you can provision {OpenStack} hosts from existing images on the {OpenStack} server.

.Procedure

To provision a host, complete the following steps:

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Hosts* > *New Host*.
. In the *Name* field, enter the name that you want to assign to the provisioned system's host.
. From the *Host Group* list, you can select a host group to populate the host fields.
. From the *Deploy on* lits, select the OpenStack Platform connection.
. From the *Compute profile* list, select a profile to use to automatically populate cloud instance-based settings.
. Click the *Interface* tab, and click *Edit* on the host's interface. Verify that the *Name* from the *Host* tab becomes the *DNS name*, and that the {ProjectServer} automatically assigns an IP address for the new host.
. Ensure that the *MAC address* field is blank. The {OpenStack} server assigns a MAC address to the host.
. Verify that {ProjectServer} automatically selects the *Managed*, *Primary*, and *Provision* options for the first interface on the host. If not, select them.
. Click the *Operating System* tab, and confirm that each aspect of the operating system is populated.
. If you want to change the image that populates automatically from your compute profile, from the *Images* list, select a different image to base the new host's root volume.
. Click *Resolve* in *Provisioning Templates* to verify that the new host can identify the right provisioning templates to use.
. Click the *Virtual Machine* tab, and verify that the settings are populated with details from the host groups and compute profile. Modify these settings to suit your needs.
ifeval::["{build}" == "satellite"]
. Click the *Parameters* tab and ensure that a parameter exists that provides an activation key. If not, add an activation key.
endif::[]
ifeval::["{build}" == "foreman"]
. If you use the Katello plugin, click the *Parameters* tab and ensure that a parameter exists that provides an activation key. If not, add an activation key.
endif::[]
. Click *Submit* to save the changes.

This new host entry triggers the {OpenStack} server to create the instance, using the pre-existing image as a basis for the new volume.

.For CLI Users

Create the host with the `hammer host create` command and include the `--provision-method image` option to use image-based provisioning.

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer host create --name "openstack-test1" --organization "_My_Organization_" \
--location "New York" --hostgroup "_Example_Hostgroup_" \
--compute-resource "_My_OpenStack_Platform_" --provision-method image \
--image "Test OpenStack Image" --enabled true --managed true \
--interface "managed=true,primary=true,provision=true" \

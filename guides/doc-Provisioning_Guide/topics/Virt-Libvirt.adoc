[[Provisioning_Virtual_Machines_in_KVM]]
== Provisioning Virtual Machines on a KVM Server (libvirt)

Kernel-based Virtual Machines (KVMs) use an open source virtualization daemon and API called `libvirt` running on Red Hat Enterprise Linux. {ProjectNameX} can connect to the `libvirt` API on a KVM server, provision hosts on the hypervisor, and control certain virtualization functions.

[[Provisioning_Virtual_Machines_in_KVM-Prerequisites_for_KVM_Provisioning]]
=== Prerequisites for KVM Provisioning

The requirements for KVM provisioning include:

   * A {SmartProxyServer} managing a network on the KVM server. Ensure no other DHCP services run on this network to avoid conflicts with the {SmartProxyServer}. For more information about network service configuration for {SmartProxyServer}s, see xref:Configuring_Networking[].
   * A {RHEL} server running KVM virtualization tools (libvirt daemon). For more information, see the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Virtualization_Getting_Started_Guide/index.html[Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Virtualization Getting Started Guide].
ifeval::["{build}" == "foreman"]
   * A server running KVM virtualization tools (libvirt daemon).
   * Virtual network running on the libvirt server. Only NAT and isolated virtual networks can be managed through {Project}.
endif::[]
   * An existing virtual machine image if you want to use image-based provisioning. Ensure that this image exists in a storage pool on the KVM host. The `default` storage pool is usually located in `/var/lib/libvirt/images`. Only directory pool storage types can be managed through {Project}.

[[Povisioning_Virtual_Machines_in_KVM-Configuring_the_Satellite_Server_for_KVM_Connections]]
=== Configuring {ProjectServer} for KVM Connections

Before adding the KVM connection, {ProjectServer} requires some configuration to ensure a secure connection. This means creating an SSH key pair for the user that performs the connection, which is the `foreman` user.

.Non-root users

These examples use the root user for KVM. However, if you want to use a non-root user on the KVM server, add the user to the `libvirt` group on the KVM server:
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
useradd -a -G libvirt _non_root_user_
----

.Procedure

To configure {ProjectServer} for KVM connections, complete the following steps:

. On {ProjectServer}, switch to the `foreman` user:
+
----
# su foreman -s /bin/bash
----

. Generate the key pair:
+
----
$ ssh-keygen
----

. Copy the public key to the KVM server:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
$ ssh-copy-id _root@kvm.example.com_
----

. Exit the bash shell for the `foreman` user:
+
----
$ exit
----

. Install the `libvirt-client` package:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# {packages-install} libvirt-client
----
+
. Use the following command to test the connection to the KVM server:
+
[options="nowrap"]
----
# su foreman -s /bin/bash -c 'virsh -c qemu+ssh://root@kvm.example.com/system list'
----
+
When you add the KVM connection in {ProjectServer}, use the `qemu+ssh` protocol and the address to the server. For example:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
qemu+ssh://root@_kvm.example.com_/system
----

[[Provisioning_Virtual_Machines_in_KVM-Creating_Hosts_on_a_KVM_Server]]
=== Creating Hosts on a KVM Server

In {Project}, you can use KVM provisioning to create hosts over a network connection and from an existing image.

If you want to create a host over a network connection, the new host must have access either to {ProjectServer}'s integrated {SmartProxy} or an external {SmartProxyServer} on a KVM virtual network, so that the host has access to PXE provisioning services. This new host entry triggers the KVM server to create and start a virtual machine. If the virtual machine detects the defined {SmartProxyServer} through the virtual network, the virtual machine boots to PXE and begins to install the chosen operating system.

If you create a host with an existing image, the new host entry triggers the KVM server to create the virtual machine, using the pre-existing image as a basis for the new volume.

.DHCP Conflicts
For network-based provisioning, if you use a virtual network on the KVM server for provisioning, select a network that does not provide DHCP assignments. This causes DHCP conflicts with {ProjectServer} when booting new hosts.

.Procedure

To create a KVM host, complete the following steps:

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Hosts* > *Create Host*.
. In the *Name* field, enter the name that you want to become the provisioned system's host name.
. Click the *Organization* and *Location* tabs to ensure that the provisioning context is automatically set to the current context.
. From the *Host Group* list, select the host group that you want to use to populate the form.
. From the *Deploy on* list, select the KVM connection.
. From the *Compute Profile* list, select a profile to use to automatically populate virtual machine-based settings.
. Click the *Interface* tab and click *Edit* on the host's interface.
. Verify that the fields are automatically populated with values. Note in particular:
+
  * The *Name* from the *Host* tab becomes the *DNS name*.
  * {ProjectServer} automatically assigns an IP address for the new host.
+
. Ensure that the *MAC address* field is blank. The KVM server assigns one to the host.
. Verify that the *Managed*, *Primary*, and *Provision* options are automatically selected for the first interface on the host. If not, select them.
. In the interface window, review the KVM-specific fields that are populated with settings from your compute profile. Modify these settings to suit your needs.
. Click the *Operating System* tab, and confirm that all fields automatically contain values.
. For network-based provisioning, ensure that the *Provisioning Method* is set to `Network Based`. For image-based provisioning, ensure that the *Provisioning Method* is set to `Image Based`
. Click *Resolve* in *Provisioning templates* to check the new host can identify the right provisioning templates to use.
. Click the *Virtual Machine* tab and confirm that these settings are populated with details from the host group and compute profile. Modify these settings to suit your needs.
ifeval::["{Build}" == "foreman"]
. If you use the Katello plugin, click the *Parameters* tab, and ensure that a parameter exists that provides an activation key. If not, add an activation key.

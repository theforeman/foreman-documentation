== Provisioning Virtual Machines with {KubeVirt}

{KubeVirt} addresses the needs of development teams that have adopted or want to adopt Kubernetes but possess existing virtual machine (VM)-based workloads that cannot be easily containerized. This technology provides a unified development platform where developers can build, modify, and deploy applications residing in application containers and VMs in a shared environment. These capabilities support rapid application modernization across the open hybrid cloud.

With {ProjectNameX}, you can create a compute resource for {KubeVirt} so that you can provision and manage Kubernetes virtual machines using {Project}.

====
The {KubeVirt} compute resource is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are
not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be
functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production.
These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling
customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.
For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features,
see https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/.

=== Prerequisites for {KubeVirt} Provisioning

* A {KubeVirt} user that has the `cluster-admin` permissions for the Openshift Container Platform virtual cluster. For more information, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.1/html/authentication/using-rbac[Using RBAC to Define and Apply Permissions] in the _Authentication_ guide of the Openshift Container Platform documentation.
* A {SmartProxyServer} managing a network on the {KubeVirt} server. Ensure that no other DHCP services run on this network to avoid conflicts with {SmartProxyServer}. For more information about network service configuration for {SmartProxyServer}s, see xref:Configuring_Networking[].
ifeval::["{build}" == "satellite"]
* Synchronized content repositories for the version of {RHEL} that you want to provision. For more information, see {BaseURL}content_management_guide/importing_red_hat_content#Importing_Red_Hat_Content-Synchronizing_Red_Hat_Repositories[Synchronizing Red Hat Repositories] in the Content Management Guide.
* An activation key for host registration. For more information, see {BaseURL}content_management_guide/managing_activation_keys#Managing_Activation_Keys-Creating_an_Activation_Key[Creating An Activation Key] in the _Content Management_ guide.

* If the Katello plugin is installed, synchronized content repositories for the version of {RHEL} that you want to provision. For more information, see {BaseURL}content_management_guide/importing_red_hat_content#Importing_Red_Hat_Content-Synchronizing_Red_Hat_Repositories[Synchronizing Red Hat Repositories] in the Content Management Guide.
* If the Katello plugin is installed, an activation key for host registration. For more information, see {BaseURL}content_management_guide/managing_activation_keys#Managing_Activation_Keys-Creating_an_Activation_Key[Creating An Activation Key] in the _Content Management_ guide.

.Enabling the {KubeVirt} plugin for {Project}

To enable the {KubeVirt} plugin for {Project}, you must run the `{foreman-installer}` command with the following option:

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-installer} --enable-foreman-plugin-kubevirt
----

.User Roles and Permissions to Provision using {KubeVirt}

To provision a {KubeVirt} virtual machine in {Project}, you must have a user account with the following roles:

* `Edit hosts`
* `View hosts`

For more information, see {BaseURL}administering_red_hat_satellite/chap-red_hat_satellite-administering_red_hat_satellite-users_and_roles#sect-{Project_Link}-Administering_{Project_Link}-Creating_and_Managing_Users-Assigning_Roles_to_a_User[Assigning Roles to a User] in the _Administering {ProjectName}_ guide.

You must also create a custom role with the following permissions:

* `view_compute_resources`
* `destroy_compute_resources_vms`
* `power_compute_resources_vms`
* `create_compute_resources_vms`
* `view_compute_resources_vms`
* `view_locations`
* `view_subnets`

.Bearer token authentication

Before you can create a {KubeVirt} compute resource, you must generate a bearer token to use for HTTP and HTTPs authentication.

. On your {KubeVirt} server, to list the secrets that contain tokens, enter the following command:
+
----
# kubectl get secrets
----
. To list the token for your secret, enter the following command:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# kubectl get secrets _YOUR_SECRET_ -o jsonpath='{.data.token}' | base64 -d | xargs
----

=== Adding a {KubeVirt} Connection to {ProjectServer}

Use this procedure to add a {KubeVirt} connection to {ProjectServer}'s compute resources.

.Procedure

To add a {KubeVirt} connection to {Project}, complete the following steps:

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Infrastructure* > *Compute Resources*, and click *Create Compute Resource*.
. In the *Name* field, enter a name for the new compute resource.
. From the *Provider* list, select *{KubeVirt}*.
. In the *Description* field, enter a description for the compute resource.
. In the *Hostname* field, enter the address of the {KubeVirt} server that you want to use.
. In the *API Port* field, enter the port number that you want to use for provisioning requests from {Project} to {KubeVirt}.
. In the *Namespace* field, enter the user name of the {KubeVirt} virtual cluster that you want to use.
. In the *Token* field, enter a bearer token for HTTP and HTTPs authentication.
. Optional: In the *X509 Certification Authorities* field, enter a certifcate to enable client certificate authentication for API server calls.

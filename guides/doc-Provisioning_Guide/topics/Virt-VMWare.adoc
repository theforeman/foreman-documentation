== Provisioning Virtual Machines in VMware vSphere

VMware vSphere is an enterprise-level virtualization platform from VMware.
{ProjectNameX} can interact with the vSphere platform, including creating new virtual machines and controlling their power management states.

[[Provisioning_Virtual_Machines_in_VMware_vSphere-Prerequisites_for_VMware_vSphere_Provisioning]]
=== Prerequisites for VMware vSphere Provisioning

The requirements for VMware vSphere provisioning include:

* A {SmartProxyServer} managing a network on the vSphere environment.
Ensure no other DHCP services run on this network to avoid conflicts with the {SmartProxyServer}.
For more information, see xref:Configuring_Networking[].
* An existing VMware template if you want to use image-based provisioning.

[[Provisioning_Virtual_Machines_in_VMware_vSphere-Creating_a_VMware_vSphere_User]]
=== Creating a VMware vSphere User

The VMware vSphere server requires an administration-like user for {ProjectServer} communication.
For security reasons, do not use the `administrator` user for such communication.
Instead, create a user with the following permissions:

For VMware vCenter Server version {ProductVersion}, set the following permissions:

    - All Privileges -> Datastore -> Allocate Space, Browse datastore, Update Virtual Machine files, Low level file operations
    - All Privileges -> Network -> Assign Network
    - All Privileges -> Resource -> Assign virtual machine to resource pool
    - All Privileges -> Virtual Machine -> Change Config (All)
    - All Privileges -> Virtual Machine -> Interaction (All)
    - All Privileges -> Virtual Machine -> Edit Inventory (All)
    - All Privileges -> Virtual Machine -> Provisioning (All)

For VMware vCenter Server version 6.5, set the following permissions:

    - All Privileges -> Datastore -> Allocate Space, Browse datastore, Update Virtual Machine files, Low level file operations
    - All Privileges -> Network -> Assign Network
    - All Privileges -> Resource -> Assign virtual machine to resource pool
    - All Privileges -> Virtual Machine -> Configuration (All)
    - All Privileges -> Virtual Machine -> Interaction (All)
    - All Privileges -> Virtual Machine -> Inventory (All)
    - All Privileges -> Virtual Machine -> Provisioning (All)

[[Provisioning_Virtual_Machines_in_VMware_vSphere-Adding_a_VMware_vSphere_Connection_to_the_Satellite_Server]]
=== Adding a VMware vSphere Connection to {ProjectServer}

Use this procedure to add a VMware vSphere connection in {ProjectServer}'s compute resources.

Ensure that the host and network-based firewalls are configured to allow {Project} to vCenter communication on TCP port 443.
Verify that {Project} is able to resolve the host name of vCenter and vCenter is able to resolve {ProjectServer}'s host name.

.Procedure

To add a connection, complete the following steps:

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Infrastructure* > *Compute Resources*, and in the Compute Resources window, click *Create Compute Resource*.
. In the *Name* field, enter a name for the resource.
. From the *Provider* list, select *VMware*.
. In the *Description* field, enter a description for the resource.
. In the *VCenter/Server* field, enter the IP address or host name of the vCenter server.
. In the *User* field, enter the user name with permission to access the vCenter's resources.
. In the *Password* field, enter the password for the user.
. Click *Load Datacenters* to populate the list of data centers from your VMware vSphere environment.
. From the *Datacenter* list, select a specific data center to manage from this list.
. In the *Fingerprint* field, ensure that this field is populated with the fingerprint from the data center.
. From the *Display Type* list, select a console type, for example, *VNC* or *VMRC*.
Note that VNC consoles are unsupported on VMware ESXi 6.5 and later.
. Optional: In the *VNC Console Passwords* field, select the *Set a randomly generated password on the display connection* check box to secure console access for new hosts with a randomly generated password.
You can retrieve the password for the VNC console to access guest virtual machine console from the `libvirtd` host from the output of the following command:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# virsh edit _your_VM_name_
<graphics type='vnc' port='-1' autoport='yes' listen='0.0.0.0' passwd='_your_randomly_generated_password_'>
----
+
The password randomly generates every time the console for the virtual machine opens, for example, with virt-manager.
. From the *Enable Caching* list, you can select whether to enable caching of compute resources.
For more information, see xref:Provisioning_Virtual_Machines_in_VMware_vSphere-Caching_of_Compute_resources[].

[[Provisioning_Virtual_Machines_in_VMware_vSphere-Creating_Hosts_on_a_VMware_vSphere_Server]]
=== Creating Hosts on a VMware vSphere Server

The VMware vSphere provisioning process provides the option to create hosts over a network connection or using an existing image.

For network-based provisioning, you must create a host to access either {ProjectServer}'s integrated {SmartProxy} or an external {SmartProxyServer} on a VMware vSphere virtual network, so that the host has access to PXE provisioning services.
The new host entry triggers the VMware vSphere server to create the virtual machine.
If the virtual machine detects the defined {SmartProxyServer} through the virtual network, the virtual machine boots to PXE and begins to install the chosen operating system.

.DHCP Conflicts
If you use a virtual network on the VMware vSphere server for provisioning, ensure that you select a virtual network that does not provide DHCP assignments.
This causes DHCP conflicts with {ProjectServer} when booting new hosts.

For image-based provisioning, use the pre-existing image as a basis for the new volume.

.Procedure

To create a host for a VMware vSphere server, complete the following steps:

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Hosts* > *Create Host*.
. In the *Name* field, enter the name that you want to become the provisioned system's host name.
. Click the *Organization* and *Location* tabs to ensure that the provisioning context is automatically set to the current context.
. From the *Host Group* list, select the host group that you want to use to populate the form.
. From the *Deploy on* list, select the VMware vSphere connection.
. From the *Compute Profile* list, select a profile to use to automatically populate virtual machine-based settings.
. Click the *Interface* tab and click *Edit* on the host's interface.
. Verify that the fields are automatically populated with values.
Note in particular:
+
  * The *Name* from the *Host* tab becomes the *DNS name*.
  * The {ProjectServer} automatically assigns an IP address for the new host.
+
. Ensure that the *MAC address* field is blank.
The VMware vSphere server assigns one to the host.
. Verify that the *Managed*, *Primary*, and *Provision* options are automatically selected for the first interface on the host.
If not, select them.
. In the interface window, review the VMware vSphere-specific fields that are populated with settings from our compute profile.
Modify these settings to suit your needs.
. Click the *Operating System* tab, and confirm that all fields automatically contain values.
. Select the Provisioning Method that you want:
+
* For network-based provisioning, click *Network Based*.
* For image-based provisioning, click *Image Based*.
ifeval::["{build}" == "satellite"]
* For boot-disk provisioning, click *Boot disk based*.
endif::[]
ifeval::["{build}" != "satellite"]
* If the `foreman_bootdisk` plug-in is installed, and you want to use boot-disk provisioning, click *Boot disk based*.
endif::[]
+
. Click *Resolve* in *Provisioning templates* to check the new host can identify the right provisioning templates to use.
. Click the *Virtual Machine* tab and confirm that these settings are populated with details from the host group and compute profile.
Modify these settings to suit your requirements.
ifeval::["{build}" == "satellite"]
. Click the *Parameters* tab and ensure that a parameter exists that provides an activation key.
If not, add an activation key.
endif::[]
ifeval::["{build}" == "foreman-el"]
. If you use the Katello plugin, click the *Parameters* tab and ensure that a parameter exists that provides an activation key.
If not, add an activation key.
endif::[]
. Click *Submit* to save the host entry.

.For CLI Users

Create the host from a network with the `hammer host create` command and include `--provision-method build` to use network-based provisioning.

[[Provisioning_Virtual_Machines_in_VMware_vSphere-Provisioning_with_cloudinit_and_userdata_templates]]
=== Using the VMware vSphere Cloud-init and Userdata Templates for Provisioning

You can use VMware with the `Cloud-init` and `Userdata` templates to insert user data into the new virtual machine, to make further VMware customization, and to enable the VMware-hosted virtual machine to call back to {Project}.

You can use the same procedures to set up a VMware compute resource within {Project}, with a few modifications to the work flow.

.VMware cloud-init Provisioning Overview

ifeval::["{build}" == "satellite"]
image:user-data-sequence-satellite.png[]
endif::[]
ifeval::["{build}" != "satellite"]
image:user-data-sequence-foreman.svg[]
endif::[]

When you set up the compute resource and images for VMware provisioning in {Project}, the following sequence of provisioning events occur:

* The user provisions one or more virtual machines using the {Project} web UI, API, or hammer
* {Project} calls the VMware vCenter to clone the virtual machine template
* {Project} `userdata` provisioning template adds customized identity information
* When provisioning completes, the `Cloud-init` provisioning template instructs the virtual machine to call back to {SmartProxy} when `cloud-init` runs
* VMware vCenter clones the template to the virtual machine
* VMware vCenter applies customization for the virtual machine's identity, including the host name, IP, and DNS
* The virtual machine builds, `cloud-init` is invoked and calls back {Project} on port `80`, which then redirects to `443`

.Port and Firewall Requirements

Because of the `cloud-init` service, the virtual machine always calls back to {Project} even if you register the virtual machine to {SmartProxy}.
Ensure that you configure port and firewall settings to open any necessary connections.


For more information about port and firewall requirements, see {InstallingProjectDocURL}satellite-ports-and-firewalls-requirements_{project-context}[Port and Firewall Requirements] in the _Installing {Project}_ and {InstallingSmartProxyDocURL}capsule-ports-and-firewalls-requirements_{smart-proxy-context}[Ports and Firewalls Requirements] in _Installing {SmartProxyServer}_.

.Associating the `userdata` and `Cloud-init` Templates with the Operating System

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Hosts* > *Operating Systems*, and select the operating system that you want to use for provisioning.
. Click the *Template* tab.
. From the *Cloud-init template* list, select *Cloudinit default*.
. From the *User data template* list, select *UserData open-vm-tools*.
. Click *Submit* to save the changes.

.Preparing an Image to use the cloud-init Template

To prepare an image, you must first configure the settings that you require on a virtual machine that you can then save as an image to use in {Project}.

To use the `cloud-init` template for provisioning, you must configure a virtual machine so that `cloud-init` is installed, enabled, and configured to call back to {ProjectServer}.

For security purposes, you must install a CA certificate to use HTTPs for all communication.
This procedure includes steps to clean the virtual machine so that no unwanted information transfers to the image you use for provisioning.

If you have an image with `cloud-init`, you must still follow this procedure to enable `cloud-init` to communicate with {Project} because `cloud-init` is disabled by default.

ifeval::["{build}" != "satellite"]
These instructions are for Red Hat Enterprise Linux or Fedora OS, follow similar steps for other Linux distributions.
endif::[]

. On the virtual machine that you use to create the image, install `cloud-init`, `open-vm-tools`, and `perl`:
+
----
# yum -y install cloud-init open-vm-tools perl
----
+
. Create a configuration file for `cloud-init`:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# vi /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/_example_cloud-init_config_.cfg
----
+
. Add the following information to the `_example_cloud_init_config_.cfg` file:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
datasource_list: [NoCloud]
datasource:
  NoCloud:
    seedfrom: https://{foreman-example-com}/userdata/
EOF
----
+
. Enable the CA certificates for the image:
+
----
# update-ca-trust enable
----
+
. Download the `katello-server-ca.crt` file from {ProjectServer}:
ifeval::["{build}" == "foreman-el"]
You must have the Katello plugin installed to complete this step.
For {ProjectServer} deployments, copy the CA certificate from the Apache configuration.
endif::[]
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# wget -O /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/cloud-init-ca.crt http://_{foreman-example-com}_/pub/katello-server-ca.crt
----
+
. To update the record of certificates, enter the following command:
+
----
# update-ca-trust extract
----
. Use the following commands to clean the image:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# systemctl stop rsyslog
# systemctl stop auditd
# package-cleanup -oldkernels -count=1
# {package-clean} all
----
+
. Use the following commands to reduce logspace, remove old logs, and truncate logs:
+
----
# logrotate -f /etc/logrotate.conf
# rm -f /var/log/*-???????? /var/log/*.gz
# rm -f /var/log/dmesg.old
# rm -rf /var/log/anaconda

# cat /dev/null > /var/log/wtmp
# cat /dev/null > /var/log/lastlog
# cat /dev/null > /var/log/grubby
----
+
. Remove `udev` hardware rules:
+
----
# rm -f /etc/udev/rules.d/70*
----
+
. Remove the `uuid` from `ifcfg` scripts:
+
----
# cat > /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-ens192 <<EOM
DEVICE=ens192
ONBOOT=yes
EOM
----
+
. Remove the SSH host keys:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# rm -f /etc/ssh/_SSH_keys_
----
+
. Remove root user's shell history:
+
----
# rm -f ~root/.bash_history
# unset HISTFILE
----
+
. Remove root user's SSH history:
+
----
# rm -rf ~root/.ssh/known_hosts
----

You can now create an image from this virtual machine.

You can use the xref:Provisioning_Virtual_Machines_in_VMware_vSphere-Adding_VMware_vSphere_Images_on_the_Satellite_Server[] section to add the image to {Project}.

.Configuring {SmartProxy} to Forward the user data Template

If you deploy {Project} with the {SmartProxy} templates feature, you must configure {Project} to recognize hosts' IP addresses forwarded over the X-Forwarded-For HTTP header to serve correct template payload.

For security reasons, {Project} recognizes this HTTP header only from localhost.
For each individual {SmartProxy}, you must configure a regular expression to recognize hosts' IP addresses.
From the web UI, you can do this by navigating to *Administer* > *Settings* > *Provisioning*, and changing the *Remote address* setting.
From the CLI, you can do this by entering the following command:

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# hammer settings set --name remote_addr --value '(localhost(4|6|4to6)?|192.168.122.(1|2|3))'

= Registering a Host to {ProjectName}

Use the following procedure to register a host to {ProjectNameX}.

.Prerequisites

* {ProjectServer}, any {SmartProxyServer}s, and all hosts must be synchronized with the same NTP server, and have a time synchronization tool enabled and running.
* The daemon *rhsmcertd* must be running on the hosts.
* An activation key must be available for the host. For more information, see {BaseURL}content_management_guide/managing_activation_keys[Managing Activation Keys] in the _Content Management Guide_.
* Subscription Manager must be version 1.10 or later. The package is available in the standard Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise Linux repository.

.Procedure

Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise{nbsp}Linux hosts register to the Red{nbsp}Hat Content Delivery Network by default.

Update each host configuration so that they receive updates from the correct {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer}:

. Note the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer}, for example _server.example.com_.
. Log in to the host as the `root` user and download the `katello-ca-consumer-latest.noarch.rpm` package from {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer} to which the host is to be registered. The consumer RPM configures the host to download content from the content source that is specified in {ProjectName}.

----
# curl --insecure --output katello-ca-consumer-latest.noarch.rpm https://_{foreman-example-com}_/pub/katello-ca-consumer-latest.noarch.rpm
----
+
. Install the `katello-ca-consumer-latest.noarch.rpm` package:
+
----
# yum localinstall katello-ca-consumer-latest.noarch.rpm
----
+
NOTE: The RPM package is not signed. If required, you can add the `--nosignature` option to install the package. The `katello-ca-consumer-_hostname_-1.0-1.noarch.rpm` package is an additional `katello-ca-consumer` RPM that contains the server's host name. The `katello-ca-consumer-latest.noarch.rpm` package always reflects the most recent version. Both serve the same purpose.

. Clear any old host data related to Red{nbsp}Hat Subscription Manager (RHSM):
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# subscription-manager clean
----
+
. Register the host using RHSM:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# subscription-manager register --org=_your_org_name_ \
--activationkey=_your_activation_key_
----
+
.Command Output after Registration:
====
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# subscription-manager register --org=MyOrg --activationkey=TestKey-1
The system has been registered with id: 62edc0f8-855b-4184-b1b8-72a9dc793b96
----
====

[NOTE]
====
You can use the `--environment` option to override the Content View and life cycle environment defined by the activation key. For example, to register a host to the Content View "MyView" in a "Development" life cycle environment:

[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
 # subscription-manager register --org=_your_org_name_ \
 --environment=Development/MyView \
 --activationkey=_your_activation_key_
----
====

[NOTE]
====
For Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise Linux 6.3 hosts, the release version defaults to Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise{nbsp}Linux{nbsp}6 Server and needs to be pointed to the 6.3 repository:

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Hosts* > *Content Hosts*.
. Select the check box next to the host that needs to be changed.
. From the *Select Action* list, select *Set Release Version*
. From the *Release Version* list, select *6.3*.
. Click *Done*.

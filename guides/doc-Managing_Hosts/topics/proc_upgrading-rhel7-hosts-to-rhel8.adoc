* Enable remote execution feature on {Project}.
For more information, see xref:configuring-and-setting-up-remote-jobs_{context}[].
* Distribute {Project} SSH keys to the hosts that you want to upgrade.

.Procedure
. On {Project}, enable the `foreman_plugin_leapp` puppet module:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-installer} --enable-foreman-plugin-leapp
----
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Hosts* > *All Hosts*.
. Select the hosts that you want to upgrade to Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise{nbsp}Linux 8.
. In the upper right of the Hosts window, from the *Select Action* list, select *Preupgrade check with Leapp*.
. Click *Submit* to start the pre-upgrade check.
. When the check is finished, click the *Leapp preupgrade report* tab to see if LEAPP has found any issues on RHEL 7 hosts.
Issues that have the *Inhibitor* flag are considered crucial and are likely to break the upgrade procedure.
Issues that have the *Has Remediation* flag contain remediation that can help you fix the issue.
.. Click an issue that is flagged as *Has Remediation* to expand it.

* If the issue contains a remediation *Command*, you can fix it directly from {Project} using remote execution.
Select the issue.
* If the issue contains only a remediation *Hint*, use the hint to fix the issue on the host manually.

+
+
Repeat this step for other issues.
.. After you selected any issues with remediation commands, click *Fix Selected* and submit the job.
.. After the issues are fixed, click the *Rerun* button, and then click *Submit* to run the pre-upgrade check again to verify that the hosts you are upgrading do not have any issues and are ready to be upgraded.
. When your systems are ready for the upgrade, click the *Run Upgrade* button and click *Submit* to start the upgrade.

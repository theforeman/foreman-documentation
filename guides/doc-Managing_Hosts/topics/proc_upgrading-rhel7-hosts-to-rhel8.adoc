= Upgrading Hosts from RHEL 7 to RHEL 8

You can use a job template to upgrade your Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise{nbsp}Linux 7 hosts to Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise{nbsp}Linux 8.

.Prerequisites

* Ensure that your RHEL 7 hosts meet the requirements for the upgrade to RHEL 8. For more information, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/upgrading_from_rhel_7_to_rhel_8/planning-an-upgrade_upgrading-from-rhel-7-to-rhel-8[Planning an upgrade] in the _Upgrading from RHEL 7 to RHEL 8_ guide.
* Prepare your hosts for the upgrade. For more information, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/upgrading_from_rhel_7_to_rhel_8/preparing-a-rhel-7-system-for-the-upgrade_upgrading-from-rhel-7-to-rhel-8[Preparing a RHEL 7 system for the upgrade] in the _Upgrading from RHEL 7 to RHEL 8_ guide.
* Enable remote execution feature on {Project}. For more information, see xref:configuring-and-setting-up-remote-jobs_{context}[].
* Distribute {Project} SSH keys to the hosts that you want to upgrade. For more information, see xref:ssh-keys-for-remote-execution-overview_{context}[].

.Procedure

. On {Project}, enable the `foreman_plugin_leapp` puppet module:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-installer} --enable-foreman-plugin-leapp
----
. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Hosts* > *All Hosts*.
. Select the hosts that you want to upgrade to Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise{nbsp}Linux 8.
. In the upper right of the Hosts window, from the *Select Action* list, select *Preupgrade check with Leapp*.
. Click *Submit* to start the pre-upgrade check.
. When the check is finished, click the *Leapp preupgrade report* tab to see if LEAPP has found any issues on RHEL 7 hosts. Issues that have the *Inhibitor* flag are considered crucial and are likely to break the upgrade procedure. Some issues might have documentation linked that describe how to fix them.
. Optional: If you have issues that have commands associated with them, you can fix them with a remote job. To do that, select these issues, click the *Fix Selected* button, and submit the job.
. After you fixed the issues, click the *Rerun* button, and then click *Submit* to run the pre-upgrade check again to verify that your RHEL 7 hosts do not have any issues and are ready to be upgraded.
. When your systems are ready for the upgrade, click the *Run Upgrade* button and click submit to start the upgrade.

= Overview of Hosts in {ProjectNameX}

A host is any Linux client that {ProjectName} manages. Hosts can be physical or virtual. Virtual hosts can be deployed on any platform supported by {ProjectName}, such as KVM, VMware vSphere, OpenStack, Amazon EC2, Rackspace Cloud Services or Google Compute Engine.

{ProjectName} enables host management at scale, including monitoring, provisioning, remote execution, configuration management, software management, and subscription management. You can manage your hosts from the {Project} web UI or from the command line.

In the {Project} web UI, you can browse all hosts recognized by {ProjectServer}, grouped by type:

* *All Hosts* - a list of all hosts recognized by {ProjectServer}.
* *Discovered Hosts* - a list of bare-metal hosts detected on the provisioning network by the Discovery plug-in.
* *Content Hosts* - a list of hosts that manage tasks related to content and subscriptions.
* *Host Collections* - a list of user-defined collections of hosts used for bulk actions such as errata installation.

To search for a host, type in the *Search* field, and use an asterisk ({asterisk}) to perform a partial string search. For example, if searching for a content host named `dev-node.example.com`, click the *Content Hosts* page and type `dev-node*` in the *Search* field. Alternatively, `{asterisk}node{asterisk}` will also find the content host `dev-node.example.com.`

WARNING: {ProjectServer} is listed as a host itself even if it is not self-registered. Do not delete {ProjectServer} from the list of hosts.

= Adding a Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) Interface

Use this procedure to configure a baseboard management controller (BMC) interface for a host that supports this feature.

.Prerequisites

* The `ipmitool` package is installed.
* You know the MAC address, IP address, and other details of the BMC interface on the host, and the appropriate credentials for that interface.
+
[NOTE]
====
You only need the MAC address for the BMC interface if the BMC interface is managed, so that it can create a DHCP reservation.
====

.Procedure

. Enable BMC on the {SmartProxy} server if it is not already enabled:
.. Configure BMC power management on the {SmartProxyServer} by running the `{foreman-installer}` script with the following options:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-installer} --foreman-proxy-bmc=true \
--foreman-proxy-bmc-default-provider=ipmitool
----

.. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Infrastructure* > *{SmartProxies}*.
.. From the list in the *Actions* column, click *Refresh*. The list in the *Features* column should now include BMC.

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Hosts* > *All hosts*.
. Click *Edit* next to the host you want to edit.
. On the *Interfaces* tab, click *Add Interface*.
. Select *BMC* from the *Type* list. Type-specific configuration options are appended to the form.
. Specify the general interface settings. The applicable configuration options are the same as for the physical interfaces described in xref:adding-a-physical-interface[].
. Specify the configuration options specific to BMC interfaces:

* *Username* and *Password*: Specify any authentication credentials required by BMC.

* *Provider*: Specify the BMC provider.

. Click *OK* to save the interface configuration.
. Click *Submit* to apply the changes to the host.

You can access the {Cockpit} web UI through the {Project} web UI and use the functionality to manage and monitor hosts in {Project}.

.Prerequisites

* {Cockpit} is enabled in {Project}.
* {Cockpit} is installed on the host that you want to view:

ifeval::["{build}" != "satellite"]
** For more information see https://cockpit-project.org/running.html[Running Cockpit].
endif::[]

ifeval::["{build}" == "satellite"]
** For Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise Linux 8, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/managing_systems_using_the_rhel_8_web_console/getting-started-with-the-rhel-8-web-console_system-management-using-the-rhel-8-web-console#installing-the-web-console_getting-started-with-the-rhel-8-web-console[Installing the web console] in the _Managing systems using the RHEL 8 web console_ guide.

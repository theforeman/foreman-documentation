= Registering Hosts

There are two main methods for registering a host to {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer}:

* Download and install the consumer RPM (_server.example.com_/pub/katello-ca-consumer-latest.noarch.rpm) and then run Subscription Manager. This method is suited for freshly installed hosts.

* Download and run the bootstrap script (_server.example.com_/pub/bootstrap.py). This method is suited for both freshly installed hosts and hosts that have been previously registered, for example, to {Project} 5 or another {ProjectX}.

You can also register Atomic Hosts to {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer}.

Use one of the following procedures to register a host:

* xref:registering-a-host-to-satellite-using-the-bootstrap-script[]

* xref:installing-the-katello-agent_managing-hosts[]
* xref:installing-tracer[]
* xref:installing-and-configuring-the-puppet-agent[]

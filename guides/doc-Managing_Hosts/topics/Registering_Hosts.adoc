= Registering Hosts

There are three main methods for registering hosts to {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer}:

. *(Default method)* Generate a `curl` command from {Project} and run this command from unlimited number of hosts to register them using the global registration template.
This method is suited for hosts that haven't been registered to {Project} yet.
+
By using this method you can also deploy {Project} SSH keys to hosts during registration to {Project} to enable hosts for remote execution jobs.
For more information about the remote execution jobs, see {ManagingHostsDocURL}configuring-and-setting-up-remote-jobs_managing-hosts[Configuring and Setting up Remote Jobs].
+
By using this method you can also configure hosts with Red{nbsp}Hat Insights during registration to {Project}.
For more information about using Insights with {Project} hosts, see {ManagingHostsDocURL}Using_Red_Hat_Insights_with_Hosts_managing-hosts[Monitoring Hosts Using Red{nbsp}Hat Insights].

. *(Deprecated)* Download and install the consumer RPM `_server.example.com_/pub/katello-ca-consumer-latest.noarch.rpm` and then run Subscription Manager.
This method is suited for hosts that haven't been provisioned through {Project}.

. *(Deprecated)* Download and run the bootstrap script (_server.example.com_/pub/bootstrap.py).
This method is suited for hosts that haven't been provisioned through {Project}.

You can also register Atomic Hosts to {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer}.

Use one of the following procedures to register a host:

* xref:registering-a-host_{context}[]
* xref:Registering_an_Atomic_Host_{context}[]
* xref:Registering_a_Host_Using_the_Bootstrap_Script_{context}[]

Use the following procedures to install and configure host tools:

* xref:Installing_the_Katello_Agent_{context}[]
* xref:installing-tracer[]
* xref:Installing_and_Configuring_the_Puppet_Agent_{context}[]

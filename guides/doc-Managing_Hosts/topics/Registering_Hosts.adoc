= Registering Hosts

There are three main methods for registering hosts to {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer}:

. Generate a `curl` command from {Project} and run this command from unlimited number of hosts to register them using the global registration template.
This method is suited for both freshly installed hosts and hosts that have been previously registered, for example, to {Project} 5 or another {ProjectX}.
+
By using this method you can also deploy {Project} SSH keys to hosts during registration to {Project} to enable hosts for remote execution jobs.
For more information about the remote execution jobs, see {ManagingHostsDocURL}configuring-and-setting-up-remote-jobs_managing-hosts[Configuring and Setting up Remote Jobs].
+
By using this method you can also configure hosts with Red{nbsp}Han Insights during registration to {Project}.
For more information about using Insights with {Project} hosts, see {ManagingHostsDocURL}using-insights-with-satellite-hosts[Monitoring Hosts Using Red Hat Insights].

. Download and install the consumer RPM `_server.example.com_/pub/katello-ca-consumer-latest.noarch.rpm` and then run Subscription Manager.
This method is suited for freshly installed hosts.

. Download and run the bootstrap script (_server.example.com_/pub/bootstrap.py).
This method is suited for both freshly installed hosts and hosts that have been previously registered, for example, to {Project} 5 or another {ProjectX}.

You can also register Atomic Hosts to {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer}.

Use one of the following procedures to register a host:

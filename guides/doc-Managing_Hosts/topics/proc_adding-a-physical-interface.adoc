= Adding a Physical Interface

Use this procedure to add an additional physical interface to a host.

.Procedure

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Hosts* > *All hosts*.
. Click *Edit* next to the host you want to edit.
. On the *Interfaces* tab, click *Add Interface*.
. Keep the *Interface* option selected in the *Type* list.
. Specify a *MAC address*. This setting is required.
. Specify the *Device Identifier*, for example *eth0*. The identifier is used to specify this physical interface when creating bonded interfaces, VLANs, and aliases.
. Specify the *DNS name* associated with the host's IP address. {Project} saves this name in the {SmartProxyServer} associated with the selected domain (the "DNS A" field) and the {SmartProxyServer} associated with the selected subnet (the "DNS PTR" field). A single host can therefore have several DNS entries.
. Select a domain from the *Domain* list. To create and manage domains, navigate to *Infrastructure* > *Domains*.
. Select a subnet from the *Subnet* list. To create and manage subnets, navigate to *Infrastructure* > *Subnets*.
. Specify the *IP address*. Managed interfaces with an assigned DHCP {SmartProxyServer} require this setting for creating a DHCP lease. DHCP-enabled managed interfaces are automatically provided with a suggested IP address.
. Select whether the interface is *Managed*. If the interface is managed, configuration is pulled from the associated {SmartProxyServer} during provisioning, and DNS and DHCP entries are created. If using kickstart provisioning, a configuration file is automatically created for the interface.
. Select whether this is the *Primary* interface for the host. The DNS name from the primary interface is used as the host portion of the FQDN.
. Select whether this is the *Provision* interface for the host. TFTP boot takes place using the provisioning interface. For image-based provisioning, the script to complete the provisioning is executed through the provisioning interface.
. Select whether to use the interface for *Remote execution*.
. Leave the *Virtual NIC* check box clear.
. Click *OK* to save the interface configuration.
. Click *Submit* to apply the changes to the host.

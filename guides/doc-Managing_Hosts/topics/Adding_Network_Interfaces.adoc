= Adding Network Interfaces

{ProjectName} supports specifying multiple network interfaces for a single host. You can configure these interfaces when creating a new host as described in xref:creating-a-host-in-satellite[] or when editing an existing host.

There are several types of network interfaces that you can attach to a host. When adding a new interface, select one of:

* *Interface*: Allows you to specify an additional physical or virtual interface. There are two types of virtual interfaces you can create. Use *VLAN* when the host needs to communicate with several (virtual) networks using a single interface, while these networks are not accessible to each other. Use *alias* to add an additional IP address to an existing interface.

For more information about adding a physical interface, see xref:adding-a-physical-interface[].
+
For more information about adding a virtual interface, see xref:adding-a-virtual-interface[].

* *Bond*: Creates a bonded interface. NIC bonding is a way to bind multiple network interfaces together into a single interface that appears as a single device and has a single MAC address. This enables two or more network interfaces to act as one, increasing the bandwidth and providing redundancy. See xref:adding-a-bonded-interface[] for details.

* *BMC*: Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) allows you to remotely monitor and manage the physical state of machines. For more information about BMC, see link:{InstallingProjectDocURL}enabling-power-management-on-managed-hosts_{project-context}[Enabling Power Management on Managed Hosts] in _{project-installation-guide-title}_. For more information about configuring BMC interfaces, see xref:adding-a-bmc-interface[].

[NOTE]
====
Additional interfaces have the *Managed* flag enabled by default, which means the new interface is configured automatically during provisioning by the DNS and DHCP {SmartProxyServer}s associated with the selected subnet. This requires a subnet with correctly configured DNS and DHCP {SmartProxyServer}s. If you use a Kickstart method for host provisioning, configuration files are automatically created for managed interfaces in the post-installation phase at `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-_interface_id_`.

[NOTE]
====
Virtual and bonded interfaces currently require a MAC address of a physical device. Therefore, the configuration of these interfaces works only on bare-metal hosts.

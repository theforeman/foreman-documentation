= Adding a Bonded Interface

Use this procedure to configure a bonded interface for a host.

.Procedure

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Hosts* > *All hosts*.
. Click *Edit* next to the host you want to edit.
. On the *Interfaces* tab, click *Add Interface*.
. Select *Bond* from the *Type* list. Additional type-specific configuration options are appended to the form.
. Specify the general interface settings. The applicable configuration options are the same as for the physical interfaces described in xref:adding-a-physical-interface[].
+
Bonded interfaces use IDs in the form of *bond0* in the *Device Identifier* field.
+
A single *MAC address* is sufficient.
. Specify the configuration options specific to bonded interfaces:

* *Mode*: Select the bonding mode that defines a policy for fault tolerance and load balancing. See xref:Bonding_Modes_Available_in_{Project_Link}[] for a brief description of each bonding mode.

* *Attached devices*: Specify a comma-separated list of identifiers of attached devices. These can be physical interfaces or VLANs.

* *Bond options*: Specify a space-separated list of configuration options, for example *miimon=100*. See the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Networking_Guide/index.html[Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Networking Guide] for details of the configuration options you can specify for the bonded interface.

. Click *OK* to save the interface configuration.
. Click *Submit* to apply the changes to the host.

.For CLI Users

To create a host with a bonded interface, enter the following command:

|====
|Bonding Mode |Description
| balance-rr  | Transmissions are received and sent sequentially on each bonded interface.
| active-backup  | Transmissions are received and sent through the first available bonded interface. Another bonded interface is only used if the active bonded interface fails.
| balance-xor  | Transmissions are based on the selected hash policy. In this mode, traffic destined for specific peers is always sent over the same interface.
| broadcast  | All transmissions are sent on all bonded interfaces.
| 802.a3  | Creates aggregation groups that share the same settings. Transmits and receives on all interfaces in the active group.
| balance-tlb  | The outgoing traffic is distributed according to the current load on each bonded interface.
| balance-alb  | Receive load balancing is achieved through Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) negotiation.

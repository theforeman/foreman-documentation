== Integrating {ProjectName} and Ansible Tower

You can integrate {ProjectName}{nbsp}{ProductVersion} and Ansible Tower to use {ProjectServer} as a dynamic inventory source for Ansible Tower.

You can also use the provisioning callback function to run playbooks on hosts managed by {Project}, from either the host or Ansible Tower. When provisioning new hosts from {ProjectServer}, you can use the provisioning callback function to trigger playbook runs from Ansible Tower. The playbook configures the host following Kickstart deployment.

=== Adding {ProjectServer} to Ansible Tower as a Dynamic Inventory Item

To add {ProjectServer} to Ansible Tower as a dynamic inventory item, you must create a credential for a {ProjectServer} user on Ansible Tower, add an Ansible Tower user to the credential, and then configure an inventory source.

.Prerequisites

* If your {Project} deployment is large, for example, managing tens of thousands of hosts, using a non-admin user can negatively impact performance because of time penalties that accrue during authorization checks. For large deployments, consider using an admin user.
* For non-admin users, you must assign the `Ansible Tower Inventory Reader` role to your {ProjectServer} user. For more information about managing users, roles, and permission filters, see {BaseURL}administering_red_hat_satellite/chap-{Project_Link}-Administering_{Project_Link}-Users_and_Roles#sect-{Project_Link}-Administering_{Project_Link}-Users_and_Roles-Creating_and_Managing_Roles[Creating and Managing Roles] in _Administering {ProjectName}_.
* You must host your {ProjectServer} and Ansible Tower on the same network or subnet.

.Procedure

To add {ProjectServer} to Ansible Tower as a Dynamic Inventory Item, complete the following procedure:

. In the Ansible Tower web UI, create a credential for your {Project}. For more information about creating credentials, see http://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/userguide/credentials.html#add-a-new-credential[Add a New Credential] and http://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/userguide/credentials.html#red-hat-satellite-6[{ProjectNameX} Credentials] in the _Ansible Tower User Guide_.

[[sect-Red_Hat_Satellite-Managing_Hosts-Integrating_Satellite_and_Ansible_Tower-Configuring_Provisioning_Callback_for_a_Host]]
=== Configuring Provisioning Callback for a Host

When you create hosts in {Project}, you can use Ansible Tower to run playbooks to configure your newly created hosts. This is called _provisioning callback_ in Ansible Tower.

The provisioning callback function triggers a playbook run from Ansible Tower as part of the provisioning process. The playbook configures the host after Kickstart deployment.

For more information about provisioning callbacks, see http://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/userguide/job_templates.html#provisioning-callbacks[Provisioning Callbacks] in the _Ansible Tower User Guide_.

In {ProjectServer}, the `Kickstart Default` and `Kickstart Default Finish` templates include three snippets:

. `ansible_provisioning_callback`
. `ansible_tower_callback_script`
. `ansible_tower_callback_service`

You can add parameters to hosts or host groups to provide the credentials that these snippets can use to run Ansible playbooks on your newly created hosts.

.Prerequisites

Before you can configure provisioning callbacks, you must add {Project} as a dynamic inventory in Ansible Tower. For more information, see xref:chap-{Project_Link}-Managing_Hosts-Integrating_{Project}_and_Ansible_Tower[Integrating {Project} and Ansible Tower].

In the Ansible Tower web UI, you must complete the following tasks:

. Create a machine credential for your new host. Ensure that you enter the same password in the credential that you plan to assign to the host that you create in {Project}. For more information, see https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/userguide/credentials.html#add-a-new-credential[Add a New Credential] in the _Ansible Tower User Guide_.
. Create a project. For more information, see https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/userguide/projects.html[Projects] in the _Ansible Tower User Guide_.
. Add a job template to your project. For more information, see https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/userguide/job_templates.html#create-a-job-template[Job Templates] in the _Ansible Tower User Guide_.
. In your job template, you must enable provisioning callbacks, generate the host configuration key, and note the _template_ID_ of your job template. For more information about job templates, see http://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/userguide/job_templates.html#[Job Templates] in the _Ansible Tower User Guide_.

[[proc-Red_Hat_Satellite-Managing_Hosts-Integrating_Satellite_and_Ansible_Tower-To_Configure_Provisioning_Callback_for_a_Host]]
.Procedure

To configure provisioning callback for a new host in {Project}, complete the following steps:

. In the {ProjectName} web UI, navigate to *Configure* > *Host Group*.
. Create a host group or edit an existing host group.
. In the Host Group window, click the *Parameters* tab.
. Click *Add Parameter*.
. Enter the following information for each new parameter:
+
[[tabl-Red_Hat_Satellite-Managing_Hosts-Integrating_Satellite_and_Ansible_Tower-Host_Parameters]]
.Host Parameters
[cols="1a,1a,2a"options="header"]
|====
|Name |Value |Description
|`ansible_tower_provisioning` |true |Enables Provisioning Callback.
|`ansible_tower_fqdn` |_tower.example.com_ |The fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of your Ansible Tower. Do not add `https` because this is appended by Ansible Tower.
|`ansible_job_template_id` |_template_ID_ |The ID of your provisioning template that you can find in the URL of the template: `/templates/job_template/_5_`.
|`ansible_host_config_key` |_config_KEY_ |The host configuration key that your job template generates in Ansible Tower.
|====
+
. Click *Submit*.
. Create a host using the host group.
. On the new host, enter the following command to start the `ansible-callback` service:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# systemctl start ansible-callback
----
+
. On the new host, enter the following command to output the status of the `ansible-callback` service:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# systemctl status ansible-callback
----
+
Provisioning callback is configured correctly if the command returns the following output:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
SAT_host systemd[1]: Started Provisioning callback to Ansible Tower...
----

.Manual Provisioning Callback
You can use the provisioning callback URL and the host configuration key from a host to call Ansible Tower. For example:
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# curl -k -s --data curl --insecure --data host_config_key=_my_config_key_ \
 https://_tower.example.com_/api/v2/job_templates/_8_/callback/
----

Ensure that you use `https` when you enter the provisioning callback URL.

This triggers the playbook run specified in the template against the host.

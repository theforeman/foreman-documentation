= Using Red{nbsp}Hat Insights with Hosts in {Project}

You can use Red{nbsp}Hat Insights to diagnose systems and downtime related to security exploits, performance degradation and stability failures.
You can use the dashboard to quickly identify key risks to stability, security, and performance.
You can sort by category, view details of the impact and resolution, and then determine what systems are affected.

To use Red{nbsp}Hat Insights to monitor hosts that you manage with {Project}, you must first install Red{nbsp}Hat Insights on your hosts and register your hosts with Red{nbsp}Hat Insights.

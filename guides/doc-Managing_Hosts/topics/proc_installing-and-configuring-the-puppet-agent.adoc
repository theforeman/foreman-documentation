Use this procedure to install and configure the Puppet agent on a host. For more information about Puppet, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_satellite/{ProductVersion}/html/puppet_guide/[_Puppet Guide_].

.Prerequisites

* The host must be registered to Red{nbsp}Hat Satellite.
* The host must have a Puppet environment assigned to it.
* The Red{nbsp}Hat {project-client-name} repository must be enabled and synchronized on Satellite Server, and enabled on the host.

.Procedure

. Log in to the host as the `root` user.

. Install the Puppet agent package:
+

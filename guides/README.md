# Foreman Guides

This is upstream source code of [Red Hat Satellite 6](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_satellite) documentation.
All content in this repository uses [AsciiDoctor](https://asciidoctor.org/) syntax and aims to follow [Guidelines for Red Hat Documentation](https://redhat-documentation.github.io/).
This is a **work in progress**, an attempt to take content written by Red Hat documentation team, modularize it, incorporate [existing documentation](https://theforeman.org/documentation.html) and eventually make this the only and official documentation for Foreman, Katello and all plugins.

## Building

Install required tools.
In Fedora perform:

    dnf -y install ruby asciidoctor asciidoctor-pdf make linkchecker

In MacOS required tools can be installed via brew but instead "make" call "gmake":

    brew install asciidoctor make

Alternatively, XCode development environment can be installed to have make utility available on PATH, however this takes about an hour to download and install and requires several gigabytes of HDD space:

	xcode-select --install

If AsciiDoctor is not available in repositories or under RVM/rbenv, simply install it from rubygems:

  	gem install asciidoctor asciidoctor-pdf --pre

Then simply run `make` or `make html` which builds HTML artifacts.
Generating PDF output is slow, therefore command `make pdf` must be used separately.
To make both formats in one command, use `make html pdf`.

Few additional make targets are available on the guide level.
To quickly build HTML version and open new tab in a browser do:

    cd doc-Provisioning_Guide
    make browser

Similarly, to build and open PDF version do:

    make open-pdf

Currently there are three different versions


`make BUILD=foreman-el` - This is the default that is generated with `make html` or `pdf`.


`make BUILD=satellite` - This generates a downstream preview of the guide.


`make BUILD=foreman-deb` - This generates  a version for Foreman installed on Debian.


The final artifacts can be found in the ./build subdirectory.
Note that GNU Makefile tracks changes and only builds relevant artifacts, to trigger full rebuild use `make clean` to delete build directory and start over.

It's also possible to check links, the following command will check all links except example.com domain:

	make linkchecker

## Reading or Publishing

We do not publish the content yet to prevent users confusion, however this section will cover steps required to publish the content.
We should make sure that only the last stable version of the HTML document is indexed by search engines, old and nightly builds should not be indexed.
All PDFs should be available for download tho.

## Stylying

CSS styles are based on the official AsciiDoctor styles with some small modifications.
To generate the stylesheet:

	git clone https://github.com/lzap/asciidoctor-stylesheet-factory
	git checkout foreman-css
	compass compile

## Contributing

Please read [Guidelines for Red Hat Documentation](https://redhat-documentation.github.io/) before opening a Pull Request.
Additional rules apply:

Never write "Foreman" or "Satellite" words directly but use the following variables:

| Variable | Upstream value | Downstream value |
| -------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| {ProjectNameXY} | Foreman 1.22 | Red Hat Satellite 6.5 |
| {ProjectNameX} | Foreman | Red Hat Satellite 6 |
| {ProjectName} | Foreman | Red Hat Satellite |
| {ProjectXY} | Foreman 1.22 | Satellite 6.5 |
| {ProjectX} | Foreman | Satellite 6 |
| {Project} | Foreman | Satellite |
| {SmartProxyServer} | Smart Proxy server | Capsule Server |
| {SmartProxy} | Smart Proxy | Capsule |

The table only covers the most frequent terms, the rest is defined in the [included file](common/attributes.adoc).

Variables cannot be used in shell or code examples.
To use them, use "attributes" keyword:

	[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
	----
	# ls {VariableName}
	----

Hide or show specific blocks, paragraphs, warnings or chapters via special variable called "build".
Its value can be set either to "foreman-el" or "satellite":

	ifeval::["{build}" == "foreman-el"]
	NOTE: This part is only relevant for deployments with Katello plugin.
	endif::[]

When doing review, consider checking out the topic branch and putting necessary changes on top of author's work to making many comments on github.

We should avoid using phases like, "Starting from version 6.5 or 1.22" because it is not possible to easily translate these strings in both the streams.

## Structure

Files that are included in more than one guide have prefixes to distingish their type of content as follows:

* `con`: File starting with `con_` contain concepts and explain the _what_ and _why_.
* `proc`: Files starting with `proc_` contain procedures and explain _how_ to achieve a specific goal.
* `ref`: Files starting with `ref_` contain references and append other files, e.g. tables with options.
* `snip`: Files starting with `snip_` contain snippets that are reused throughout multiple guides, e.g. admonitions.

## Conventions

* User input is surrounded by underscores (`_`) to indicate variable input, e.g. `hammer organization create --name "_My Organization_" --label "_my_organization_"`.
* A single line only contains one sentence.
Please do not wrap lines by hand.
This makes `git diff` much easier to read and helps reviewing changes.
* No trailing whitespace on lines and in files.
Whitespace after partial files has to be handled in the file using the `include::` directive.
* Source files use UTF-8 character encoding.
* Image file names use dashes (`-`) and suffix a build target, e.g. `foreman`.

## The process (TODO)

This is what we are working on right now:

* [x] Initial import of Provisioning Guide
* [x] Provide Makefiles and Travis integration
* [x] Replace Satellite 6 with Foreman term
* [ ] Modularize content
* [ ] Hide irrelevant chapters
* [ ] Incorporate parts from upstream docs
* [ ] Incorporate https://community.theforeman.org/t/discovery-ipxe-efi-workflow-in-foreman-1-20/13026
* [ ] Write better introduction
* [ ] Add Anaconda-image based provisioning workflow
* [ ] Update with PXE Grub2 steps
* [ ] Discuss with Foreman community if to continue with other guides

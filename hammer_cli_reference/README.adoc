= Hammer CLI reference

foreman-documentation contains a Hammer CLI guide for all build flavours.
The guide contains a list of reference files that are based on Hammer CLI help output for a specific Foreman+Katello version and, optionally, Foreman+Katello plugins.

In *downstream* docs, each team maintains its own set of downstream-only commits that overwrite the assembly and add necessary reference files.
In *upstream* docs, the community can update the reference files based on a Foreman+Katello instance.

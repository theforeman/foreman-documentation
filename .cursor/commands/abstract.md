Review and improve the abstract for this file. Write it if it doesn't exist yet. Follow these principles:

* Make the abstract one or two sentences long.
* Do not use documentation self-referential language (for example: avoid "This procedure..." or "This module").
* Use user-centric language (for example: "You can...") rather than product-centric language (for example: "This feature...").
* Where appropriate, include an example use case (for example: the reason why and when a user might find the contents of the module useful).

</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="upgrading_prerequisites">1.1. Prerequisites</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Upgrading to Foreman 2.5 affects your entire Foreman infrastructure. Before proceeding, complete the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Read the Foreman 2.5 Release Notes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Review this guide so that you are aware of the upgrade process and its impact.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plan your upgrade path. For more information, see <a href="#upgrade_paths">Upgrade Paths</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plan for the required downtime. Foreman services are shut down during the upgrade. The upgrade process duration might vary depending on your hardware configuration, network speed, and the amount of data that is stored on the server.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Upgrading Foreman takes approximately 1 - 2 hours.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Upgrading Smart&#160;Proxy takes approximately 10 - 30 minutes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, upgrading from 2.4 to 2.5 also migrates Pulp content, this step can take some considerable time.
For more information on preparing for Pulp migration and the upgrade process, see <a href="#Upgrading_Server_upgrade-guide">Upgrading Foreman&#160;server</a>.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure that you have sufficient storage space on your server. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.theforeman.org/2.5/Installing_Server_on_Red_Hat/index-foreman-el.html#preparing-environment-for-satellite-installation">Preparing your Environment for Installation</a> in <em>Installing Foreman&#160;server from a Connected Network</em> and <a href="https://docs.theforeman.org/2.5/Installing_Proxy_on_Red_Hat/index-foreman-el.html#preparing-environment-for-capsule-installation">Preparing your Environment for Installation</a> in <em>Installing Smart&#160;Proxy&#160;server</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Back up your Foreman&#160;server and all Smart&#160;Proxy&#160;servers. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.theforeman.org/2.5/Administering_Red_Hat_Satellite/index-foreman-el.html##backing-up-satellite-server-and-capsule-server">Backing Up Foreman&#160;server and Smart&#160;Proxy&#160;server</a> in the <em>Administering Foreman 6.8</em> guide.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plan for updating any scripts you use that contain Foreman API commands because some API commands differ between versions of Foreman. For more information about changes in the API, see the Knowledgebase article <a href="https://access.redhat.com/articles/4396911">API Changes Between Foreman Versions</a> on the Red&#160;Hat Customer Portal.</p>

<p>The high level steps in upgrading to Foreman 2.5 are as follows.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Upgrade Foreman&#160;server and all Smart&#160;Proxy&#160;servers to Foreman 2.5. For more information, see <a href="#Upgrading_Server_upgrade-guide">Upgrading Foreman&#160;server</a>.</p>

</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="following_the_progress_of_the_upgrade">1.3. Following the Progress of the Upgrade</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because of the lengthy upgrade time, use a utility such as <code>screen</code> to suspend and reattach a communication session. You can then check the upgrade progress without staying connected to the command shell continuously. For more information about using the screen command, see <a href="https://access.redhat.com/articles/5247">How do I use the screen command?</a> article in the <em>Red&#160;Hat Knowledge&#160;Base</em>. You can also see the <code>screen</code> manual page for more information.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you lose connection to the command shell where the upgrade command is running you can see the logs in <code>/var/log/foreman-installer/foreman.log</code> to check if the process completed successfully.</p>

<h3 id="upgrading_capsules-separately-from-satellite_upgrade-guide">1.4. Upgrading Smart&#160;Proxies Separately from Foreman</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can upgrade Foreman to version 2.5 and keep Smart&#160;Proxies at version 2.4 until you have the capacity to upgrade them too.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All the functionality that worked previously works on 2.4 Smart&#160;Proxies. However, the functionality added in the 2.5 release will not work until you upgrade Smart&#160;Proxies to 2.5.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Upgrading Smart&#160;Proxies after upgrading Foreman can be useful in the following example scenarios:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>If you want to have several smaller outage windows instead of one larger window.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If Smart&#160;Proxies in your organization are managed by several teams and are located in different locations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you use a load-balanced configuration, you can upgrade one load-balanced Smart&#160;Proxy and keep other load-balanced Smart&#160;Proxies at 1 version lower. This allows you to upgrade all Smart&#160;Proxies one after another without any outage.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure that you do not delete the manifest from the Customer Portal or in the Foreman web UI because this removes all the entitlements of your content hosts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Back up and remove all Foreman hooks before upgrading.
Restore any hooks only after Foreman is known to be working after the upgrade is complete.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have edited any of the default templates, back up the files either by cloning or exporting them.
Cloning is the recommended method because that prevents them being overwritten in future updates or upgrades.
To confirm if a template has been edited, you can view its <strong>History</strong> before you upgrade or view the changes in the audit log after an upgrade.
In the Foreman web UI, navigate to <strong>Monitor</strong> &gt; <strong>Audits</strong> and search for the template to see a record of changes made.
If you use the export method, restore your changes by comparing the exported template and the default template, manually applying your changes.</p>

<h4 id="preparing_to_migrate_pulp_content">2.1.1. Preparing to Migrate Content to Pulp 3</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The time to prepare content for Pulp 3 depends on the amount of content and the number of Content Views.
For large systems, this can mean several days of downtime.
To prevent this, pre-migrate Pulp content while running the latest version of Foreman&#160;server 2.4.
This reduces the overall upgrade downtime.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During migration to Pulp3, the amount of data stored in the <code>/var/lib/pulp/published/</code> directory can double in size.
Ensure that there is enough space on the <code>/var/lib/pulp</code> volume.
If the user runs <code>foreman-maintain prep-6.10-upgrade</code>, the content in <code>/var/lib/pulp/content</code> does not need to be duplicated.
After Pulp2 is removed, the extra space can be claimed back, however, shrinking of XFS volumes is not possible and copying data to a different partition might be necessary in order to bring volume size down to the previous value.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During migration to Pulp 3, the amount of data stored in the PostgreSQL data directory can grow significantly.
Ensure that you have enough space for the migration.
A rough estimation of the space you require is 2-3 times the size of the MongoDB Pulp 2 database.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Pre-Migration Checks</div>
<p>The sequence should always be if you have any Composite Content Views, take action on those first, and then work on the Content Views.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Ensure that all enabled repositories complete the synchronization process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If any repositories are synced with a <strong>Warning</strong> or <strong>Error</strong> state, fix the underlying problem and resync the repository.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure that no paused tasks in the system are related to any repositories or Content Views.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you no longer require specific Content Views or Composite Content View Versions, you can perform a cleanup action.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>If you no longer require or use certain repositories, disable those specific repositories.</p>

<p>There is some mismatch between subsystems in Foreman such as Katello and Pulp.
This can happen if a repository or content view is improperly deleted by skipping steps in a paused Foreman Task.
Running <code>foreman-rake katello:correct_repositories COMMIT=true</code> can correct this.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can review the list of corrupt or missing RPMs written to disk as part of the <code>foreman-maintain content migration-stats command</code>, <code>/tmp/unmigratable_content-20211025-74422-16cxfae20211120-2149-1j4pmfae</code> in the example above.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If there is a large percentage of missing or corrupted RPMs, for example, more than 5-10%, Foreman developers recommends that you review the list generated and contact support for guidance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In most cases, where the number of missing or corrupt RPMs is low, you can mark these as skipped using the following command:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="nowrap"># foreman-rake katello:approve_corrupted_migration_content</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you approve corrupted or missing content and proceed with the upgrade, that content will not appear in the repositories or content view versions after upgrade.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If these packages exist in the upstream repositories, they are added again when you re-synchronize the repositories after upgrade.
They are not restored to the Content Views unless you republish those Content Views.
As these packages are likely unusable, the upgrade process only detects that fact.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you suspect a Repository synchronization or Content View publish or promotion occurred during the migration, re-running <code>foreman-maintain content prepare</code> migrates the remaining content.
If this is the first time you have run <code>foreman-maintain content prepare</code>, Foreman developers recommends running it as often as necessary to try to reduce the number of corrupt or missing RPMs.
Migrating the remaining content then takes less time.</p>

<h3 id="tuning-with-predefined-profiles_upgrade-guide">3.6. Tuning Foreman&#160;server with Predefined Profiles</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If your Foreman deployment includes more than 5000 hosts, you can use predefined tuning profiles to improve performance of Foreman.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that you cannot use tuning profiles on Smart&#160;Proxies.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can choose one of the profiles depending on the number of hosts your Foreman manages and available hardware resources.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The tuning profiles are available in the <code>/usr/share/foreman-installer/config/foreman.hiera/tuning/sizes</code> directory.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you run the <code>foreman-installer</code> command with the <code>--tuning</code> option, deployment configuration settings are applied to Foreman in the following order:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>The default tuning profile defined in the <code>/usr/share/foreman-installer/config/foreman.hiera/tuning/common.yaml</code> file</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The tuning profile that you want to apply to your deployment and is defined in the <code>/usr/share/foreman-installer/config/foreman.hiera/tuning/sizes/</code> directory</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optional: If you have configured a <code>/etc/foreman-installer/custom-hiera.yaml</code> file, Foreman applies these configuration settings.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that the configuration settings that are defined in the <code>/etc/foreman-installer/custom-hiera.yaml</code> file override the configuration settings that are defined in the tuning profiles.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Therefore, before applying a tuning profile, you must compare the configuration settings that are defined in the default tuning profile in <code>/usr/share/foreman-installer/config/foreman.hiera/tuning/common.yaml</code>, the tuning profile that you want to apply and your <code>/etc/foreman-installer/custom-hiera.yaml</code> file, and remove any duplicated configuration from the <code>/etc/foreman-installer/custom-hiera.yaml</code> file.</p>

<li>
<p>Perform the upgrade:</p>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="nowrap"># foreman-maintain upgrade run --target-version 6.10.<em>z</em></pre>

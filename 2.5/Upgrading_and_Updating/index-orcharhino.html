<p>Note that you can upgrade orcharhino Proxies separately from orcharhino. For more information, see <a href="#upgrading_capsules-separately-from-satellite_upgrade-guide">Upgrading orcharhino Proxies Separately from orcharhino</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="upgrading_prerequisites">1.1. Prerequisites</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Upgrading to orcharhino 2.1.3 affects your entire orcharhino infrastructure. Before proceeding, complete the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Read the orcharhino 2.1.3 Release Notes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Review this guide so that you are aware of the upgrade process and its impact.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plan your upgrade path. For more information, see <a href="#upgrade_paths">Upgrade Paths</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plan for the required downtime. orcharhino services are shut down during the upgrade. The upgrade process duration might vary depending on your hardware configuration, network speed, and the amount of data that is stored on the server.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Upgrading orcharhino takes approximately 1 - 2 hours.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Upgrading orcharhino Proxy takes approximately 10 - 30 minutes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, upgrading from 2.4 to 2.1.3 also migrates Pulp content, this step can take some considerable time.
For more information on preparing for Pulp migration and the upgrade process, see <a href="#Upgrading_Server_upgrade-guide">Upgrading orcharhino server</a>.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure that you have sufficient storage space on your server. For more information, see <a href="sources/installation_and_maintenance/orcharhino_installation_guide.html#preparing-environment-for-satellite-installation">Preparing your Environment for Installation</a> in <em>Installing orcharhino server from a Connected Network</em> and <a href="sources/installation_and_maintenance/orcharhino_proxy_installation_guide.html#preparing-environment-for-capsule-installation">Preparing your Environment for Installation</a> in <em>Installing orcharhino Proxy</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Back up your orcharhino server and all orcharhino Proxys.

</li>
<li>
<p>Plan for updating any scripts you use that contain orcharhino API commands because some API commands differ between versions of orcharhino. For more information about changes in the API, see the Knowledgebase article <a href="https://access.redhat.com/articles/4396911">API Changes Between orcharhino Versions</a> on the Red&#160;Hat Customer Portal.</p>

<h3 id="following_the_progress_of_the_upgrade">1.3. Following the Progress of the Upgrade</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because of the lengthy upgrade time, use a utility such as <code>screen</code> to suspend and reattach a communication session. You can then check the upgrade progress without staying connected to the command shell continuously. For more information about using the screen command, see <a href="https://access.redhat.com/articles/5247">How do I use the screen command?</a> article in the <em>Red&#160;Hat Knowledge&#160;Base</em>. You can also see the <code>screen</code> manual page for more information.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you lose connection to the command shell where the upgrade command is running you can see the logs in <code>/var/log/foreman-installer/foreman.log</code> to check if the process completed successfully.</p>

<h3 id="upgrading_capsules-separately-from-satellite_upgrade-guide">1.4. Upgrading orcharhino Proxies Separately from orcharhino</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can upgrade orcharhino to version 2.1.3 and keep orcharhino Proxies at version 2.4 until you have the capacity to upgrade them too.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All the functionality that worked previously works on 2.4 orcharhino Proxies. However, the functionality added in the 2.1.3 release will not work until you upgrade orcharhino Proxies to 2.1.3.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Upgrading orcharhino Proxies after upgrading orcharhino can be useful in the following example scenarios:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>If you want to have several smaller outage windows instead of one larger window.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If orcharhino Proxies in your organization are managed by several teams and are located in different locations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you use a load-balanced configuration, you can upgrade one load-balanced orcharhino Proxy and keep other load-balanced orcharhino Proxies at 1 version lower. This allows you to upgrade all orcharhino Proxies one after another without any outage.</p>

<li>
<p>Ensure that you do not delete the manifest from the Customer Portal or in the orcharhino management UI because this removes all the entitlements of your content hosts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Back up and remove all Foreman hooks before upgrading.
Restore any hooks only after orcharhino is known to be working after the upgrade is complete.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have edited any of the default templates, back up the files either by cloning or exporting them.
Cloning is the recommended method because that prevents them being overwritten in future updates or upgrades.
To confirm if a template has been edited, you can view its <strong>History</strong> before you upgrade or view the changes in the audit log after an upgrade.
In the orcharhino management UI, navigate to <strong>Monitor</strong> &gt; <strong>Audits</strong> and search for the template to see a record of changes made.
If you use the export method, restore your changes by comparing the exported template and the default template, manually applying your changes.</p>

<h4 id="preparing_to_migrate_pulp_content">2.1.1. Preparing to Migrate Content to Pulp 3</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The time to prepare content for Pulp 3 depends on the amount of content and the number of Content Views.
For large systems, this can mean several days of downtime.
To prevent this, pre-migrate Pulp content while running the latest version of orcharhino server 2.4.
This reduces the overall upgrade downtime.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During migration to Pulp3, the amount of data stored in the <code>/var/lib/pulp/published/</code> directory can double in size.
Ensure that there is enough space on the <code>/var/lib/pulp</code> volume.
If the user runs <code>foreman-maintain prep-6.10-upgrade</code>, the content in <code>/var/lib/pulp/content</code> does not need to be duplicated.
After Pulp2 is removed, the extra space can be claimed back, however, shrinking of XFS volumes is not possible and copying data to a different partition might be necessary in order to bring volume size down to the previous value.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During migration to Pulp 3, the amount of data stored in the PostgreSQL data directory can grow significantly.
Ensure that you have enough space for the migration.
A rough estimation of the space you require is 2-3 times the size of the MongoDB Pulp 2 database.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Pre-Migration Checks</div>

</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure that no paused tasks in the system are related to any repositories or Content Views.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you no longer require specific Content Views or Composite Content View Versions, you can perform a cleanup action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For more information about how to perform the cleanup, see <a href="https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2760531">How to remove old content view versions in Red Hat Satellite 6 using CLI/hammer?</a> .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If some Content View or Composite Content View versions are not required anymore, please consider performing a cleanup of them.</p>

<p>For more information about how to perform the cleanup of older Content View or Composite Content View versions using <code>hammer_cli</code>, see <a href="https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2760531">How to remove old content view versions in Red Hat Satellite 6 using CLI/hammer?</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you no longer require or use certain repositories, disable those specific repositories.</p>

  Corrupted or Missing Rpm: 1000/104583
  Corrupted or missing content has been detected, you can examine the list of content in /tmp/unmigratable_content-20211025-74422-16cxfae and take action by either:
  1. Performing a 'Verify Checksum' sync under Advanced Sync Options, let it complete, and re-running the migration
  2. Deleting/disabling the affected repositories and running orphan cleanup (foreman-rake katello:delete_orphaned_content) and re-running the migration.
  3. Manually correcting files on the filesystem in /var/lib/pulp/content/ and re-running the migration
  4. Mark currently corrupted or missing content as skipped (foreman-rake katello:approve_corrupted_migration_content). This will skip migration of missing or corrupted content.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are several causes of corrupted or missing content:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>A Repository synchronization or Content View publish or promotion occurred during the migration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Files on disk in <code>/var/lib/pulp/content/</code> became corrupted due to disk rot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Files in <code>/var/lib/pulp/content/</code> are missing due to past events such as disk loss with a partial restore.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is some mismatch between subsystems in orcharhino such as Katello and Pulp.
This can happen if a repository or content view is improperly deleted by skipping steps in a paused orcharhino Task.
Running <code>foreman-rake katello:correct_repositories COMMIT=true</code> can correct this.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can review the list of corrupt or missing RPMs written to disk as part of the <code>foreman-maintain content migration-stats command</code>, <code>/tmp/unmigratable_content-20211025-74422-16cxfae20211120-2149-1j4pmfae</code> in the example above.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For more information about determining which repository the unmigratable contents belong to, see <a href="https://access.redhat.com/solutions/6629271">How to determine the repository to run Verify Checksum on for reported corrupted RPMs</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In most cases, where repositories with unmigratable contents are configured on orcharhino with the <strong>On-demand</strong> download policy and the number of missing or corrupt RPMs are low, you can mark these as skipped using the command:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="nowrap"># foreman-rake katello:approve_corrupted_migration_content</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you approve corrupted or missing content and proceed with the upgrade, that content will not appear in the repositories or content view versions after upgrade.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If these packages exist in the upstream repositories, they are added again when you re-synchronize the repositories after upgrade.
They are not restored to the Content Views unless you republish those Content Views.
As these packages are likely unusable, the upgrade process only detects that fact.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you suspect a Repository synchronization or Content View publish or promotion occurred during the migration, re-running <code>foreman-maintain content prepare</code> migrates the remaining content.
If this is the first time you have run <code>foreman-maintain content prepare</code>, ATIX AG recommends running it as often as necessary to try to reduce the number of corrupt or missing RPMs.
Migrating the remaining content then takes less time.</p>

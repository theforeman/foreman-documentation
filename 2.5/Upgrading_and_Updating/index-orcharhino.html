<p>For interactive upgrade instructions, you can also use the orcharhino Upgrade Helper on the Red&#160;Hat Customer Portal. This application provides you with an exact guide to match your current version number. You can find instructions that are specific to your upgrade path, as well as steps to prevent known issues. For more information, see <a href="https://access.redhat.com/labs/satelliteupgradehelper/">orcharhino Upgrade Helper</a> on the customer portal.</p>

<p>Note that you can upgrade orcharhino Proxies separately from orcharhino. For more information, see <a href="#upgrading_capsules-separately-from-satellite_upgrade-guide">Upgrading orcharhino Proxies Separately from orcharhino</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="upgrading_prerequisites">1.1. Prerequisites</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Upgrading to orcharhino 2.1.3 affects your entire orcharhino infrastructure. Before proceeding, complete the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Read the orcharhino 2.1.3 Release Notes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Review this guide so that you are aware of the upgrade process and its impact.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plan your upgrade path. For more information, see <a href="#upgrade_paths">Upgrade Paths</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plan for the required downtime. orcharhino services are shut down during the upgrade. The upgrade process duration might vary depending on your hardware configuration, network speed, and the amount of data that is stored on the server.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Upgrading orcharhino takes approximately 1 - 2 hours.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Upgrading orcharhino Proxy takes approximately 10 - 30 minutes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, upgrading from 2.4 to 2.1.3 also migrates Pulp content, this step can take some considerable time.
For more information on preparing for Pulp migration and the upgrade process, see <a href="#Upgrading_Server_upgrade-guide">Upgrading orcharhino server</a>.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure that you have sufficient storage space on your server. For more information, see <a href="sources/installation_and_maintenance/orcharhino_installation_guide.html#preparing-environment-for-satellite-installation">Preparing your Environment for Installation</a> in <em>Installing orcharhino server from a Connected Network</em> and <a href="sources/installation_and_maintenance/orcharhino_proxy_installation_guide.html#preparing-environment-for-capsule-installation">Preparing your Environment for Installation</a> in <em>Installing orcharhino Proxy</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Back up your orcharhino server and all orcharhino Proxys. For more information, see <a href="sources/management_ui/the_administer_menu.html##backing-up-satellite-server-and-capsule-server">Backing Up orcharhino server and orcharhino Proxy</a> in the <em>Administering orcharhino 5.6</em> guide.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plan for updating any scripts you use that contain orcharhino API commands because some API commands differ between versions of orcharhino. For more information about changes in the API, see the Knowledgebase article <a href="https://access.redhat.com/articles/4396911">API Changes Between orcharhino Versions</a> on the Red&#160;Hat Customer Portal.</p>

<p>The high level steps in upgrading to orcharhino 2.1.3 are as follows.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Upgrade orcharhino server and all orcharhino Proxys to orcharhino 2.1.3. For more information, see <a href="#Upgrading_Server_upgrade-guide">Upgrading orcharhino server</a>.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="following_the_progress_of_the_upgrade">1.3. Following the Progress of the Upgrade</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because of the lengthy upgrade time, use a utility such as <code>screen</code> to suspend and reattach a communication session. You can then check the upgrade progress without staying connected to the command shell continuously. For more information about using the screen command, see <a href="https://access.redhat.com/articles/5247">How do I use the screen command?</a> article in the <em>Red&#160;Hat Knowledge&#160;Base</em>. You can also see the <code>screen</code> manual page for more information.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you lose connection to the command shell where the upgrade command is running you can see the logs in <code>/var/log/foreman-installer/foreman.log</code> to check if the process completed successfully.</p>

<h3 id="upgrading_capsules-separately-from-satellite_upgrade-guide">1.4. Upgrading orcharhino Proxies Separately from orcharhino</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can upgrade orcharhino to version 2.1.3 and keep orcharhino Proxies at version 2.4 until you have the capacity to upgrade them too.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All the functionality that worked previously works on 2.4 orcharhino Proxies. However, the functionality added in the 2.1.3 release will not work until you upgrade orcharhino Proxies to 2.1.3.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Upgrading orcharhino Proxies after upgrading orcharhino can be useful in the following example scenarios:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>If you want to have several smaller outage windows instead of one larger window.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If orcharhino Proxies in your organization are managed by several teams and are located in different locations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you use a load-balanced configuration, you can upgrade one load-balanced orcharhino Proxy and keep other load-balanced orcharhino Proxies at 1 version lower. This allows you to upgrade all orcharhino Proxies one after another without any outage.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure that you do not delete the manifest from the Customer Portal or in the orcharhino management UI because this removes all the entitlements of your content hosts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Back up and remove all Foreman hooks before upgrading.
Restore any hooks only after orcharhino is known to be working after the upgrade is complete.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have edited any of the default templates, back up the files either by cloning or exporting them.
Cloning is the recommended method because that prevents them being overwritten in future updates or upgrades.
To confirm if a template has been edited, you can view its <strong>History</strong> before you upgrade or view the changes in the audit log after an upgrade.
In the orcharhino management UI, navigate to <strong>Monitor</strong> &gt; <strong>Audits</strong> and search for the template to see a record of changes made.
If you use the export method, restore your changes by comparing the exported template and the default template, manually applying your changes.</p>

<h4 id="preparing_to_migrate_pulp_content">2.1.1. Preparing to Migrate Content to Pulp 3</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The time to prepare content for Pulp 3 depends on the amount of content and the number of content views.
For large systems, this can mean several days of downtime.
To prevent this, pre-migrate Pulp content while running the latest version of orcharhino server 2.4.
This reduces the overall upgrade downtime.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During migration to Pulp3, the amount of data stored in the <code>/var/lib/pulp/published/</code> directory can double in size.
Ensure that there is enough space on the <code>/var/lib/pulp</code> volume.
If the user runs <code>foreman-maintain prep-6.10-upgrade</code>, the content in <code>/var/lib/pulp/content</code> does not need to be duplicated.
After Pulp2 is removed, the extra space can be claimed back, however, shrinking of XFS volumes is not possible and copying data to a different partition might be necessary in order to bring volume size down to the previous value.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During migration to Pulp 3, the amount of data stored in the PostgreSQL data directory can grow significantly.
Ensure that you have enough space for the migration.
A rough estimation of the space you require is 2-3 times the size of the MongoDB Pulp 2 database.</p>
</div>
